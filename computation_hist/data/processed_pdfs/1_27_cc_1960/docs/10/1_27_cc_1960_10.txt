Memorandum to

 

From P.m.morse, Director E. I. T. Computation Center.

Subject: Replacement of 704 by a 7090.

Back’round - In June, 1957, somewhat less than three years
ago, wJ§O4 was installed at the Computation Center by IRE, under
a special agreement whereby IBM maintains the equipment, contri—
butes toward amortizing the additions to the Compton Laboratory
which house the Center and supports a number of research asso—
ciates who assist users of the machine, and EIT staffs and oper-
ates the Center for the use of HIT and other cooperating New
England colleges and universities. The primary purpose of the
arrangement is to enable students anﬂ faculty of these instit—
utions to learn how to use high—speed conputing machines, so that
the next generation of scientists, engineers and industrial exec-
utives will be familiar with machine capabilities -- in other
words the primary purpose is to demonstrate that such machines
are as important a @art of the educational equipment of a modern
college as are chemistry laboratories, for example. A secondary
purpose is to foster research in the use of computing machines,
particularly in those fields of application which have not yet
been explored or exploited fully.

To this end, priority on 704 tine has been accorded to
regular class use by courses in machine programming and applicau

 

tions, to students using the na .esis research

and to research projects inveso

special coding courses which are given by the Center staff during
each term and summer. A number of other oollegeu bring some of
their classes in for one or more laboratory sessions. Class use
will expand further, but its expansion will be hall‘gered bfy the
limitations of access to the 704-, as will be discussed later.

The use of the machine by the other colleges has expanded
rapidly until nearly a full shift is now occupied with their work
(including their class exercises). But this use tense to be self-
limiting for, as soon as a college faculty begins fully to apprec—
iate the possibilities in education and research of computers, the
pressure builds up for a machine of their own on their own campus.

these instituions still come to the Center to use the 701! for their
bigger jobs; but it does mean that the use of the Center W the
other New England. colleges will tend to level off to a reelenable
load (about one shift, it now appears) rather than growing :ontin-
uously, as the HIT usage is doing. This result, of course? is in
accord with. our conviction that computers should be as prevatgnt
as chemistry laboratories. ‘

In contrast, the MIT use of the 704 for research into law

 

 

applications has grown so that new we are not able to satisfy ll

Tine—sharing Technigues: we already have a typewriter connected
to the 704, which works on a time—sharing basis with our regular
operator routine, so new programs can be debugged at the same time
that regular computations are being carried out on other problems,
for example. The 704 cannot effectively accomodate more than one
or two such sa telite channels, but the Center staff is now at work
on t%%)design and programming required to provide a 7090 with 6/0

capacities, which can be placed at appropriate places around LIT,

These, and many other programs now in progress, such as
the character-recognition studies ~ 1 m ", , the research
on economic forecasting and on operational behavior using large-
soale simulation techniques, should be of particular interest to
IBh, for they have direct bearing on the progress of computer
design and utilization. They represent the sort of cooperative
research between experts in different fields which MIT does so
eficctively, and they involve the combination of research and
education for which HIT is pro—eminent. This work deserves
support by IBM, in addition to the educational activities which
are already being supagigegqu the present contribution of the 704.
They can most effectivelyh y the installation of a 7090, replacing
the 70#, in the near future; MIT will then be able to provide
the staff and ancillary equigment to push ahead with dispatch.
Because of the "inter~connoctedness“ of much of this research,

other new directions, which involve machine use (meteorology,
nuclear reactor design ani the like) should be supborted by the

Center by grants of some time only while they are in the formative
stage, before they have been shown to be so obviously-practical
that they can ask for financial support,for further computation,
in their own right. By the time they have developed their pro-
grams and their special techniques of machine use, and are ready
to,exploit these methods by long "production runs", they should be
in a position to obtain financing to run these computations on

one of the several other similar machines which are or will be

in operation in the vicinity.

Even with this sort of limitation on the use of the Center
facilities, the demands on the Center will grow. But the growth,
if thus limited, will, we believe, be a manageable one, in keeping
with what could be implemented by the cooperative effort of IBM
and MIT. A 7090 within the year would not delay most of the work
outlined above too seriousl . And, as outlined below, it would
be able to handle them for several years, while plane are made
for the next step. On the other hand, if a 7090 cannot be provided
soon, several of the projects mentioned above will have to termin—
ate or else will have to use other machines, which would inev-
itably mean the dissipation of the Center's usefulness in
coordinating this sort of research.

It is not intended that the Center should have a monopoly
of all computing around all; this would be unrealistic and, as

indicated above, impossible. But it must play an active role in
