In addition to the above arrangements which IBM is making to the registrants
on a gratis basis, 'Dr. Hui-d wanted to amphas '

at MET during the two-week coarse.


Conference with New Products Division

 

M: s meeting with Kessrs. D. Pendery and II. Raising, a. umber of the

l‘ 704 alterations, modifications, etc” were discussed. In particular, the recent
list of 3m items were evaluated in lint of the [Bl-Ii" node of operation in
the Computation Center.

:

It was suggested that a copy of the MIT computer efforts should be
given to the group in order to provide them with certain written materiel ,
regarding pest HIT programing efforts in this area. After this manual has
been studied, a later meeting will be arranged to discuss additional requirements
on the ”future generation machines".

 

 

 

7.0 New York Date Processﬁ Center ‘ a"

At a conference with Mr. Bruce Oldfield, hanger, Data Processing Center,
he was asked to provide a list o! the M items, additional features, alterations,
etc., ourrently available on the New York and Poushkeepsie machines. In this
manner, the MIT 704 would provide complete compatibility to the two instilletions.

Oldfield was also asked to provide us with the list of control panels

and other equipment which are currently in- use at the other two installations --
again attempting to insure comatibility.

8.0 704 Training Course . _ .

 

A number of meetings were held with various members of the 13.!
Educational Department to obtain any information which could be used. in the 704
course which is to he oriered by HIT on August 20—31. It was finally agreed that
this matter could be handled by a separate meeting at MIT on Friday, August 27,

which would be attended by Messrs. E.Kop1ey, 3. Best, G. T. Hunter, F. M. Vorzuh,
and other MIT 704 staff. .

9 .0 Conclusion

Generally speaking, this day-long session; of meetings was highly
satisfactory. In certain cases, however, it was apparent. that insufficient
factual data was available and steps were taken to obtain mediate information.
Specifically, lebate would obtain additional noise measurements at New York on
Saturday, July 28. Similarly, Eonley, et el, will meet at HIT on Friday,

July 27, to help formulate the program for the 704. course. Finally, information
concerned with real estate -— furniture, equipment requirements, etc., will

be compiled during the next two weeks in order that orders may he pliced,
. purchases made, otc., during the current fiscal period. If this is done now,

equipment v15 11 arrive on schedule and (we hope) at the completion of the
building on January 1,1997.
