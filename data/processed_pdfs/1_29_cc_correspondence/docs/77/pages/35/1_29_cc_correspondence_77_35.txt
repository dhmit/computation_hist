ABSOLUTE
ASSENBLIES

APPENDIX

An absolute assembly feature has been added so that FAP
may be used to assemble programs that will be run outside

the FORTRAN Monitor.

Absolute assemblies are specified by the ABS pseudo-
operation. ABS must appear in the operation field, and
this card must appear just after the FAP card at the

beginning of the assembly.

In an absolute assembly, the following pseudo-operations

are not permitted: COMION, ENTRY, and CALL.

The following pscudo-operations, not permissible other-
wise, may be used: ORG, HEAD, HED, and TCD. The form
of END is modified.

ORG is used to set the next location to be assigned by
the assembler to a desired value. DBlanks or a symbol
may appear in the location field, ORG in the operation
field, and a pre-defined expression in the variable field.
The symbol in the location field is defined to have the
value of the expression in the variable field. The value
of the expression in the variable field is taken by the

assembler to be the next location assigned.

The HEAD and HED pseudo-operations make it possible to
prefix each symbol of a section of program by a "heading"
character. Using different heading characters in two
sections of programs removes any ambiguity as to the
definition of a symbol. All symbols of 5 characters or
less following a HEAD or HED pseudo-operation are pre-

'

fixed by the '"heading'' character until another HEAD or

HED is encountered. Six character symbols are immune
