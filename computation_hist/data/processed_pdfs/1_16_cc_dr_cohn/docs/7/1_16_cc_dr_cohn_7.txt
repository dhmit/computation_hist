MODULAR FUNCTIONS DEFINED BY
PERTURBATION MAPPINGS‘

HARVEY COHN

1. Introduction. There seem to be at least two different methods
of deﬁmng invariants I (z) for Mchsian groups, such as the modular
group, given by the transformations

(1) z —>zr = (0.1 + b)/(cz + (1), ad — bo = l,
where :1, b, c, d are integers. The function 1(2) is to satisfy the con-
dition
(2) [(2’) = [(2) for Imz > 0.
The ﬁrst method is to deﬁne the so-called Eisenstein series,

formed with terms arising from the denominators of the transforma-
tions, such as

(3) Ewe) = 2qu (p: + qr"

summed (once) over each reduced fraction p/q (positive, negative,
0/1, and 1/0). It is easily seen that for even m g 4 the series con-
verges absolutely to a sum not identically zero and, from the con~
vergence,

(4) Em(zT) = (cz + d)"E,,.(z).

To form a genuine invariant (with property (2)), we take a combina-
tion [3] such as

(5) J (a) = E¢:(2)/[E43(2) - 1352(2)],

giving J (z), the well-known invariant. It turns out that all in-
variants are single-valued functions of J (z).

The second method, due to Dedekind [1], is to start out with the
fundamental domain, in the z»plane, and let [(2) be an actual mapping
function that identiﬁes the portions of the boundary that correspond

iant is less simple. We here restrict

ourselves to the modular group, h0p_

ing to make a general approach on a

later occasion. Our purpose now is to

indicate a basis for liaison between

methods by showing that the Eisen-

Z’Dlone stein series E4(z) can be deﬁned through

Fm, 1 the conformal mapping of a region

with a perturbation boundary (the in-

dividual term of the Eisenstein series being regarded as the contribu-

tion of a speciﬁc “perturbation circle”). Although the modular-

function methods are quite classical, critical use is made of the more
current idea of variation of the boundary.1

2. The perturbation map. We consider the perturbation caused
to the fundamental domain 3)“ by removing the portion above the line
Imz = Us (5 < 1). The remaining (ﬁnite) portion, 3L , is mapped
by the modular group 2 —> 21 (of equation (1)) onto a portion of the
upper half z-plane, 11. , which is constructed by removing from the
upper half z-plane the interior of a circle called C,/q(e), tangent to the
real axis at p/q (*1/0) and of diameter e/qz. (For consistency, “the
interior of 01/n(€')” denotes the region Im 2 > l/e). Thus 11. is
a simply connected region of the 2-plane, invariant under the modular
group. (See Fig. 1.)

We now deﬁne f = {.(z) to be the mapping of H. onto the upper

The existence of such a limit is suggested by the next section which
indicates the connection with the Eisenstein series. The prodf of its
existence requires the major portion of this paper.

3. Approximation by superposition. The series expansion P(z)
is derived ﬁrst from the assumption that each perturbing circle is
approximately independent of the others. For instance, if just
(the interior of) one circle Cm(e) were deleted from the upper half
zApla/ne, the corresponding mapping function (ha/”(2) (with ﬁxed
direction element at 1') would easily be given by

Then, letting e —> 0, we should have the approximation

The terms in 62 are the “perturbation terms,” which (see equation
(7)) we should “superimpose” to obtain formally:

or, reducing the general term, we should ﬁnd

(9)

(10) P(z) = z“ e 52/2 — :11 Z./.q‘“<p + 42)?

Rather than justify the approximation directly (even on the
assumption that the limit (6) exists), we shall give what we hope is a
more revealing veriﬁcation by deeper methods, more characteristic of
the theory of modular functions. In the meantime we observe, term

by term,

We shall diﬁerentiate equation (12) with respect to e2 (at e = 0) and
obtain the transformations of P(z), as deﬁned in equation (6), under

the modular group. (See § 7.)

6. Order of magnitude. From the value of 71 in equation (15)
it follows that for z in 5,
(17) \l = z + 0(17).

Using the power-series expansion of the logarithm, we ﬁnd that it is
approximated by f + 001(3). Thus equation (17) leads to

(18) r+ 0073) = z + 0(71),
and from this,
(19) (r — 2W = Oct),

which is ac“) as e —+ 0.

Now from (19) the limit (6), deﬁning P(z), must exist at least
for a subsequence of e. The uniqueness of the limit will follow,
later, from the fact that we are dealing with a regular function, P(z),
completely characterized by certain transformation equations (21*)
and (22*) (below), together with the estimate (from (19)),

7. Transformation equations. From the definition of {,(z) in
§ 2, it follows immediately that

To obtain the linear transformation representing ((2 + 1), we note

that, in Figure 2, 2T = z + 1 must map the arc w’ﬁ’ onto «49, Thus
we find

Next, using the values given in §5 together with equations (6) and

(16), we obtain in a straightforward manner f
terms in 11: ’01“ the ﬁrSt-order

(21*) P(-1/2) = P(2>/zz,
(22*) P(2 + 1) = P(z) + 32' + 32 — s.
More generally, by this technique we see that
(23) P (oz + b) = P(z) + 11(2)

where (1(2) is a quadratic polynomial. (Here 2 62 d 2 - _

8. Final identiﬁcation of the perturbation function. Here armed
with equations (20), (21 *), and (22*), we can establish the exhansion
(10). Let the right-hand side of (10) be denoted by 3(2). It can be
formally veriﬁed that 3(2) satisﬁes properties (20), (21*), and (22*).
Thus, letting U(z) = P(z) — S(2), we find

(24) U(—1/z) = U(z)/z2
(25) U(z + 1) = U(z)
(26) U(z) = 0(23) as 2 —) ion,

and, in addition, U(z) is regular when Im z > 0.

Now we assert that such a U(z) is identically zero. For since
the function 4>(z) = U(z)J’(z) is invariant under the modular group,
by conditions (24) and (25), it is a single—valued function of J (2).
Furthermore, by condition (26), 4>(z) is not ‘ large enough" to be
anything but linear, i,e., ¢(z) = pJ(z) + a, for constants p and 0'.
Finally, the constants p, a both vanish since d>(z) = 0 at z : i and
z = % + ix/§/2, This establishes the expansion (10) (which is,
however, most naturally derived by the heuristic method of §3).
