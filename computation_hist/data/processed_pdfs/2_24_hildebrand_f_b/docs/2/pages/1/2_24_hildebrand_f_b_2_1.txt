Dear Professor Martin:

In accordance with the request received from
Professor Morse, the following calculating machines have
been transferred to Room Z-263 for student use in connec-
tion with Subject M4l1.

Serial Purchase Purchase

Marchant CA-16 195292 8-place 5«10«45 $546.,
$5414.25

These machines were purchased by the Center of Analysis for
use in the desk-calculator section., More recently, these
machines have been used jointly by the staff of the Numerical
Analysis Laboratory and by students in the former numerical
analysis subjects 6.531 - 6,534,

It iIs evident from the above purchase dates that
the machines are not new and have seen considerable use, I
have therefore recommended that the existing service con=-
tracts on the Marchant calculators be maintained in order
that reliable service will be available during the forth-
coming period of heavy student use. Accordingly, I have
submitted 5 invoices ($30 per year per machine) to
Miss Goodwin for payment.

Neither the Monroe or the National Cash Register
machines have been on a service contract, and repairs are
therefore obtained by calling the respective agency.
