8. Section D and E

During the second quarter we have completed production runs for the
following parameters:

M=2 all values of RHO

Meg 11 1 "oe
H=8 Mm "on
for two values of C: 2 Vo 372, 2

 

We are now trying to modify the program so that the cage M = ] can

be run and the sum of Q be computed analytically.
