From P.li.llorse, Director [i, I. T, Computation Center,

Subject: feplaceuent of 704 by a 7090,

Béck‘round = In June, 1957, somewhat less than three years
ago, a%?OQ wes installed at the Computation Centerp by IBli, under
& special agrecment whereby IBI maintains the equipment, contrie
butes toward amortizing the additions to the Compton JabowquoryvA
which house the Center and sSupports a number of es arcﬁzsgi‘;iw
ciates who assist users of the machine, and Lf& stafif# and oper-
ates the Center for the use of MIT and other cooperating New
England colleges and universities, The brimary purpose of the
arranzement ' is to enable students and fa aculty of thes it=-
utions to learn how to use high-speed computing macht&tau&zo that
the next mener%x:ng9£&§01entiscs engineers and nduutrval exec=
utives will oeA ek nachine capabilities e in other
words the primary purpose is to demonstrate that | such machines

are as important a part of the educational eguipment of a modern
1a

t
college as are chenistry aboratories, for xXanple, A secondary

-~

purpose is to foster research in the use of computing machines,

u
particularly in those fields of applicstion which have no+t yet
been explored or exploited fully,

To this end, priority on 704 time has been accorded to
regular class use Dy courses in machine pProgramning and anplicae
tions, to students usine + hine
