SYMBOLS

 

THE FAP LANGUAGE

Symbolic instructions are punched, one per card, in the

SCAT format. This format consists of four major fields:

the location field (always a fixed length of 6 characters),
the operation field (from 3 through 7 characters in length),
the variable field (variable length), and the comment field
(variable length). The fields are separated by the character,
blank., The location field always begins in column 1 (hence
ends in column 6), The operation field begins in column 8
and ends in one of columns 10-14, The variable field begins
one column after the end of the operation field (hence always
before column 17) and may extend through column 72, (By
convention, the variable field usually begins in column 16.)
The comment field plays no role in the instruction's function

of directing the machine and may always be omitted.

A "symbol" (also referred to as a "location symbol" and
sometimes as a ''symbolic address'') is a string of one to
six non-blank characters, at least one of which is non-
numeric, and none of which is among the following set of

eight characters:

+ $
1
/ )
For example,
A A.l
1234X (12

are all legal symbols, Four '"types' of symbols are recog-
nized by the assembler, and each legitimate symbol will
be of one of those four types. A symbol is "absolute' if
it refers to a fixed-point number. A symbol is ''common"

if and only if it appears in the location field of a
