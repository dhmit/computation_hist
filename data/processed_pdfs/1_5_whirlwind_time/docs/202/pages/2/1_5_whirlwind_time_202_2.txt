THE OPTIMIZATION PROCESS IN THE CALCULATION OF ULTRASONIC DELAY LINES
Submitted by
Devid L. Arenberg

Ultrasonic Deley Lines have come into important applications
during the last decade as memory devices in radar systems and high
speed computers. In the former field, no other successful device has
yet been developed which will give the seme degree of stability and
linearity of response for the large storsge times and bandwidths
needed in moving target indicators and integrators.

The conditions of service for electronic devices in national
defense work requires that all components be of minimum size and
weight, so that a very difficult problem arises in the highly refined
ultrasonic delay line designs where one is required to fold the path
of a sound beam for a 1,000 usec delay line of over 12 feet within a
6 inch circle without eny deteriorstion of performance. Since the
path length is proportionsl to the delay time, while the volume of
materizl used is proportional to the square of the diameter of the
minimum cirecle in which a setisfactory design can be placed, the prob-
lem of obtaining an éptimum design becomes of extreme importance with
the longer delay times in the range of 3,000 microseconds, where with
present techniques a piece of stock over 16" diameter is needed. A
savingz of 15% in diameter is possible and would result in a weight
reduction of 32%.

Without going into the details concerning the method of designing
e, delay line or establishing the optimum relations, one can state that
a gystem of simultaneous linear equa-
tions can be set up which involves all
the dimensions and angles of the plane
figure used for g preliminery design,
and that these simultaneous equations
can be solved in a manner (0 improve
the performance.
