pool is one of the best-appointed in the East and an outstanding
building of its type.

ROCKWELL ATHLETIC CAGE ( Open from 7 a.m. lo 8:30 p.m. week-
days.) Although its primary use is for indoor athletic practice,

collegiate sailing had its start at M.I.'T., and the fleet is the
largest of its kind.

SPECIAL LABORATORIES A5 a center of research in

science and engineering, M.L.'T. has a great number of labora-
tories. In addition to those in general use, most of which are
open during regular Institute hours, there are more than 70
special laboratories. Some are open for inspection at stated
times, such as Open House and on the occasion of visits by cer-
tain groups. In general, however, because of the nature of the
equipment and the impossibility of interrupting many of their
operations, these laboratories are not open to the public. A few
of the more highly specialized are:

SUPERSONIC LABORATORY (Building 80) At the extreme end
of West Campus, this building contains the largest of the
Institute’s four supersonic wind-tunnels.

WRIGHT BROTHERS WIND TUNNEL (Building 17) Immediately
behind the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory which contains
two other wind tunnels, this is the Institute’s largest low-
speed tunnel.

COMBUSTION LABORATORY (Building 31, west) On the third
floor of this building are the new facilities for studying the
combustion of fuels in many types of applications including jets

and rockets. Many of these facilities are unequaled at any other
educational institution.

SLOAN AUTOMOTIVE LABORATORY (Building 31, east) Here is a
center of research on internal combustion engines.

HYAMS RADIATION LABORATORY (Building 28) In this small
building directly behind the Gas Turbine Laboratory the applica-

tion of high-voltage X-rays to cancer therapy and sterilization
of food and drugs is studied.

CYCLOTRON (Building 44) On the opposite side of Vassar Street
is the Institute’s cyclotron, one of the first in the country. It is in
continuous use, principally for the production of tracer elements
for medical and other researches.

HYDRODYNAMICS LABORATORY AND SHIP MODEL TOWING TANK
(Building 48) At the corner of Vassar and Main Streets is the
Institute’s latest facility for research in the mechanics of fluids.

OFFICE OF NAVAL RESEARCH ACCELERATOR (Building 58) Located
near the Swimming Pool is a unique structure housing the largest
of several Van de Graalf electrostatic generators in use at the
Institute. This has the highest energy rating of any similar
generator in the world.

SYNCHROTRON (Room 24-041) A 350-MEV accelerator of
electrons, the Synchrotron is used in nuclear studies.

WEATHER RADAR LABORATORY (Room 24-520)  Here storms
are tracked by radar as a means of studying and predicting
atmospheric phenomena.

SERVOMECHANISMS LABORATORY (Building 32) Research and
development of automatic controls for industrial production
and military systems are conducted here.

ACOUSTICS LABORATORY (Building 20F) This laboratory is
devoted to research on the properties of sound waves of all
frequencies in solids, liquids and gases; speech analysis and
synthesis; acoustic instrumentation; and acoustic design and
noise control.

DIGITAL COMPUTER LABORATORY (Barta Building, 211 Massa-
chusetts Avenue) A short distance up Massachusetts Avenue
is the center of research of one of the world’s largest high-speed
digital computers.

THE KARL TAYLOR COMPTON LABORATORIES (Building 26) Soon
to be erected, this will become the center for M.1.T.’s electronic

and nuclear research. Headquarters for these activities are now
located in Building 20-A and 20-B.

RESEARCH LABORATORY OF ELECTRONICS (Building 20-A) A
basic research center continuing the developments begun by
the famous Radiation Laboratory of M.1.'T. during World War I1.
