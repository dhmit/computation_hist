Dear Friends,

May we wish you all a very Merry Christmas and a
Happy New Year? We hope that 1957 was a prosperous
year for you and that 1958 will be even better.

We are about to celebrate our fourth Christmas in
the islands. We're both in good health and still
have our pretty little redwood house. More than that,
during the year we managed to make a number of im-
provements and even had our lanai slab poured. We
also acquired a better car.

During the year, Elaine took up water-coloring quite
seriously and we have one very presentable effort of
hers mounted above our piano in the living room.

In November a very welcomed event occurred. We re-
ceived a project from our old RAND friend Bob Davies
who is now on the Research Staff of the General Motors
Technical Center in Detroit. RAND has continued to
support us quite well but defense cutbacks have

Played havoc with the remainder of our prospects.

One business event of great importance occurred re-
cently. We were invited to make our Approximation
Newsletter a part of a semimonthly publication celled
Computing News. We can now say more than we used

to say and do so without the personal expense of
printing and mailing our own material. We recently
mailed out our last such business newsletter.

The sputniks came as quite a jolt and the daily news

has kept us from getting bored since. But who knows,

maybe we'll be around for a long time, Thus, our a
Korean daughter wrote to tell us that October 5 is

the birthday of her country:

"Our forefather set up our country this day 4290
years ago."

S50 you see, we're still young and have a long ways
to go.

Our very best to each and every one of you. Do write
To us once in a while.

Aloha,

Elaine and Cecil
