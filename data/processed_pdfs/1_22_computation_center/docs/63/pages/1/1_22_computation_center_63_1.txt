Support of Machine Programming Staff for the Utilization
of Electronic Computers in Social Science.

The Facility and its Potentlialities.
The high-speed computing facility, to be installed by

IBM at the new Computation Center at MIT will be the largest and

most flexible facility 1n this country to be devoted execlusilvely to
unalassified research and education. IBM will contribute more

than a fifth of a million a year 1n its support for maintenance

and operation. What 1s needed/in addition,to make thisjgie outstanding

tha Lo -
center for investigation ofqggggiéégggigéhine potentlalities in all

branches of scientific research, is about SlOO 000 a year for the
VV\W Aﬂ

support of a research staff, which can work with u&ess to develop
new and more effectlve techniques of machine utilization.

Arrangements have been made for all the colleges in
New England to participate in the use of the machines/and IBM has
set up funds for Assistantships to enable graduate students, at
MIT and at the participating Lﬁ%tasabéeﬁ& to spend time at the
Center, learning to use the equlpment. The installation is expected‘
to be completed by February 1957. Details of the installation and
of arrangementa with the participating colleges are given in Enclosures
B and € to this‘:&. This center and these arrangements represent
potentialities for new developments in soclal and physical science
of great and unexplored 1mportarce.

There will be no charge for eq&&pmﬁaz Cime, EEE students ¢t
@@ faculty of the participating institutions. Maintenance and the

routine aspects of operation will be taken care of by IBM, so that

those who know how to use such equipment can use it, without cost,
