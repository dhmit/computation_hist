IMPORTANT
PROPERTY NUMBERING - PROJECTS IN THE 7,000"E

Beginning with DIG Project Number 7,000, equipment
will have to carry the full DIC project number, followed
by the usual individunl number series.

For example, the first two items 01’ equipment acquired
on project number 7,125 will be numbered 7125-1 and 7125-2.

This is necessary because otherwise we could not die—

tinguish equipment in the 7,000 series from the 6,000 series.
