Professor P. M. Morse

Director, Computation Center
Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Dear Professor Morse:

I recently learned of the activities of
the M.I.T. Computation Center and should like to
request that Eastern Nazarene College be accepted
as a participating college.

Dr. Frank W, Gery, head of our Depart-
ment of Economics and Business Administration,
will be our institutional representative if this
relationship can be effected.

Sincerely yours,
