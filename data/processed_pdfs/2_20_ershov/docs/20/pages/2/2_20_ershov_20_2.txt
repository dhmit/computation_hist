the period from about August 15 through September 4, along with Kantorovich,
but the responsibility for outside those dates should be yours and M, I, T, 's.

Once an agreed upon schedule is available, we all three-UNC, Carnegie Tech,

schedule as soon as possible,

I plan to call you on Monday when you come back from Dallas, How are you
going to get him into Pittsburgh? (Go to Magnitorsk?)
