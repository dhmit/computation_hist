IMPORTANT
PROPERTY NUMBERING - PROJECTS IN THE 7,000“E

Beginning with DIG Project Number 7,000, equipment
will have to carry the full DIG project number, followed
by tam usual individuol number series.

For example, the first two items er equipment acquired
on project number 7,125 will be numbered 7125-1 and 7125-2°

This is necessary because otherwise we could not dis—

tinguish equipment in the 7,000 series from the 6,000 series.
