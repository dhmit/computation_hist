of inviting each of these directors, so that there probably
would be between 40 and 50 attending. The attendance would be
larger and probably more representative, of course, if all or
Parc of the travel eéxpenses of the conferees could be financed.
If this conference were To get out a report which could be used
by the various directors, present and prospective, and would be
avallable to NSF if so desired, then the editing, preparing and
Publication of this report would need to be financed. My letter
at present is just to see if NSF 1s likely to be interested in
such a conference, if they would be willing to finance some part
of 1t and, if so, what we j8hould do about it next. I will be
away in Europe during August and the first part of September so
L will not be on hand at the meeting mentioned in the enclosed
notice. If you have questions whieh should be brought up to
this meeting, I suggest you send them to Professor Freiberger,
in any case, I will be back by September 10 and would be glad to
hear your comments then or bef'ore I leave on August 5. I think

Yours,

Philip M. Morse
Director
