lelograms, Minkowski first conjectured, in effe.ect, tbat the minimum and mag;-
mum areas would occur at the symmelric positions, 1.e., when the parallelogram
has a vertex on the £ - (or 7 -) axis or on the line £ =0y (or £ = — ). We
shall prove this conjecture to be false, (see 4), for certain sma.ll ranges of p and
to be true, (see b), for sufficiently large values of p. Minkowski went on to make
the second conjecture that the minimum parallelogram will have a vertex on the
line§ = 0 (or & = — n) when p > 2, while it will have a vertex on the & - (or
n -) axis when 2 > p > 1. Mordell [3] verified both these conjectures in the case
p = 4, while Davis [1] disproved the second conjecture for values of p suffi-
ciently close to 1 and 2.

We shall also consider the question of when the symmetric parallelograms
provide relative maxima and minima, since this matter has bearing on the con-
Jectures when p is not large, and, in particular, it provides our proof that the
optima (and the critical lattices associated with them) do not necessarily par-
take of the obvious symmetries of the metric. This, of course, contradicts Min-
kowski’s first conjecture. Our main result, however, is a proof of Minkowski’s
first and second conjectures when p 1s sufficiently large.’

Thus, in principle, all of Minkowski’s conjectures can be resolved by solvin
equations (2) and (3) simultaneously for ¢ and 7 as functions of p. We shza.l{ir
ultimately do this, but only for p sufficiently large.

In the meantime, we take note of the tw
T=0,0 = 0pand r =

(3)

0 symmetric positions as given by
Tp, ¢ = 1, where

op = (2" — 1)
72 + 1 = 21 — Tp)

We first verify that if the base of the parallelogram is rotated from one of these
positions to the other, then each position, within symmetries, will be assumed by
one of the three vertices lying on the curve |£["+ [ n[” = L Infact, the base clearly
takes all slopes between 0 and 7p , the opposite vertex takes all slopes between
— g and — 1 while the included vertex takes all slopes between ¢, and 1/7, . |
By symmetry, these slopes cover all values between 0 and 1. Hence it is no
fundamental restriction to confine ¢ to the interval gp 2 ¢ 2 1, (or to make the

4)

corresponding restriction 0 < 7 < 7p . As for the size of these intervals, when p
goes from 1 to e, ¢, goes from 1 to 2, while  goes from 3 to 0. At the same
time, from simple convexity properties, Ay(s, 7) increases monotonically in p for
fixed ¢ and r with A(7,0) = %, Ag(Te 0)= 3V/3,and Ax(7, o) = 1, forall ¢ and 7.

3. Relative sizes of symmetry parallelograms

. 1f we substitute » = 0 and 7 = r,, we obtain the following areas correspond-
g to parallelograms whose base is a line of symmetry of the curve
