in the project back to the new generation of scholars via the
faculty teaching; the student members to contribute freshness of
point-of-view and to transmit the knowledge gained by the project
to industry and government when the students complete their gradu-
ate work and find Jjobs. / . :

The project as a whole will have an over-all supervisor,
presumably a senior member of the SIM staff, advised by a steering
committee of representatives of the varlous parts of the project.
Parts (2) and (3) will have heads and each case study group will
need a head. These directors should be Institute faculty members,
backed up by one or more full-time research associates. The rest
of the staff of the project would be other faculty members and
the research assistants. '

Funds will be needed for the salaries o6f the full-time
research associates, to reimburse the departments for the diversion
of part of the time of the faculty staff members from their usual
teaching duties to work for the project, and to pay the stipends
of the student research assistants. Travel money wust be avail-
able, a few secretaries and technicians will need to be hired and
some equipment must be bought each year, particularly for part (2).
Space must be found in the Institute for the project, some space
near the computation center, some space in the Sloan building and,
perhaps, a small amount elsewhere.
