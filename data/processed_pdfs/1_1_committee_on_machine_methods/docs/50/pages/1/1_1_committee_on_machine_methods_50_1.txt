Morse discussed the meeting last summer with Dr. Weyl
of O.N.R. and indicated that, unless O.N.R. were persuaded other-
wise, there would be a gradual reduction of budget for the project
over the next couple of years. Morse suggested that this should
be the subject of discussions at future meetings this year.

The parallel reduction in budget for the support of
Whirlwind activities was then brought up. The firast effect has
been to set up a system of charges for Whirlwind time, and all
users of Whirlwind have been requested to include auch charges on
budget® as soon as possible. Hevertheless, there will always be
a certain amount of research which cannot afford such changes,
and it is propomed that the Committee be used to judge whether a
project is important encugh toc be given Whirlwind time and whether
its need is such that the charges could be waived. Porter reported
on the gendral reactiom to this proposal (see appended letter).

Two requests were discusced: one for Professor Slater's project
for five hours a weesk; the other for Professor Shapiro's proJject
for three hours a week. It was decided to allocate an equivalent
block of time for these projects through the end of the firat term
- without charge but to warmn both projects that the situation would
have to be reappraised in January for the second term ard .that;

in the meantime, they should make efforts to obtain money for this
work.

Morse introducéd Rankin and indicated that he would
report later on activities of the project. It was decided to
. have the next meeting of the Committee on Wedneaday, the first of
: December, at 3:00 p.m.
