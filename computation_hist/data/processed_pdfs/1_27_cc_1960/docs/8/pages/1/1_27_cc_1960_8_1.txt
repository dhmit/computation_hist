M.I.T. computation Growth
by
Professor Herbert H. meager

M.I.T's needs for computation have already outgrown the
available capacity of the 70“. The underlying causes for
this disparity give every reason to expect that the situation
will worsen at an increasing rate in the future. The outward
manifestations of the situation are threefold: first, a queue
of programmers awaiting a chance to run their problems on the
70k has developed with a one to two day waiting time for
short runs; second, longer, more ambitious problems requiring
five to six hours or straight running time cannot be easily
fitted into the tight schedule and are thus discouraged;
thirdly, in an attempt to minimize the lengthening queue
which adversely affects programmer productivity as well asto
equitably divide up a fixed amount of machine time among re-
quests which are as of now approximately 30 per cent above
available time, the center has resorted to a system of pri-
orities and percentage cutbacks in time allocations. That
this is not healthy cannot be denied, but there appears to
be no long range solution other than to provide more computa-
tional capacity, both through improved equipment and more
efficient programming systems.

The available time of the M.I.T. Computation Center must,
of course, be shared with the other New England Colleges, widi
one shift of machine time nominally assigned to the other Uni—
versities. In the past, M.I.T. has been able to "spill over"
