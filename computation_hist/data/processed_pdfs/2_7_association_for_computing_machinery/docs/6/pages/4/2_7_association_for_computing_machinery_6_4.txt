In particular, the problem of atoning the ”ammo "lotions is

It is aasumed that the required spherical Bessel functions
to be generated to;- a given positive value of x and the integral

Straightforward considoratione show that the upward use or
the threo:tm recursion relations is numerically accurate for unﬁt)
and kn“). Inasmuch as these functions for order 0 and -1 are
essentially elementary trigonometric and exponential functions,
starting the upward process offers no problem. Conversely for x

 

 

not large compared to K downward recursion ie the only direction
numerically accurate for the functions Jn(x) and in(x). However,
instead of computing the function values for order N and Mel to start
the downward recursion, a special technique is used where the
recursion process is started at a higher order, A) , with the approxi-
nation 3‘) or 3,) equal to zero and 3‘) -1 or 33:1 equal to unity.
Here the barred quantities are the unnomalized functions. The value
of x) is chosen high enough so that the ratios of successive values
of 3n or in are accurate for all In less than or equal to N.
