Whirlwind I, an electronic digital computer at M.L.T., has been used to calculate accurately the optical
and electrical constants of thin metal films on nonabsorbing backings and of aluminum oxide films, and to
check approximate relations which may be conveniently used in the absence of a digital computer. The
conductance per square of film is found to be the principal physical property determining the behavior of
conducting films toward incident infrared radiation. The variation with wavelength is related to the finite
relaxation time of the free electrons and to imperfections in the films acting as condensers. In the visible
wavelength region the two sets of optical constants were evaluated for different thicknesses of gold deposits
and compared to optical constants previously reported.

ELECTRONIC DIGITAL COMPUTATION OF
OPTICAL CONSTANTS
I. Introduction

HE properties of thin metal films deposited on
thick nonabsorbing backings, are examined by
measuring the reflectance and transmission, by these
S ae T o RO S S S P e s S ST

films, of radiation nearly perpendicularly incident on
the film or on the backing. These properties are ex-
pressed by the index of refraction 7, the absorption
coefficient k, the conductivity o, and the permittivity e,
which are related to the reflection and transmission by
the following equations:!?
