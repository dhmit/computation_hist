Dear Corby:

In confirmation of our conversations thie past week, the operating
schedule of 709 time which we agreed to is as follows, effective April 1, 1961:

Monday - Thursday

7:30 a.m. = 9:30 a.m. IBM Customer Engineering
9:30 a.m. =~ 4:00 p.m. M.I.T. and N. E. Colleges
4:00 p.m. = 5:00 p.m. IBM

5:00 p.m. = 12 midnight M.I.T. and N.E. Colleges
12 midnight Â« 7:30 a.m! IBM

Friday
7:30 a.m. = 5 p.m. Same as above
5:00 p.m. = 10:00 p.m. M.I.T. and N.E. Colleges
10:00 p.m. = 12 midnight IBM |
12 midnight - 7:30 a.m. M.I.T. and N.E. Colleges

Naturally, exceptions and adjustments will occur. There were a few
~ commitments by me for the 10 ~ 12 p.m. time for IBM use, but I am sure

that these will be quite rare and I hope to adjust most of them to after
midnight.

Saturday and Sunday operation will continue to be extra operation
outside of normal maintenance coverage, but this time may be used by
youas needed to help to satisfy the needs of M.I.T. and the N.E. Colleges.

I hope this will give some relief to the delays and queues which
are building up, especially at this spring peak of demand.

jncergly yours,
3 IB !
