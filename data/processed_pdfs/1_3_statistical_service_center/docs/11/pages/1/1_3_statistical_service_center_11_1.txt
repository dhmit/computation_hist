Dear Dr. Stratton:

In accordance with your request, I have prepared & memo-
randum concerning the proposed space change for the Office of
Statistical Services. As I mentioned to you in our discussion, the

prime purpose for preparing this is to give you my thoughts on the
matter.

I also felt it advisable to indicate that I thought the
change may have certain adverse effects on the operating efficiency
of this office, particularly in connection with those services per-
formed for the Administrative offices. Should you therefore hear
of dissatisfaction from the Administrative Officers in the future,
you will understand some of the reasons.

I again wish to emphasigze the last statement of my report,
namely, that I understand your position in this matter and I certainly
shall make every effort to see that Statistical Services continues to

succeed.
S8incerely yours,
F. Â¥ Verzuh
Director
