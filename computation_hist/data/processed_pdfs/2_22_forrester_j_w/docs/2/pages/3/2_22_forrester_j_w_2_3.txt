Thus far, management education and
management practice have been com»
partmentalized into such classic
subdivisions as finance, marketing, pro-
duction, and accounting. However, the
major problems of the industrial manager
arise not so much from the separate
components of the company as from how
these interact to produce instability in
prices, production, employment, and
profits. Building on the development of
electronic computers, on military advances
in understanding decisionamaking and in
using simulation to solve complex sys-
tems, and on twenty years of researchein
feedback control systems, we may now
develop new ways to analyze the indus~
trial enterprise, Management is on the
verge of a major breakthrough in under-
standing how industrial company success
depends on the interaction between
flows of information (including policies
and decisions), materials, money, mane
power. and capital equipment. To help
provide a basis from which to understand
the forces causing industrial fluctuation,
growth, stability, and decline, the Mas-
sachusetts Institute of Technology
School of Industrial Management will
offer a two»week Special Summer
Program on Industrial Dynamics from
Monday, August 17, through Friday,
August 28, 1959.

Outline of Program

This Special Summer Program will
describe new methods of analyzing how
organizational structure, policies, decision
criteria, information distortion, and time
lags in information and material flow
may affect the course of industrial
growth, cause fluctuation in sales,
accentuate seasonal tendencies, and
amplify external economic conditions,
Models of industrial company operation
will be formulated for digital computer
solution.

This Special Summer Program results

uate teaching in the dynamics of eco~
nomic systems, company functions, and
corporate policies, and in programming
computers for industrial-dynamic analy-
ses. For a more complete description of
this approach and its results. see "lndus-
trial Dynamics—A Major Breakthrough
for Decision-Makers” by Professor Jay
W. Forrester in the July-August, 1958.
