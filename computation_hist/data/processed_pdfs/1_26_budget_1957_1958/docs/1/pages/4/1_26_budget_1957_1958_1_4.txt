REVISED BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR THE HIT COMPUTATION CENTER

 

-

1.0 Introduction

The purpose of this report is to prepare a2 revised estimate
of the budget requirements of the MIT Computation Center for the fiscal
period 1957-1958, This revised report is being prepared at the request
of Mr, Cusick, Comptroller, since the previously-submitted ''gray folder
budget‚Äù is reported inadequate,

On January 23, 1957, a preliminary budget estimate (memorandum
CC-11) was prepared and used as a basis for the above~mentioned budget
which was submitted to Professgor Floe., Since that time the Computation
Center has assumed physical form and the 704 computer is currently
being operated on a two-ghift basis. Accordingly, tho space on the first
and second floors of the Karl T, Compton laboratories have been oecupied
by the Center stalf, much of the office equipwent in this area has been
installed, and the Center is well on its way to assuming its final form.
As a result, succesding gections of this report contain a more-accurate
indication of the actusl cost required for budgeting purposes.
Specifically, a description is given of the estimated budget requirements,
a detsiled breakdown of the IBM machine complement in the Center, a
detailed breakdown of galaries and wages, an analysis of potential income
to the Center, a discussion of several rescearch projects -- National Science
Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, etec,, &nd some couments regarding the
method of cost allocation which is to be used in the Center, Finally, a
summarizing appendix provides an indication of the various contributions
made by the IBM Corporation.

Estimated Budget Requiresments for the Fiscal Period 1957-1958,

There are many expense items wiich are normally assocciated
with the operation of the Computation Center. O0f necessity, certain of
these expenses are one-time gharges, notably those associated with office
furniture, space modification, office equipment, etc., These are segregated
for purposes of clarification,

Table I summarizes the principal items of cost which may be
encountered in the Computation Center during the next fisal period.
Certain of these exponditures are fairly accurate because of their basic
character, On the other hand, other expenses are gsomewhat uncertain bscause
of the unforseen expenditures which may arise because of our occupancy of
new quarters, new installation and now "'modus operandi' associated with the
operation of the Center,
