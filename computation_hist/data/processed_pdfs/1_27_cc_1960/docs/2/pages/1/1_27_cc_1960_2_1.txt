Memorandum to: Dr. C. R. DeCarlo, Assistant General Manager,
Data Systems Division, IBM Corporation

From: Philip Mo Morse, Director, MIT Computation Center
Subject: Replacement of 70# by a 7090

Back ound: In June, 1957, somewhat less than three years
ago, an‘3§ﬁ§$5E"ies installed at the Computation Center by IBMs
under a special agreement whereby IBM maintains the equipment,
contributes toward amortizing the additions to the Compton Laboratory
which house the Center and supports a number of research assistants
and associates who assist users of the machine, and MIT provides
the staff and operates the Center for the use of MIT and other
cooperating New England colleges and universities. The primary
purpose of the arrangement is to enable students and faculty of
these institutions to learn how to use highaspeed computing machines
effectivelyg so that the next generation of scientists, engineers
and industrial executives will be able to exploit machine capabilities ==
in other wordsg the primary purpose is to demonstrate that such
machines are as important a part of the educational equipment of a
modern college as are chemistry laboratories” for example. A
secondary purpose is to foster research in the use of computing machinesy
particularly in those fields of application which have not yet been
explored or exploited fully”

To this end? priority on 704 time has been accorded to
regular class use by courses in machine programming and applications»
to students using the machine in their thesis research and to
research projects investigating new techniques of machine use“
Particular attention has been given to making it easy for the cute
oratown users: mail services special scheduling during visits and
Saturday operation for those who cannot come to Cambridge during
week daysu

Present Situation: This program has been outstandingly

successful: hence the present memorandum° Class use of the 704

has grown rapidly; at MIT there is now a freshman course in machine
usea four upperaclass and a number of graduate courses which use
time on the machinep in addition to the sequence of special coding
courses which are given by the Center staff during each term and
summero A number of other colleges bring some of their classes in
for one or more laboratory sessions. Class use will expand furtherg
