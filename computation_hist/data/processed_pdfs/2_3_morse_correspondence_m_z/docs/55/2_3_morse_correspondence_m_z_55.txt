Dear Professor Morse,

On behalf of the Tufts Chapter of
Sigma Xi I wish to thank you for your fine presentation
of ”The Use of High Speed Digital Computers” at the Tufts
Chapter meeting on this past Tuesday evening. I am sure
that we all have a better idea of what these digital
computers are and can do. I know nothing about math and
found your presentation both interesting and informative.
Thank you again.

Sincerely yours,

'w/Zietvro4nq,?ﬂgénizag,//
