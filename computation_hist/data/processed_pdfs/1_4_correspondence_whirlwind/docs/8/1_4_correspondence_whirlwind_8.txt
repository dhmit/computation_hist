Dear Professor Morse:

In following up on the subject of our telephone conversation of
last Friday, I find that the action taken on the proposed no-funds
extension of the numerical analysis contract task was a fully logical
consequence of incomplete internal communication here. It is our
intent to effect the extension and you may expect formal action to
accomplish it in the near future.

Sincerely yours,
