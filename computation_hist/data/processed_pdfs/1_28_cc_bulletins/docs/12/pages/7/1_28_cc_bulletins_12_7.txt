The fact that the conditional essembly governed by IFF applies to
only one following line of symbolic ceding is not a serious restriction, since
that line may be a call for a macro standing for a sequence of any desired length,

The Pscudo-operation EIC

Thig pseudo-operation has the effect of extending the variable field
of a HOP or MAC card, The string of cheracters on 2 card must be terminated
by $b, (where b derotes a blank) or by a $ sign in columm 72, to signal the
compiler that an ETC card follows, The compiler treats the variable field of
the ete card exactly as if it were an extension appended to the variable field
of the previous card in place of the terminating $. No break character is

assumed in the position of the $ sign: thus

MAC A, ,BCD
or
MAC A, ,B$
ETC CD
or
MAC A,$
ETC ,BCD

are equivalent; in esch example, the first argument is empty and the second
argument ig the symbol BCD,

If a generated variable field of amy instruction compiled by 8 HAC
call runs over column 72, an ETC card is sutomatically constructed, In
counting the range of IRP or IFF instructions ETC cards are not included - they
are regarded as part of the instruction to which they are attached, BETC cards
can meaningfully follow MOP, MAC, and ETC, Trouble awaits the programmer who
uses them elsevhere,

If generated ETC cards appear following any cards other than MOP ,
HAC, or ETC, then the lemgth of one or more substituted argument is too great
and will have to be reduced to get a valid assembly, After an IFF, genorated
ETC cards will not cause errors provided the three arguments required by
IFF fall entirely on the IFF card, This situation might arise if, ir order to
alter the original definition of a macro, two or three arguments were substi-
tuted into an IFF in the place of a single dummy argument: vis,,

MAC SAMPLE (EXPR, BCD1, BCD2)

in the above MAC call;, a long expression appeariang in the place of EXPR might
conceivably cause part of the original second and third arguments (now in the
fourth and £ifth positions amd hence ignored) to f£zll bheyond column 72 and
thus to gemerate an ETC card following the IFF card.

Created Sz@pols

If arguments are missing from the end of the argument list of a MAC
call, symbols will be created to £ill the vacancles, Symbols ,,001, 0002, ete,,
have been preempted for this purpose, A typical example of their use is in
the SKIP macro encountered before, where the symbol used for the dummy parameter
X need not concern the progremmer, The call
