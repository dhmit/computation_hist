more than one hundred scientists and engineers from ﬂew England
colleges will take the first step toward  using -the facilities of
the new M. I. T. Computation Center st e special twoeweek program
opening at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on August 20.

They wiII learn the principles of preparing problems to be :
solved by a modern high~speed computing naohine.v Their. study will
be in preparation for their use of the IBM type 70h Date Process-
.ing Machine, a large electronic computer, which will be installed
at H.I. T. later this year.

V The program will mark the opening of a cooperative venture
between IBM, M.I.T., and ___ other New England colleges to increase
the numbers of scientists and engineers qualified to use modern
computing machines, and to learn more about their application to
research problems in many fields.

Under special arrangements with the International Business
Machines Corporation, the type 70h computer will be operated at
M.I.T. to solve problems brought by research workers in a wide
variety of fields at the participating New England colleges. ,Those
attending the program beginning on August 20, according to Pro-
fessor Philip M. Morse of M.I.T., who directs the Computation
Center, will be those who expect to use the machine as soon as it
is available early in l957.

The two—week program will be given by nine members of the
N.I.T. staff, two representatives of International Business
Machines Corporation, and one faculty member from a participating
