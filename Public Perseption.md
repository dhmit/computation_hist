History of Computation at MIT, 1950-62

Finding articles writen by people detatched from the field proved difficult as knowledge of 
computers seems to have not reached the masses. However, the opinions of Academics where 
available in the forms of journals and books.

An F.B. Wood writes [The Social Responsibility of Scientists and Engineers](From <https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1457898s> 
). In piece, there is discussion on whether scientists should be held accountable for what comes 
from their creation. The writer concludes that 'a checking chart' could be used to help 
scientists make moral decisions in an algorithmic approach. He refers to an article named "Curse 
or blessing?" from a journal named 'Computers and Automation' published in 1958. This shows that 
in this time there was still uncertainty in the direction computers would take the world. Another
 book has also been published with a similar title: 'Automation, friend or foe?' by Robert 
 Hugh Macmillan continuing this theme.
 
 Another piece of writing on the subject of computers is titled 'Some Far-Out Thoughts on 
 Computers' by Orrin Clotworthy. He preducts that computers can be used for polling and political
  sciences. What is interesting is his certainty and conviction.
  
 >'I say "will" rather than "may" because it seems to me that this type of election analysis will
   be only the first faltering step by an infant quantified behavioral science that is going to 
   be forced on us for its upbringing like a doorstep baby--- and soon'  
 
 With hindsight we can see many of the predictions made in this text where indeed true. There was
  definitely a lot of hope anad excitement in the scientific community at this point.
