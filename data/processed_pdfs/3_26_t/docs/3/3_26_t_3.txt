Mr. William H.L.Mitchell IIT

Hartford, Connecticut

Dear Mr, Mitchell:

Professor Morse has shown me your recent letter to
him wherein you inquire about material dealing with
electronic computers.

This rapidly growing field already has such a large
amount of documentation that it is difficult to determine
exactly what would be pertinent to your needs. Consequently,
I am enclosing an introductory brochure used here at the
Center and in addition a bibliography which has been found
useful by persons anxious to learn more about modern
computers. In addition, I might mention:that the various
manufacturers including I.B.M. have instruction manuals
for their equipment which they will usually make avallable
to interested persons.

I hope this is of some assistance.

Sincerely,

/
F. J. Corbato
Assistant to the Director
I.B.M. Research Appointment Program
