PREFACE

: This memo describes the macro imstruction facilities that will
become available as part of standard MET SAP language, The body of the

Certain modifications made to BE SAP are 2lgo described, The section in the
BE report describing input and output of compressed macros (macro skeletons)
has been deleted, since these facilities will not initially be available in
Hi SAP, Sections giving examples of the use of macros for recursion and
symbol manipulation have been added. The section on. gymbol manipulation

has been taken from the memo "Cutline of Use of BAP Macro Imstructions for
Henipulating Symbolic Expressions", by M.D, Mellroy, The examples in
