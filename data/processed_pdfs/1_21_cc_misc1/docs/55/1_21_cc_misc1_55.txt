Dear Dr. Morse:

International Business Machines Corporation has recently completed |
the construction of new facilities for Research, Manufacturing and Education at
San Jose, California. In connection with the dedication of the Research Labora-
tory it has been decided to hold a conference on the topic, "Communication of
Scientific Information", all day May 26, and the morning of May 27. Attached is
a program of this seminar. The seminar will include invited papers covering
the categories of the definition of the communications problem, present state of

the art for the development of suitable devices, and topics of general information
theory.

I am very pleased to extend to you an invitation to attend this seminar.
We are making provision for our guests to lodge at Ricky's Motel the evenings
of May 25 and 26. At the conclusion of the seminar at noon May 27, you are also
invited to attend the dedication ceremonies of our new facilities, if you so choose.

In order that we may adequately plan for your comfort, will you please
advise us if it will be possible for you to attend, at approximately what time you

will arrive at Ricky's, and whether you care to stay for the plant dedication which
follows this scientific seminar.

Sincerely,

2 Fane
