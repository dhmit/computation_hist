Director

Computation Center

Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Cambridge 39, Massachusetts

Dear Sir:

I plan to be in the Boston area to attend the Operations
Research Society of America meeting on 15-17 May. I

would like to visit the Computation Center on 13 or 14 May,
or if that is inconvenient, 17 May. I am interested in
the general operation of the center, and in particular

the automatic programming system you are developing, your
experience with Fortran and Scat (especially with respect
to teaching these systems and ''debugging' programs

written in them), the chess-playing program, and opera-
tional gaming problems.

Sincerely yours,

ral 7. 3.7
