Dear Cuthbert:

This Vassar question is embarrassingl There are
quite a number of institutions which are just over the line.
I am very afraild that 1f we say yes to one we are automatically
saying yes to all of them. Where then are we to stop?

I Sarah Blanding wishes to have a few Vasgsar
students or faculty do a problem on the 704 once in & while
or attend one of our programming courses here, I am sure we
would be glad to make arrangements; but I rather feel that it
would not be appropriate to consider Vassar as one of our full-
fledged participating institutlons taking part in the assistante
ship or associateshilp program. This would potentially dilute
the program more than would be good for it.

Don't you think so?

Yours,

Philip M. Morse, Director
