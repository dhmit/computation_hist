6 North Michigen Avenue
Chicago 2, Illinois

Dear Mr. Bolger:

The 704 at M.I.T. has been installed expressly for
educational purposes. Consequently, we could not make
runs on this machine for your company. Some of the research
groups investigating machine use, however, may be interested
in talking with you about this problem end may be able to
give you other suggestions,

If you ean give me four or five days advance notice,
perhaps I ean arrange for a meeting with these people
while you are in Boston. A Wednesday or a Thursday would
probably be more convenient than other days of the weel.
If you are to be in Boston for a week or more, I suggest
you ecall Secretary, Miss Hill, at UNiversity 4-6900,
Extension 857 when you get in town and arrange with her for
an appointment.

Singerely,

Philip M. Morse
Director
