Subject: . Research Projects in Computing Techniques for the
Computation Center

Need for Research in Machine Techniques - A year from
now, with the installation of the IBM 70%, M.I.T. will have an
operating facility which will become an important tool to aid re-
gsearch in many fields of science and engineering. With the gener-
ous support from IBM, this equipwent will be available, free of
operating and maintenance charges, to those who are able to pro-
gram, test and run off their own computing problems. Many students
and some faculty members can (and should) spend the time needed to
learn about machine operation, to do their own coding and to super-
vise the running off of their own problems. . |

Bl If we are to keep up with the times in the computing
field, or if we wish to go beyond this and take the lead in some
aspects of the use of digital cowmputers in research, we must have,
in addition to the operating and maintenance staff provided by IBM,
a research group capable of investigating the mathematics and pro-
cedures of machine logic, capable of teaching courses in numerical
analysis and machine coding and capable of advising persons using
the. equipment as to best procedures in the analysis and coding of
thelir problems. A small group of this sort has been connected with
Whirlwind since its beginning. It has been to a large extent re-
sponsible for the great utility of Whirlwind in research at M.I.T.
and for the rapld advances in wachine logic which have made Whirl-
wind so versatile. To utilize the 704 effectively, we will need a
siwilar, but somewhat larger, research group, which can be formed
by taking over the Whirlwind group.and augmenting it.

 

| Tasks for Research Group - To make the Computation Center
a true center for research and instruction, it should have, in
addition to the operating and maintenance staff, a research group
having the following duties:

1. To carry on research in numerical analysis, in the
logic of coding and in the development of programming technigues.

2. To lnvestigate procedures for recording and processing
of large-quantity experimental data or operational records or other
information, and to develop programs for the statistical analysis
of such data and its display or presentation in quickly understandable
form.

5. To aid in instructing students and others in these
subjects, and to help supervise student research in these fields.
