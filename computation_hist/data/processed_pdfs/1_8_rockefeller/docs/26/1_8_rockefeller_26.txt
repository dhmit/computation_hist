Dear Dr. Buchanan:

I have been delaying answering your kind
letter of May 21 in order to see whether I could come
down to New York to talk to you about our plans.

One thing and another has interfered, however,
and now I have looming ahead of me the necessity of hav-
ing to go off to California for three weeks. I will be
back in Cambridge again the first part of August, however,
and would welcome a chance to talk things over.

If it is satisfactory with you, I will try to
call you the early part of the week of August 6 and at
that time will try to make a date to visit you in New
York. If you are going to be out of town that week,
perhaps you can leave a message when I can get in touch
with you later.

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse
Professor of Physics
