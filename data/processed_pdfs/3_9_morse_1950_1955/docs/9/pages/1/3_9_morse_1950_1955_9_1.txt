Bear Professor Morse:

in accordance with ocur telephone conversation, this is to
inform you of the several inguiries which I have received from various
mnembers of the I.B.M. Corporation concerning the possible cooperation
between I.B.M. and M.I.T. on our long range computational progra=m.

Apparently Br. Hurd has been ghing seriocus consideration to
this matter and has discussed it with several high echelon people
within I.B.K. 8Since our meeting on December 15th I have seen him
seversl times, and each time he inguires "'When will I.B.M. receive
the M.I.T. regquest? As & matter of fact, our intentions for re-
questing gratis equipment is generally known at the local office
level, and I have been asked by the locsl I.B.M. personnel when
action will be taken by M.I.T.

Yesterday while attending the Registrar's Conference at
the Sheraton Plaza, 1 had an interesting conversstion with
Mr. E. C. SBchroedel, who is with the Education Bepartment of the
I.B.M. Corporation, and this matter was again brought up by him,
The current acute manpower reguirements in the EBPM Tield were
discussed and seversl possibilitios were suggested. Because of the
nature of his comments, I will discuss these with you ai our next
meeting.

I hesitate to repeatedly bring up this matter; however,
it is costing us money and possibly personnel which would cause an
acute situation in the near future. The attached statement contains
some of the pertinent informaticn regarding our expenditures for the
special -purpose machines ~ - CPC and 604, and ] feel it will serve as
useful background material in our discussions.

Sincerely yours,
