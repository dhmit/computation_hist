SUBJECT: Continuation of Contract N50riO6001 (n.1.c. 63u5 and
6915)beyond current expiration date for the period
1 July 1955 through 50 June 1956

REFERENCE: 0.N.R. Contract N50r106001

In accordance with conversations with O.N.R. represen-
tatives in Washington and Boston, we recommend applying to 0.".3.
for an additional 330,000 to supplement expenditures of Projects
63k5 and 6915 for 1955-1956, so they may be continued at the
agreed-on level. Project 6915 will be tapered off next year. It
probably will have about $70,000 unexpended of funds already a110-
cated and its part of the budget will be about this amount, so no
more is needed for this part of the work. .

Project 65ﬂ5 (WW1 operation) will have an increased
budget next year of about $160,000, caused by the considerable
increase in the use of ““1 for pure research, by groups in all
Departments of the Institute. The increased cost of this increase
in aid to research work will be borne by instituting a system of
charges for machine time to those non-O.N.R. projects at M.I.T.
which can afford to help, in accordance with a procedure which has
been approved by O.N.R. It is estimated that the "income" from
these charges will be about $60,000 next year. In addition, about
370,000 will be left unexpended, of funds already allocated to
$335, by 30 June 1955. This leaves $30,000 to be requested in
new funds. The details of the combined budget for the two projects
