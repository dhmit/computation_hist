Dear Corby:

You asked me to set down some of the things that I thought the Center
might do to further the project on the implications of digital computers
for social science research, or rather the things that I expected or would
like to have seen as part of the project,

 

I would like to state again that what I put down is not to be taken
as criticism, My stay here has been extremely fruitful and it is only
as the situation has changed at Chapel Hill that I have been forced to
make & decision between costs and retumms,

 

In the first place, you notice that I refer to the project on The
Implications of Digital Computers for Social Science Research, Korbel,
Cohen, and I had assumed the existence of such a project from the news-
paper announcements of the grant., Here one gets no feeling of the exis-
tence of this as a projesct. No one who is regularly a part of the Center
feels involved in it, and those of us who have come in from the outside
are uncertain to whom to turn with requests for assistance, There is no
project director, and let me hasten to say that by project director I do
not mean someone who directs research, I simply mean someone who facili-
tates research by having the responsibility of listening to requests and,
wherever possible, providing for the research needs of those in the pro-
ject, whether the requests be for something as s'mple as a typewriter

or for funds to bring some particular specialist hal f-way across the
country for a two-day session on some particular topic., Preferably, such
a project director would be someone who is himself involved in this area
of research and who would accept administrative duties of the sort sug-
gested above not for additional pay but in order to further an area of
research in which he is interested., Such a person must have a certain

| amount of responsibility and authority and clearly specified channels of
| operation, It is probably unnecessary to add that Dr, Verzuh does not

| meet this need,

In addition to the social scientists here who are interested in
applying digital computers to their social science problems, I had expected
