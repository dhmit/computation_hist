Suggested catalog description for first course: Numerical Analysis I:

Theory and practice in polynomial approximation,
interpolation, numericsl differertlation, numerical integration,
and approximate solution of ordirary differential equations,
Including error snalysis, with perticular emphasis on methods
adaptable to digital computing mechines. Prevrequisite: M351

Tentative description of possible second course: Numerical Analysis II:

selected topies relative to applications of finite-
difference methods, and related rethods, to partial differential
equations, especially to second-order equations of elliptie,
parabolic, and hyperboliec type, with particular emphasis on
problems of convergence, stability, and error estimation.
Prerequisite: NA I, M39

Topics suitable for inclusinn in second gourse:

Inversion of matrices of high order (convergence of
iterative methods of various types). Convergence of iterative
difference methods applied %o elliptie differential equations;
error estimates; use of sub- and superhermonic functions on a
net; numerical methods applied teo conformal mapping and use of
orthogonal functions. Stability and convergence of difference-
equation approximations to linear and quasi-lineayr parabolic
equations. Convergence problems and use of characteristics in
connection with hyperbelic eqguations. "Rardom wall" problems
"Monte . Cario® methods.
