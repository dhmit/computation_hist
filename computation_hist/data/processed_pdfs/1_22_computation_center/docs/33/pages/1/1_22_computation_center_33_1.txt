Memorandum

Subject: Tape and Drum Post-Mortems in the Operator Program
by Sheldon Best and Frank Helwig

WM
The postamortem routine contained in the operator program

should be able to post-mortem tapes and drums. The following
abilities are proposed: |

1. Requests fbr~drum_post=m6rtems should be exactly
like core memory requests except for the mode designator
DR n ns=1,2,3,4
2. Requests for tape post-mortems should have the mode
designator
MT n ne 0,1,000,9
and should have an extra (fifth) address of the form
(REW) (FwD OR EOF,,E,OR E@F
BKW)(ElEl ) (Fa 0

where E. and E, denote expressions, The first three parts of
this address afie used to position the tapes:

(a) (REW) is optional and rewinds the tape.
(b) (FWD)(E OR EeF) specifies that the tape be
spaced (forward or backwards) ither E. records or to the nearest
end-of=-file gap (whichever oceurs firs%

The final section of this address specifies that elther
records be processed or that records be processed up to an
eÔ¨Ådaorefile gap (whichever occurs first). The words within the
record to be printed are specified by the first and second

addressed (as for regular core memory requests).

It is tentatively proposed that the recording of tags in
location fields be surpressed during tape and drum reqguests.
