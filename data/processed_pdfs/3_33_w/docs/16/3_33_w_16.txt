Mr, R.~ Ps Webber

M.I.T.

Dear Mr. Webber:

At a recent conference with Drs. Eckhardt, Seeger amd Cohen
of NSF, it was suggested that the first two pages of our proposal
to NSF, submitted last month, be modified to clarify the point
that this is a request for funds for research, not for support
of a facility. I enclose twenty copies of a new draft, which
you can send on to NSF, requesting that they substitute these
for the first two pages of their copies of our present proposal.

Yours,

Philip M. Morse
