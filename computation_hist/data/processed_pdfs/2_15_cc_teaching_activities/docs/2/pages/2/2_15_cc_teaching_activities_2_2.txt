should be in the range of $13,000 to $114,000 depending on qualifications.

At this time, we are also trying to fill both a senior and a junior
position in economics. The persons we are looking for should have a good
background in statistics and preferably some computer experience. Train—
ing in urban or regional economics is desirable but not essential. The
positions are continuing ones, the salary range for the senior position
being $10,000 - $12,000 per year, and for the junior position $8,000 —
$10,000 per year. The major problem areas in economics are the develop-
ment of several industry location models, an employment projection model,
and similar regional analyses.

We believe that these positions represent an outstanding opportunity
for competent and imaginative persons. I would appreciate any suggestions
you could make as to persons who might be interested in and qualified for
these positions.
