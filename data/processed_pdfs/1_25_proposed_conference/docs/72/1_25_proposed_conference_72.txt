Dear Professor Morris:

I must apologize for not writing to you sooner regarding the outcome of the
questionnaire I sent on budget and administrative matters connected with university
computing centers, I sent the questionnaire at the end of July and by the end of
September I had received 42 replies,

Even though this was a detailed questionnaire and included several matters
of a confidential nature, almost all of my replies have been very complete, I
therefore feel that I owe these people some concrete results for their effort, At
the present time I will relate to you some of the more obvious conclusions that I
can make, and I will attempt to write up a more detailed summary which can
possibly be used as a basis for discussion at our projected meeting,

The three most obvious conclusions are the following: There is unanimous
agreement on as open a shop as consist@nt with reasonably efficient use of the kind
of hardware that is available, In 40 cases out of 42 the center is supported at least
partly by general university funds, In only 5 cases is the computing center under
the administrative control of a department, In almost all of the other cases the chain
is from director to a vice-president of the university or a dean of faculties or a dean
of the graduate school,

I asked for a brief statement of the philosophy of the Director, The responses
to this were most interesting, some of them quite lengthy, A synthesis from all of the
questionnaires would go about like this: The Director is still trying to sell the com-
puting center as a university-wide research tool, In some of the more established
centers he has to take care that the routine uses of the equipment for statistics and
more obvious scientific calculations do not use up so much of the time that novel
applications are neglected, The usual answer to this problem is to encourage by
furnishing programming talent those problems which are novel and have no other
sponsorship, There is general agreement that trained people at all levels are much
more in need than is new equipment, although in many cases some new equipment
is quite desirable, There is further agreement that the computing center should
guard against becoming a service bureau in the sense of running routine problems
at the cost of exploring new areas, even if such a policy means a financial lost,

The problem of financing the center is a very serious one in many universities,
It seems to be a fairly general opinion that eventually universities should consider the
computing laboratory on about the same basis that it considers a library, but no place
has reached this admirable goal, Until that time, many universities which do not
have extensive research programs are finding it necessary to seek contract work
outside the university, and apparently some of this work is in direct competition with
commercial service bureaus, One university has gone to the extreme of paying full

rental for the equipment and subsidizing a relatively small academic program with a
large service bureau,

I would like to hear more regarding your further contacts with Dr, Grad, I
would also like to repeat my invitation that the meeting be held here at Norman, We
are served by the Oklahoma City Airport and our own univeristy airport and in addition
have good rail connections to Chicago, We are certainly about as central as one
could get, and we will have a brand new computation center building ready in about
two months, Although we will not have our copy of the Rice Computer finished by
Spring we will be well on our way and we can discuss our future plans, We are
rather isolated from the main stream of computer activity, and such a meeting
would certainly be of great help to us, The university administration here has been
very enthusiastic about building up a first rate computer program, and has com-
mitted a significant part of its resources (considering its limited budget) to the
program, Since our most desperate need is competent people, I am sure we could
make valuable contacts and get good suggestions from the group of directors,

Yours very sincerely,
