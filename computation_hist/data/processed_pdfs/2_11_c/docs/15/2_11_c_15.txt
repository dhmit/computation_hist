Thank you or your letter of June 25 Wherein you
of further details on the coding course whish will
be given here at M.I.T. this August.

Inasmuch as you already have éonsiderablsd familiarity
with the material which will be taught, it hardly seems
necessary that you disrupt your summer plans to attend the
course. The purpose of the course is to make it easier for
persons to absorb rapidly the Sewss amount of material which

is necessary for present day computers to be used effectively.
It appears to me that you have a dy essentially done this
in the two courses which you Fs ‘taken this last year at

Harvard.

Sometime after the Degtimitng ef your appointment at
your convenience you are expected to come to the Center and
get acquainted. I will be looking forward to meeting you

at that time. If you have any other questions concerning
your assistantship, please do not hesitate to write.

rE BrE IY,

F, J. Corbato
