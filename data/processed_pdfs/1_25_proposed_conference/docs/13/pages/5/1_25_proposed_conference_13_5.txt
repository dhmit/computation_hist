Though elementary computer coding is quickly taught, even to those with little
mathematics, the problems associated with exploiting fully the potentialities of present
znd projected computers are difficult and intellectually challenging, are demanding
the active participation of specialiste {rom a wide variety of fields and, in turn, are
stimulating new developments in many existing flelds. Experts in the field of computing
science are in very short supply; the shortage will remain acute until more colleges
train more of them., Graduate students, from several intellectual disciplines, can
profitably participate in this research, thereby improving their placement potential,
even in their initial discipline. Xnowledge already gained justifies the creation of
several undergraduate and graduate courses of instruction, and the granting of degrees

for studies in computer science.

RECOMMENDATIONS

From theee general conclusions, a number of more specific recommendations
and suggeotions arise as correlaries. The more specific the suggestion, the less
complete was the agreement among the conference participants, of course, because of
the wide variety of educational lastitutions and of machine instalictions which were
represented. Nevertheless, a large majority of conferses supported the fcllowing

A. Financing - A4 university or college should be able to support the basic
operatipg costs of its computing center from its operating funds, though it may need
epecial aid for the initial cost. Under some circumstances it may be advisable to sell
"second-shift time’’ to research projects (or nearby industrial orgenisations) which can
afford to pay; however, this sold time should never bLe more than half the total available

computing time and it must never interiere with the educational and unspongsored research

activities of the canter.

Some university computing ceaters recever a portion of their
