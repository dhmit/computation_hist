The title Geometric der Zahlen was introduced by Minkowski over
half a century ago. Its subject matter has naturally expanded
greatly, particularly in the last twenty years, and the author com-
mendably presents a more modern account of the subject. The aim of
the Enzyklopa'die is “to ﬁnd a middle road between the . . . historical
presentation and the . . . systematic presentation." The reviewer’s
impression is that the work tends to be more systematic than his-
torical, but the few isolated remarks that follow can in no way detract
from the debt owed to the author for his pioneering compilation.

One major pre—Minkowskian development is the study of the min-
ima of quadratic forms in n variables, elegantly interpreted as the
densest lattice packing of equal spheres in 71 dimensions. The dis-
covery, essentially, that the symmetric tetrahedral packing (with
n+1 mutually tangent spheres) is no longer densest when n = 4 is one
of the earliest indications that n-dimensional “Euclidean geometry”
would depend on n with “number-theoretic” irregularity. Strangely
enough, the footnote reference to this result (footnote 184a) does
not refer to its discovery (by Korkine and Zolatareﬂ in 1872) but
