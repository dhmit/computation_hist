Dear Professor lorses

In accordance with your request, I have examined the attached
request for proposal # PR&C No. RPA=l-65 which was recelved from the
Signal Corps Supply Agency, and I believe we are in no position %o
submit a proposal atthiis time.

There are severel reasons for thiss

1. The attached Request for Quotation is incomplete since
it does not contain any information regarding the techniocal
nature of the computations which are to be performed ==
no mathematical information is given.

 

2. Quite obviously this purchase request has merely been issued
to satisfy povermmental regulations; namely, the contractor
has a group in mind who intend to do the job and they are
merely releasing this request to make sure other bidders in
the field have had an opportunity to say noe

i
e

Since the proposal is required on Mey 9, there is obviously
insufficient time to take proper action on this.

4 The contravtor is very smpecific about the qualifications of
the personnel that are to be assigned to this task --
"Doctor of Mathemsties, Applied Physics or equivalent w=s"

Truthfully, there is inadequate information on this request for
me to lmow what the problem actuaslly is and I certainly don't think we
should consider it under the circumstancese.

Sincerely yours,

Fe Me Verzuh
