Dear Dr. Morse,

|
I enclose a first draft of a paper, "Electronic Computers |
and Research in the Social Sciences" which I am preparing

for the Social Science Research Council. This is the pro- |
ject Pen Herring told you about early this year.

\
I should i
like to have your reaction to the kind of material that
will go into this paper.

|
I will shortly be in touch with Frederick Mosteller to
arrange to spend a day in Boston to obtain his opinions.
I shall call you as soon as a date is under consideration,

to see if I can take advantage of your kind offer to dis-
cuss computers with you.

 

Sincerely,

= 2a gen

Ezra Glaser
