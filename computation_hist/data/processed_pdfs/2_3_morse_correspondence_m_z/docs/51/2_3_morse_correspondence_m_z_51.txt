Dear Dr. Curtis:

We have had Special Summer Pro rams on highâ€”
speed computer programming ana techniques In previous
summers. This summer all we will be putting on will be
a special course for our students and for those of other

New England colleges giving the details of how to
program problems for the I.B.M. 704.

We are not attempting anything further for this
summer because our new equipment is being installed, but
we certainly intend to put on one or more of the Special
Summer Programs you mention in the summer of 1958. If
you are still interested at that time we would be glad

to send you announcements.

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse
Director
