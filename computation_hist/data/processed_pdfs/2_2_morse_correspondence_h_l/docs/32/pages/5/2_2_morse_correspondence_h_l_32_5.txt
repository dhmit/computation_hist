T=T', but R=R'.

When K ,—0, these expressions reduce to the one-
layer formulas derived under III; when K WH<KK a<1,
the influence of the backing becomes negligible.

Case VI

Two adjacent absorbing layers.
Absorbing layer between z=—a and z=0.
Absorbing layer between z=0 and z=b. (See Fig. 5.)

The expressions under V are not limited to trans-
parent backings alone, but are also valid for two
adjacent absorbing layers. The numerical computations
are, however, greatly complicated by including a finite
absorption coefficient for the backing.

Summarizing,

Case I gives R,y and 70,

Case Il gives R(6), R'(6), and T'(f) for a plain
backing; for the averaging process sub-
stitute these into Eq. (9),

Case IV gives R,q and 7 'qy Riq and Ty,

Case V  gives R(6), R'(6), and T'(f) for a covered
backing ; for the averaging process sub-
stitute these into Eq. (9).

(B) Finite Range of Wavelengths in Source or
of Thicknesses in Backing, or Both

The following two cases are discussed:
(VII) Backing without metal film.

(VIIT) Backing with one surface covered by thin
metal film.

Intensity addition yields by substitution of Egs. (14)
and (15) into (1) and (2) Egs. (31) and (32):

R1= (n 1,—1)2/)1 1,2+1, (31)
Tr=2ny/n’+1. (32)

Equations (29) and (30) are identical, respectively
with Eqs. (31) and (32) when e=nm, where n is an,
integer.

When ez nm, the difference between Egs. (29) and
(30) on one hand, and (31) and (32) on the other is very
small when e is large (at least several times ). This

difference is usually negligible in comparison to experi-

mental error, as shown in Appendix II.

As indicated in the section on “Amplitude Addition”

of this discussion, it is necessary to average the expres-
sions for reflection and transmission for monochromatic
radiation and uniform backings over the phase angle

of the backing.

Backing without metal film.
For the uncovered backing substitute Eqgs. (16) and
(17) into Egs. (9) to produce Egs. (29) and (30):

For a thin absorbing film on a thick, nonabsorbing
backing the averaging procedure is applied as under VI,

Imaginary parts; each of these poles has a complex con-
Jugate pole in the lower half of the plane, and to each
