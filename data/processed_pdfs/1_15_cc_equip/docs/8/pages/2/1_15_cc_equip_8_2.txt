The above estimated costs were based on prices obtained for
Steclcase equipment. IEM Corporation is going to use General Fireproofing
equipment, so I imagine for reasons of compatibility we at MIT should also
buy General Fiveproofing equipment, This means thai our prices may be
increased by five per cent (5%) and occasionally by ten per cent (10%).

In any case, it is apparent that IBM is paying over half of the cost of
the above equipment in the MIT Computation Center.

Mamuyouhavehadmomrtunitytoemimthu, I would
appreciate hearing from you in order that we may initiate the necessary

purchase orders, etc., to procure this equipment, since (we hope) the ares
will be available in April.

Sincerely yours,

F. M. Verzuh
