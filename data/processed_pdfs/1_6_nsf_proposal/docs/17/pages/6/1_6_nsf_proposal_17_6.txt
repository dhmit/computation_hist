In the use of analogue computers, with conventional IBM equipment
and with Whirlwind I. His salary will be charged to the Project.

- Frank M. Verzuh, who will be assistant director for
operatlons of the new Center, will also assist the Project. As
Director of Statistical Services at MIT since 1946, he has been
connected with the operation of MIT computational work since 1940,
In this capacity he has had considerable experience with the
utilization of varilous analogue computing equipment--differential
anzlyzers, etc., as well as a complete line of digital machines
ranging from the IBM Type 601 through the Type TO4. He received
a B.S, degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of
Denver in 1940, a M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from MIT
in 1946, and a Se¢.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from MIT in
1952. None of his salary will be charged to the Project. g

- In addition, the members of the MIT Machine Computation
Committee and of the Computation Center's Advisory Committee on
the cooperative program of the Center (see Appendix A) will be’
available for advice and cooperation. From time to time, if one
- of them can supervise a part of the Project, part of his salary may
be charged to the Project. :

Full-Time Members of the Project
These will include some former members of the Vhirlwind

programming research group, such as Frank Eelwig and Sheldon Best,

and others. Some of the best of the IBM research assistants at the

Center will be taken on the Project, for appropriate periocds, at

full time, after they have finished thelr graduate work and relinquished
