SEQAP 1is an assembler for the 709 that recognizes

SEQ9
the pseudo-ops of UAGAPS-7 and all the machline instructlions
of ‘the 709; no operatlng system 1is I1lncluded. Debugged programs
and some of the large systems are probably more casily con-
verted to the 709 via SEQAP.
To convert, remove all MITAOP commands such as
PRG OFF, LST, PMR, etc. and replace the 704 input and output
instructions or subroutines with the comparable 709 routines.
Undebugged programs should probably not be converted
to SE9QAP since the use of the computer outside of a system 1is
time consuming: tape set-up and removal time is expended,
operator check-in.and check-out is necessary, and the aumps
are usually more-extensive than reguired since non-system

dumps are generally primitive.
