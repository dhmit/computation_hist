College or with m. horooe Pratt or the university or mine,
to m mthor there in a faculty neuter of cm or the other
of those institutions who would be willing to help you lay
out the work to:- machine calculation and could help set the
runs made hon. We have no coding staff, so tho faculty
member would have to help you with the ocdinls and would need
to come down here at least to sea tho problem through its
“debugging" stage.

We also cannot promise you nnlinitcd time on the 70M
28 other colleges are using the facilities and if your problem
