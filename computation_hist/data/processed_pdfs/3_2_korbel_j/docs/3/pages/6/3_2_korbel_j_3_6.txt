In February of each year, om the other hand, work experience
during the previous year is recorded and in March income and
the characteristics of the individual's family are recorded,
Last March, education was recorded for the first time,

2, Not only are the February and March questionnaires richer

individually, especially the questiomnaires of 1957, but
the informatiom on the three quarters of the sample which
persists between successive months is collated so that we
have work experiemce, education, and income as well as an
extended list of demographic variables for about 60,000
individuals 14 or over,

The fourth aspect of the investigation is the statistiecal
techanique to be used, This is to consist primarily of what is essentially
an analysis of variamce, though the actual computational procedure is a
form of multiple regressioa which does not assume linearity or additivity,
The procedure is being programmed for the IBM 704, Purther description
and an illustration are givem om pages 31-33 of the attached paper,
Professor Orcutt has consented to provide advice on statistical matters,

Because of the nom-disclosure regulations governing the Bureau of
the Census, it is not possible to obtaim copies of the 1957 Curremt Popula-
tion Survey tapes referred to abowve, However, the Bureau has indicated
willingness to pumnch cards from these tapes according to our specificatioans
and to cross classify these by various desired combinatioms of seven or
eight variebles, Simultaneous cross-classification by more tham this
number of variables would result in too many empty cells, The major
disadvantage of this limitation may be mitigated, however, by judiciously
selecting the combimations of variables so that those betweea which we
suspect sigaificaat interactiens may be treated simultaneously, In this
way we may aveid the necessity of assuming additivity of effects where
the assumption appears clearly unwarranted, It is hoped that the imves-
tigation of the data referred to on pages 22-27 of the attached paper,
which is currently underway, will throw some light on the relative significaace
