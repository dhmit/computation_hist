MIT CC 2/14/57

A few days ego you received a list of office equipment requirements
for the MIT CC. Pages nine through fifteen listed the equipment for
card storage, control panel storage. tape storage, etc. , in connection
with the actual 704 installation. The equipment was listed as Wright
Line equipment but may be substituted in terms of your standard
order. The requisition for this equipment has already been sent to
you.

The first eight pages of this report describe the desks. chairs, filing
cabinets, etc. It has been agreed upon that IBM will furnish the
following rooms which are port of the listing on page one:

FIRST FLOOR . BASEMENT FLOOR

 

153, 157 14. 069A
. 147, 151 15. 058
145

139

. 148, 150

152

. 160

156

.

Since the actual equipment for thoee rooms has been ordered , I shall
appreciate receiving a copy of the order so that we may inform MIT
of the equipment that is on order so that they may order matching
equipment for the other rooms if they so desire.

No change in the size of desk. should he made since,1n many cases.
these have been measured to fit the restricted wall space.

Let me know how we should order the photographic equipment listed
on page eight. Shotid this be ordered through your contacts in New York
or should it be ordered locally in Cambridge?
