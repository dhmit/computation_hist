Dear Dr, Blackburn:

_ i have just raceived a lettér from Dr, R, N, Johanson
dated June 24, concerning the hiring of an additional 704
- operator, ’

You must recall our recent discussicns concerning the
establishment of a third shift for the Center and in which I
informed you that I would have to hire additional pergonnel to
man the third shift for the New England Colleges., I'd like
very much to begin the third shift operation as soon as possible,
Obviocusly, I cannot do this without nacessary operating personnel,

¥ You undoubtedly recall the terms of our contract in
which we indicated that three operators may be hired for the
New England CBlleges "as soon as the work load justifies the need”,
I am hereby requesting that you consider our needs in this light
and advise me concerning the hiring of additional personnel on the

New England Machine Operator Account =- 27478,

I would appreciate‘hearing from you concerning this
matier at your earliest convenience -- perhaps, we can discuss it
at one of your forthcoming visits to MIT?

S8incerely yours,

F., M, Verzuh
