Subjects Susgpations-lnsptred by your January 3 Report on the
e Time-Sharing Project A' | |

1 £inally got around to reading your Jannary nepdrt on Ehg
time-sharing project. All your short range plans seem quite
feasible to me. - . T T .

However, I have some suggestions that might peduce the com-
plexity of the modifications to the 7090 that are required. The
programnming scheme is similar to that_oublined in your report,
2nd the idea, which avoids full boundary registers, occurred to
me after reading the report. y " qarp &

1. Mochine modifications. We add 2 node of operation,t-mode,
which can be entered and left by sultable inétruccionss It has
two submodes, g;land‘;g. When the machine is 1n t-mode, the high
_order bit of the memory address pegister 1s fixed to be either
1 or O according to the hi or 1o submode and eannot be changed by
instructions. Thus the program operates in high or low memory
regardless of how it is written. 1In addition, a speclal circult
foras the or of bits 2 thru 5 and traps if this has value O, This

and 2ll other traps turn off t-mode.

4096 words (2048 at the beginning of memory and 2048 in the middle)
<pe peserved for the cime~-sharing system. The rest of memory is
divided into two blocks of 14336 registers. AU any moment one of
these blocks is beling used by a user's program or by a compller
working for a user and the other is being swapped with disk file.

All programs except the time-sharing system are compiled

petween registers 2048 and 16383 but can aetually run either 1in
low or high memory secording to lo or nhi submode. The Ulime-
sharing system nandling all input-output and traps occuples
0-2047 and 16384-18431. Having i1t divided into two blocks is a
mild inconveneince but allows the trap condition to be & gimple
or circulb.
