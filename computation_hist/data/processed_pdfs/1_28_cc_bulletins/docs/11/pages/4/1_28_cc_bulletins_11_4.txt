of punched output and all output from PRINT or WRIIE AUTPUT TAPE
statements should be with the estimate of printed output,

The Interval Timer

The Center's 7090 includesé an interval storage clock and
interval timer, Because programming and integrating the use of
this device is fairly complex and because the Center feels. its
use should be standardized as much as possible, a routine MITMR
has been written and will be integrated into Version 2 of the
system., This routine will be used to stop jobs which are
exceeding their time estimates, It may be used by the programmer
in many ways to time sections of his program., CC-193, available
in Room 26-142, is a complete description and write-up of this
routine, Programs which exceed the maximum time estimate on
the I.D, card will be automatically terminated, without operator
intervention, When the maximum estimate is reached, (F2PM)
will be called automatically. At this time any (F2PM) request
cards will be processed, even though the maximum time has been
reached, and control will then be returned to the system,

FAP

A new version of FAP has been added to the FORTRAN Monitor

System, The following new pseudo-operations have been added
to FAP:

SDN
SDL
SDH
- RIC
RUN
The scope instructions WIVA and CFFA have been added to FAP also,

FMS Library Changes and Additions

(FPT). The subprogram (FPT), floating-point trap, has been
changed such that the subprogram MPVIE), rather than ERR@R, is
used for tracing., There is a resulting speed up in operation,
The error message now written on logical tape 2 should be of
more aid to a programmer. For a more detailed description, one
should obtain a one-page write=-up in Room 26-153.

SCOPE Routines. The following scope subroutines have been
added to the library tape:

1, AXISX, AXISY
2, ‘BRIPIC, DIMPIC
3. FRAME

4, SCID, SCID1
