Dear Manny:

I am afraid my May and June are so completely
filled up that I can't make your meeting in California.
I am sorry, because it looks like an interesting one
and I have been holding off writing you, hoping I could
rearrange things, but I can't.

However, I hope that John MacCarthy will get to
the meeting and I can hear from him what went on.

Sure hope you can come up this way some time.

Yours,

Philip M. Morse
Director
