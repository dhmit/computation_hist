COMMITTEE ON MACHINE METHODS OF COMPUTATION
Hinutes of the Third Meeting

January 12, 1955
Persons Present: S. H. Caldwell, S. D. Drell,
J. W. Forrester, F. B. Hildebrand,
P. M. Morse, J. D. Porter,
W. W., Seifert, G. B. Thomas, Jr.,
F. M. Verzuh

Morse reported the latest discussions with
ONR for support of Whirlwind and the assistantship pro-
gram for the academic year 1955-1956. The assistantship
program can continue at its present level until June 1956
without further funds. Morse suggested that this might
be an appropriate time to terminate such a general pPro-
gram and to go to specific programs for research assistant
support thenceforth.

Porter indicated that there were nearly enough
funds for Whirlwind support to keep it going until June
1956, if some of the large D.I.C. projects could add their
support for WW time used. After this date, however, it
might require another F200,000 to support WW for a fur-
ther year. Porter and Morse are to report to ONR.

Verzuh reported that the I.B.M. equipment is
to be moved to Building 20 sometime in the spring.

The next meeting of the Committee will be Tues-
day, February 15, at 2:00 p.m. The Committee will look
over the preliminary proposals for new assistants for
next year.
