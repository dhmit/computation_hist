Dear Mr, Carpenter:

Thank you for your letter of April 15 expressing interest in the program
that is going on at M. I. T. Actually, this facility is run by M. 1. T. and

it is under the direction of Professor Philip M. Morse. I would suggest that
you address any inquiries that you might have to Professor Morse, who I

am sure, will be delighted to supply you with full details,

Very truly yours,

MELVIN A. SHADER
