6. Alternative form of the reduction theorem. We hMEIShOWUihat
every basis is equivalent under change of basis to a reduced b21515, It .13 no
loss of generality to assume that the change of basis involves a mat,“ of
determinant +1 (as all basis vectors can be multiplied by _1 Wlthout
affecting the deﬁnition of reduction). Likewise we may assume by (4‘ 21)
that 13,, 3;, B3 are S, P, Q respectively. Finally we dIVide each 0:1 by a
constant so as to put the lattice in inhomogeneous form, whence bﬁ= 1.
Then calling 122.- = E), by = 7; we obtain the following result:

Let three non-collinear points (sum) of the projective (£4)-plane be

Note that in order to cope with our previous lattice restriction (that no

lattice vector have a zero component except the origin), we must extend the
. regions to the projective plane7 thus permitting division by zero.

7. Cyclic basis. A very important type of lattice is one with a cyclic
basis,

(7‘ 1) bn= at, where h'Ei+j(1no[13) (In : 1, 2, 3).

In this case the ternary form <1), as a function of the 171;, is invariant under
cyclic permutations, and conversely. Here the basis B). (j = 1, 2, 3), (in the
notation of 4) is reduced if and only if, of the four quantities a), 0527 “a:
‘ (1x + 052 + on), two are positive and two are negative,

(or manna. + a: + a.) < 0).

The above statement can be easily veriﬁed. We further note that the
hard case must be separated since the three numbers a1, a3, a; can otherwise be
arbitrarily close to one another and still satisfy the conditions ('7. 2). There—
fore, even it the set of 26 vectors above were extended to any ﬁnite set
however large, of the type 7931+ lng+rnjB3, it would still be possible
to choose the a.- so that of the four desired basis vectors P, Q, R, S, the
one (S) which is in the all + (or all —) octant would be the one for
which k,+ l,- + mj7é0, while the other three vectors would be such that
k, + l, + m]- = 0, contradicting condition (4. 21).

Fortunately, in many applications, the hard case simply does not occur.
For instance, for later reference, take

(7.3) ak=2exp(21rim/p), (h=112,3),

where p (E 1 mod 3) is a prime and m through a complete set of residues
of cubic character indicated by It. Here on + are + a3 =—1, and therefore
if the a: were all of one sign (as in (7. 2)), we should have ) amigo:a l g 1/27
in contradiction to the fact that a is an algebraic integer. Hence the lattice
given by ('7. 1) and ('7. 3), (determined by contraction of a cyclotomic ﬁeld),
has a reduced basis very close to the cyclic basis described here.

Finiteness.

8. Norms and discriminants. We now consider the case where the
xi. 3:2, as components in (4. 42) are the conjugates of three numbers spanning
it (totally real) cubic ﬁeld. We shall show that although the neighbor process,
for instance, produces a chain of 3 X 4 matrices (see 12 below), they are
strictly proportional to only a ﬁnite number of classes. Thus the ternary and
quaternary forms take on only a ﬁnite number of values.

As a preliminary step, multiply through the matrices so as to ma
