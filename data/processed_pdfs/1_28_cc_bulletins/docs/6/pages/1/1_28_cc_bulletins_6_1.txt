Subject: T09-7090 Program Conversion

Although the 709 and 7090 are in most respects
program compatible, there are some changes that you
should make to your 709 programs to insure proper,
operation on the T7090. Somewhat in order of importance,
these are described below,

FMS MAIN Subprograms

The internal interval timer and clock which we
will have on our 7090 uses location 7 as its trapping
location. This location has been the manual restart
entry point for F2PM and all Fortran main subprograms
compiled before November 1, 1961 and most FAP main
subprograms contain the five instruction sequence

CLA Ã©FPT)
STO
ST <k Y= 20
CLA (F2PM
STO T

or 1ts equivalent. The last instruction of this
sequence should be changed to

STO 36

where %6 1is an absolute non-relocatable decimal
address. If you are re-assembling a FAP main
subprogram the entire sequence may be replaced by

TSX $.SETUP, 4

which 1is what Fortran now compiles. .SETUP is a
library routine which performs the necessary
initialization of (FPT? and (F2PM). Since .SETUP
may be expanded or changed at at any time it is
suggested you always use the library tape version.
