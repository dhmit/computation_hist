How the results are put to work

trong and weak
When a company knows the s : .
traits of its personality, it is ready to decide which
traits to emphasize in its communications with

the public.

As a typical example of how helpful the results
can be, let us say that the Profile turns up a
low score in the “progressive” area—that people
think of the company as decidedly “old fashion_ed”
and “homespun.” This finding is checked against
the “progressive” score of a competitor, and
against the score for the ideal company in this
line of business. It is also checked against the
kind of company image that the president says
he would like people to have of his company.

If the company lags badly in all of these com-
parisons, corrective action is decided upon. Every-
one in the company is told that the company
wants to accentuate “progress” in all of its actions
and communications. Advertising and public re-
lations people in particular are told to emphasize
progress in every possible way.

For a company to change its actual personality or
to change its image in the public’s mind is, of
course, a very difficult task. But when all of the
people working for the company know exactly
which traits to emphasize, the image building
job can be accomplished sooner, more economi-
cally, and more effectively than ever before.

How much of an investment is necessary to
evaluate a company’s image?

One of the major advantages of the Company
Image Profile is the comparatively small invest-
ment needed to obtain the large number of per-
sonal judgments upon which the evaluation is
based. The comparatively low prices are due to
the fact that we specialize in company image
evaluations and, therefore, have systematized the
procedure for obtaining and reporting the large
number of individual judgments involved.
