Error Detection in SAP

The assembly program always records a binary version of the
symbolic program on the BINARY INPUT TAPE. It will, however, detect
certain questionable cases and tag the resulting binary programs as
bad, This tagging is of significance during the operation phase,

(1) Any assembly which causes the letters, U, M, P, or R,
to print on the left of the listing is tagged as bad,

(2) Any assembly not terminated by an END card is tagged as
bad,

(3) Any assembly involving the pseudo-operations, FUL or REL,
is tagged as bad,

(4) If an assembly contains TCD cards and if any of the sub-
decks which result are bad, then all of the subdecks which result are
tagged as bad,

The user should note that the appearance in a listing of the
letters, A, T, D, or Q is not sufficient to tag the program as bad,
Column Binary Decks
2 A modified version of the FORTRAN1 relocatable loader has been
included in the translation phase so that binary decks in column binary
form may be read from the RUN INPUT TAPE during translation time. This
program can load the following kinds-of cards.

(1) Absolute symbol table cards

(2) Absolute and relocatable information cards

(3) Absolute and relocatable transfer cards

(4) FORTRAN relocatable origin cards

(5) Octal correction cards

A column binary deck must be preceded by a BIN title card,

for example )
BIN M100-5-1

and terminated by a transfer card, The translation phase records the
