Dear Phil:

We are trying to evaluate matrix inversion programs and
have prepared the accompanying standard sample of matrices.

It would be interesting if you could find time to rum
through some of them using your favorite code.

If you can fit this in, I would appreciate it if you
could send a copy of any results both to Morris Newmanâ€˜and
to me (at Pasadena). Dr. Newman will send you a copy of our
results. So far the SEAC experiments are complete and we
are in the middle of the 704 one. Usually n was 28 but
sometimes 49.

All good wishes,

Yours sincerely,

John Todd
