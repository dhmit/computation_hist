Dear Professor Brown:

As indicated in my letter or November 5, 1952,
1 am now enclosing a revised description of the content

of the proposed subJect entitled Com utation b Punched-
Card Methods. 1 would like to recommena that is suﬁlect
be ofTered Huring the Fall Term 1953.

At the present time the Office of Statistical
Services does have a complete representation of IBM ma-
chines. In particular, the present availability of the
Card Programmed Calculator together with its genera1~
purpose plugboards enables one to set up problems in a
short time. Specifically, the instructions for a problem
may be written in less than an hour. Therefore this unit
is a most effective educational device. Furthermore, the
grant of a gratis installation consisting of an 024 Key
Punch, an 082 Electronic Sorter, and an 402 Tabulator will
permit extensive laboratory use of such machines on an
individual student basis.

Very truly yours,

F. M. Verzuh

P. S. I am also enclosing an outline of the content of the
above subject.
