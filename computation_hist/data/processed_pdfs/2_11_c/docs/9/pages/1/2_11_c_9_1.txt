Dear Professor Morse:

Professor Henyey of the University of California in
Berkeley has shown me g copy of Progress Report No. 1 of the
MIT Computation Center. We at the Radiation Laboratory are
interested in working with the campus in establishing a
computer center at the University of Californis in Berkeley
and to this end I think we would find it helpful to have a copy
of this progress report at the Radiation Laboratory for our
staff to review. Could you send us a copy?

Sincerely,

Bk L7
