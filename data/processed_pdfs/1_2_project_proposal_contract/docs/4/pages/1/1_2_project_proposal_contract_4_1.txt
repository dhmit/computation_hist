Subject: Proposal for Research and Training Project in Applied
. Mathematics, Using Large-Scale COmputing Equipment,

'Partimﬂ.arly Whirlwind

Vhirlwind Project has now reached a stage of development
vhere its potentialities can be utilized, together with the other
computing equipment at 'Technoldéy, in a coordinated research and
training program, of the sort anticipated by ONR during its several
years of support of the Project. Both the Institute and the Nevy ere
vitally interested in the use of large-scale computing devices for the
solution of sclentific and ehgineering prcblems, and for the promoticn
of training for students ;ntemsted in this field.

Of course a part of the tlme of Vhirlwind will be used for
the solution of a special Air Force problem, and i% 1s expected that
the Air Force will contrlibute an apprecsable part of the support of
| the Whirlwind Project, for the development of equipment and methods
for the sclution of this problem. Nevertheless, approximately half
the vorking time of the machine itself will be avallable for the funda-

mental program, mentioned above and outlined below.
