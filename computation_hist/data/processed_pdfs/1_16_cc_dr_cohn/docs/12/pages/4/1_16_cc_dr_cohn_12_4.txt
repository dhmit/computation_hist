(12, p. 265), (which dealt entirely with one-dimensional [/, /1 projections).
[t is as follows:
The necessary and sufficient condition that the module M have a stable noym is
that for Z a variable element of minimum absolute non-zero norm in I, the projec-
tions Ry, 5[2] or Ro,(2] each positively span a space of dim([l, 7] or 25 dimensions.

spanning a space must necessarily positively span the projection. The sufficiency
