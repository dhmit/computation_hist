APPENDIX B
SWEAR! OF FISCAL a-lARGES

It has been our desire to operate the EDA for others on a non-
loss, no-gain basis. To do this requires a credit of 8100 - 3120/de
for other work. We have also agreed to give up to 10% total time on thesis
or academic work free. The following is a summary or actual credits and
charges for non-Instrumentation Laboratory use:

1. Daring the period July 1950 - September 1950, we paid RDA
account no. 231+? $1732.15, based on the old method of charging,
even though we were paying two engineers and three machinists
for operation during this period. I believe that. the proper
charge should have been about $815. This estimate is based on
the time of Ira. Hogan, Hr. Goon, and one third of the time or
Mr. Versuh and Miss Tm for one month - we used the machine
21.5 days. ‘ -

2. Since October 1951, Stevens Institute of Technology has used the
machine a total of 36.5 days. I believe a credit of approximately
W should have been made to DIG 6783 (LL. Air Force account
nulber for RDA). 8p until now, we have been credited with only
$2610. Another point is that billed at 1005 industrial overhead
rate, the charge to Stevens would have contributed about $1500
to the Industrial fund.

3. Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratory
13 days of work done in January to March 1951
Desired credit $1500; actual credit ‘30.

h. Mechanical Engineering Dept. (Prof. Kaye and Dr. Tung)
31+ days - August - November 1951
Desired charge about $3700; actual credit $2610
This difficulty was our own fault. We received some free corr-
s'ultation from Prof. Kaye and the remainder was considered a
contribution to Dr. Tung's thesis.

5- Project Meteor
27 days - July - August 1950 - correctly charged by Instrumentation
Lab. requesting DIG to transfer all salaries and wages for this
month to Meteor.
Credit $2008.53 plus azz ($2850)

39 days - August — September 1952 - charges now in process of
clarification. No difficulty anticipated.

6. Mr. Verzuh
3h.5 days - thesis
