agreed that MIT would submit a proposal to ONR to amend con-
tract N50ri-6001, NR 048 097 to support, for a period of one
year from about November 1, 1952, oertaln research and analysis
activities currently being established at the Naval War College.

Specifically, the Naval War College hag established a
new department called the "Research and Analysis Department®.
It 18 the intent that this department shall support the NWC by
conduoting, supervising, and assisting with research and analy=-
gis, and by providing liaison with relevant research and analy-
gis aotivities.
