up to the 14 hours a day during which the machine w111A9§e¥e$3¥1¥§$
number of problems in economics are going to be put on the machine
by Professor Solow, of MIT, and by Professor Orcutt, at Harvard and,
as other research workers in the.social Sciences learn how to use
the quipment, other problems will be brought to the Center.
The Importance of Team Research.

But an instrumentality, by itself, cannot produce new
résearch. To make the important advances, which are possible with
a computer of the speed and flexibility of this, one needs a team of
research people, some of whom know the machine and some of whom
know the research field. To get exciting new possibilities beyond
the stage of a "gleam in the eye" we need, in addition to the machine,
a staff of experts in machine use, ready to team up with those .sesad
scientists ‘who believe the machine can help them but are not sure how,
so that, between them, they can translate the "gleam in the eye" into new
and important results.

In the long run, the various social scientists in New
England will probably learn.enough about machine operation to be
able to make the machlne useful to them. But it takes time to learn
to program a machine of this sizz}iand research workers in any field
are reluctant to take much time off to learn new techniques. 1In
addition, to get alsseodmbedy the most out of a computer, one shou'd
have more than a casual knowledge of the electronic details of its
operation. This combination of knowledge, of a social science and
of a computer, will probably be developed in our next generation
of research workers. But if we want to get started using computers
in Social science now we will have to use a team; a man who knows

the field plus a man who knows the machine.
