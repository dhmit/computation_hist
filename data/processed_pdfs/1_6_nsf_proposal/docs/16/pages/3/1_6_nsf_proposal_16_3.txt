S
research group, which will energize and take the lead in the re-
Search carried on at the Computation Center by students and staff
of MIT and the participating colleges. We 1list in Appendix some
of the specific research projects we are prepared to start on.

Other projects will develop naturally from these and from the
problems encountered by the other workers at the Computation
Center.

The project would not start at full strength. The 704 will
not be installed until January or February 1957, though analytic
work can be started before the machine is installed. The present
Whirlwind computing research group can be supported by the present
ONR contract until December 1956, but a few new staff members must
be brought in in September in order to get ready for the new machine
installation. We estimate that a total budget of 60,000 would
suffice for the next academic year, £90,000 for 1957-58 and g100,000
for 1958-59. At the beginning of 1959 the program should be re-
evaluated to determine needs beyond that time.

After conversations with the scientific directors and division
chiefs of ONR and NSF, we are requesting.financial support from
both agencies, an equal share from each. We believe the work can
be divided so that separate contracts can be written. Some of thé.
proposed tasks would be different, though some of the broader
fields of 1nvestigation would overlap. We would hope that we could
put out a comblined progress report. In some published papers,

credit could be given to one organization alone; in others, credit

would go to both. Bookkeeping would be somewhat more complicated,
