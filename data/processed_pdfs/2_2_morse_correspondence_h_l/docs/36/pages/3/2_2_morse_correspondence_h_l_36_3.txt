tions just referred to cannot be inverted, (R, 7') cannot be directly trans-
formed into the (n, k) plane. Since the method described in this section for
R and T is completely analogous to that for R’ and 7', no special mention
of R’ will be made here unless a distinction between R and R’ needs to be
stressed.

A pair of values of n and k, (ng, ko), is to be found which transforms into
(Ro, Th), a pair of observed values for reflectance and transmission. As
first estimate a point (n., k,) is chosen, which transforms into (R,, T,)
as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Since R, # Roand T, # Ty, (7., k.) is not the
desired point. A displacement (ny — n,, k¢ — k.) should be found in the
(n, k) plane corresponding to a displacement (Ry — R., T — T.) in the
(R, T) plane. An infinitesimal displacement (8R, 67) transforms into the
(n, k) plane according to the equations

The partial derivatives dR/on, dR/dk, 8T /dn, and 4T /dk can be obtained
analytically from (1), (2), (4), (5), (6), and (7). However, because of their
complexity and since they will only be used in the approximate equations
(10) and (11), it was decided to use the method outlined below.

The values of the partial derivatives are found approximately by trans-
forming three points in the (n, k) plane into corresponding points in the

(R, T') plane:
