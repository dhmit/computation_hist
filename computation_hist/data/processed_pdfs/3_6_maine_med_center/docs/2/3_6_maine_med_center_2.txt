Dear Dr. Neleon:

Me for eendm Ie nteriel on your problem. in
I indieated when you telephoned. we could help you only if
you can nine art-enumerate to have the work carried out an
pert or the research or a new England college. I meet you
get in touch either with Protease).- R. L. Korsen of Bowdoin
College or with ur. Horace Prett or the university or mine,
to see whether there in o feoulty nether of one or the other
of these institutions who would be willing to help you lay
out the work for neohine calculation and could help set the
runs undo here. We have no ending start, so the faculty
member would have to help you with the coding and would need
to come down here at. least to see the problem through its
“debugging" stage.

We also cannot promise you unlinked time on the 701”
28 other colleges ere using the facilities and if your problem
requires considerably more than a few hours or machine tile,
you may not be able to get it all done here.

I hope you can get someone in Bordoin or the University
of Maine interested enough to help you. and chat we will hear

from one school or the other, concerning your problem, sometime
this spring.
