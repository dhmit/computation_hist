Fortran/FAP Monitor System, Version 2

 

IBM has recently distributed a new version of the FMS system
called Version 2. Primarily, this is a cleaning-up of the old
version, however, several additional features, described below
have been introduced. This new version does not require any
changes in most presently running programs, but the introduction
of Version 2 will introduce several changes some of which assume
the use of the subprogram .SETUP by the main subprogram. This
will require recompiling or reassembling your main subprogram
if it does not presently call .SETUP (see VI ,SETUP below%.

The introduction of this new version of the system is being
delayed until the Center's staff can incorporate the changes
previously made to the old version and until we feel sure it has
been properly announced as via this Bulletin, Notices will be
posted within two weeks on the bulletin board stating when it
will go into effect. When Version 2 is operating, the Center will

no longer maintain the old version since IBM now considers it
obsolete.

I. FORTRAN

A new version of Fortran called FORTRAN II, Version 2, will
be incorporated into the new system, It's compilation time is
decreased and time estimates can be based on the formula

.2 + .004 (number of cards) = minutes.

II. The DEBUG Package

The FORTRAN Monitor System will inclucde a facility for
dynamic tracing during execution of FORTRAN programs. This
facility will not be available for MAD or FAP programs. For a
more detailed explanation, programmers should obtain SOURCE
