AMPLITUDE ADDITION

When radiation coming from a metal film on a backing
is examined, the portion of the plate covered by one
observation is sufficiently large that the thickness of
the backing may vary over this area. Moreover. the
source of the radiation may contain a finite rang,e of
wavelengths.

Since the reflection and transmission coefficients de-
pend on the thickness of the backing and on the

wavelength of the incident radiation, t.hfa experim.ental
observations represent average quantities covering a
range of wavelengths and thi.cknesses. i

The dependence of reflection and transmission of a
metal-covered backing on wavelength and on thickness
of the backing is expressible in terms of a parameter
9="2mns(b/N), where np=index of refraction of the
backing, b= thickness of the backing, and A=wave-
length, in vacuum, of incident radiation. In averaging
the reflection R(6) and transmission T(6) over 6, it is
necessary to know the weight to be given each value of
6. A distribution function f(6) is used to express these
weights; f(8) can be found when the relative intensities
of the different wavelengths of the source and also the
geometrical shape of the surfaces of the backing are
known.

The measured reflection and transmission are then
given by

R= f R(0)f(6)do; T= f T(6)f(6)d0. (3)

The types of backings considered are those that satisfy
both of the following conditions:

(a) The curvature of the surface is small everywhere.
(b) The angle between the surfaces of the backing 1S
small.

These conditions eliminate, for instance, ground glass,
but include all backings commonly used; when the
shape of their surfaces is completely known, the dis-
tribution function for thickness can be found with the
following definition:

sl/.(b) is the fraction of the total area under observa-
tion whose thickness has a value between b and

b+-db.

Correspondingly, a wavelength distribution function 18
defined :

(M) is the fraction of the incident radiation whose
wavelength lies between A and A-dA\.

Then the probability that a ray of wavelength l?et\veen

Since 8=2mny(b/\), there is an infinite number of
values of \ that give a certain value for 6, as long as each
value of A is coupled with a corresponding value
b= (6/2mns)\. The probability of one particular value
of 8 is obtained by integrating over A:

(f«p()\)fu[z(x/anb())dOd)\)

The denominator in the right-hand side of Eq. (6) serves
to normalize f(6), so that

f 7(8)do=1. (7)

In Appendix II four practical examples are worked
out, namely, combinations of monochromatic radiation
and radiation of constant intensity over a finite wave-
length range with uniform backings and backings of a
small wedge angle. f(8) is shown to be finite over a finite
range, and zero outside this range. The form of f(0)
given by Eq. (8) is used in the main body of this paper;
the effect of some deviations from this form is treated in
the appendix.

COMPUTATION OF REFLECTION AND
TRANSMISSION COEFFICIENTS

(A) Monochromatic Source, Uniform Backing

Systems with uniform, plane-parallel backings, ir-
radiated by a monochromatic source, offer no principal
problems, though the derivations of the coefficients are
complicated and tedious. The following cases are
treated :

(I) A semi-infinite nonabsorbing medium.

(IT) A nonabsorbing layer with plane-parallel sur-
faces.

(ITII) A thin, absorbing film without backing.

(IV) A thin, absorbing film on a semi-infinite, non-
absorbing backing.

(V) A thin, absorbing film on a nonabsorbing back-
ing with plane-parallel surfaces.

(VI) Two adjacent thin absorbing layers.

In any medium ‘“n”’ between plane, parallel surfaces,
solutions of Maxwell’s equations for the electric (En)

and magnetic (H,) vectors may be expressed as (see
Stratton?)

En=(Ent exp[iKnz]
+E,. exp[ —1K.z]) exp[ —iwt], (10)

H.=Z, (E " exp[iKnz]

where {= time, z= coordinate along direction of propaga-
tion. Here E,,* and E,.— are arbitrary constants for the
solutions of Maxwell’s equations, and represent the
amplitudes of two waves traveling in opposite directions
in the medium. K, has been defined variously as follows:

Km= am+‘i6m= (2'"'/)\) (nm+ lkm)

= (27/Nnn(14ikn), (12)
K,=ao,= (27/N)n., .

where no=index of refraction of air, n,+1k, is com-
monly called the “‘complex index of refraction,” and 7
is the index of refraction of the medium. k, and
have each been designated as the absorption coefficient
by different authors. Some authors make the distinction
that k. is the absorption index. In a nonabsorbing
medium, « and % are equal to zero.
The other quantities are defined as follows:

Z.=wu/Kn, \=wavelength in vacuum of the incident
light, w=angular frequency of the incident light, and
u=magnetic permeability of all media considered. We
define also

Z.,", ,,,+1=Zm/Z",+1=Km+1/K,,.. (13)

Then, if z=m represents a surface separating media
“m” and “m+1,” the boundary conditions required for
continuity of E and H may be written as follows (see
Stratton!) :

E. (at z=m)=E,;, (at z=m)
and

H.,, (at z=m)=Hpn;1 (at z=m).
