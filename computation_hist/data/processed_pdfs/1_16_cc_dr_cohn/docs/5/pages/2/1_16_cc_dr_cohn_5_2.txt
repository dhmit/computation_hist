The image of a flow under the mapping z; — u; is defined to be its hodograph. Iy
general, three-dimensional flows have three-dimensional hodographs, but not the ex-
émples in the following sections. Flows with one (two)—dimens.ional hodographs haye
been called simple (double) waves. The relevant properties of simple waves, discussed
in [3], will be summarized briefly. For some function u(2), u; = u;(x). Now (2.1) implies

aulu, = waul)® = (qq')’ (2.5)

where u] = du,/du. The hodograph is any curve obtainable from a Prandtl-Meyer epi-
cycloid by deforming its plane into a cone with vertex at u; = 0. To specify the curve
completely an additional equation and initial conditions are required. For example, ip
a swept Prandtl-Meyer flow the velocity component parallel to a fixed unit vector ),
must be constant, that is,

u;\;, = constant. (2.6)

In the physical space the prototype of the hodograph point w;(u), a surface p = constant
which also bears constant pressure, density, and entropy, is a plane normal to u/ . The
exact locations of the prototype planes in the physical space are as yet undetermined.
If all are forced to pass through a common point, the simple wave will be a conical flow.
Finally, note that a prototype plane is a characteristic surface, all of whose Mach cones
are congruent and have parallel axes.

Now let

Xa = Ia/‘lz(a = 1) 2); € = X3, W = Us (27)

Later it will also be convenient touse X = X, , Y = X, , u = u; , and v = u, . Note
that to a point (curve) in the X, X,-plane there corresponds in the z;-space a line through
(cone with vertex at) the origin. Consider a general conical flow with vertex at the

origin. Since u; = d¢/dz; are homogeneous of degree zero in the z, S, ¢ may be assumed
with no loss of generality to be homogeneous of degree one. Then for some &

and (2.1) becomes
