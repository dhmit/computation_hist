Dear Gordon:

Professor Horse left for Europe on the afternoon of
lay ninth, and I was nble to see him only briefly at a
conmittee meeting that morning. He did not hnve a chance
to write a letter. but I took notes on his comments, the
sense of which I reproduce below.

Of the people in the computer field with an adequate
reputation for the Job of heading up n large effort by
l.I.T. in establishing a central computing facility, Perlis
is the only one with the combination of reputation, techni-
cal ability and maturity for this kind of Job. loree would
hesitate to recommend say of the other major figures in the
field for this Job, and feels that if we don't get Perlis,
we should probably breed our own. [is evaluation of Perlis
is based on about three years of professional contnct.

 

Sincerely yours,

Peter Elias
