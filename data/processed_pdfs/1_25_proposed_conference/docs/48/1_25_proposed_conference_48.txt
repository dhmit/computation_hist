Professor Philip M. Morse, Director
Computation Center

Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Cambridge 39, Mass.

Dear Prof, Morse:

Walter Freiberger wrote me about the possibility of holding
the meeting of computing center directors in Pittsburgh, and I would
sincerely like to extend an invitation to the group to use the facilities
here at the University.

Last year Pitt purchased the Schenley Apartments, a lux-
urious apartment building adjacent to the Cathedral of Learning, and
set up one of the buildings exclusively to encourage use by university
groups for meetings and conferences,

It would house approximately 70 people, 3 to an apartment
(2 rooms with 3 beds, and one bath) at $4.75 per person per day.
There is a conference room in that apartment for 40 people,as well
as other conference rooms in the Cathedral. The rooms are avail-
able May 30 ~ June 2 inclusive,

I believe it would make appealing quarters since we would
essentially have all of the group together with no outside interference.
If anyone prefers to stay at a hotel, the Webster Hall is a convenient
5 minute walk. There is also a Motor Hotel across the street from
the Schenley.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help
make arrangements suitable for the group.

Sincerely,
13 el
William B. Kehl
