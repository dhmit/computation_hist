Dear Sir:

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology submits
herewlth a proposal for extension of the reference contract to
June 30, 1957 at an additional estimated cost of $20,960.00.

We understand that this proposdl has been the subject of discus-
glons between Professor P. M. Morse of MIT and Mr. A. J. Wise

of ONR-HIT, Dr. Carl F. Mukenhaupt of ONR-~-Boston, and Dr. F. J.
Weyl of ONR-Washington.

There Tollows a summary of expenditures and funds
remaining on the two projects, Whirlwind Operation and Machine
Methods of Computation, which are currently active under the
reference contract:

- Project #6345 (Whirlwind Operation) has an unexpended
balance of $97,000 as of November 30, 1955. The current expend-
itures are approximately $10,000 per month. The average "income"
received for Whirlwind usage is approximately $3,000 per month --
a net expenditure of $7,000 per month. If it is assumed that the
present level of income ($3,000 per month) ig maintained during
the nineteen-month period December 1, 1955 to June 30, 1957, a
minimum amount, assuming some tapering off, of $119,000 will be
required during this period. |

Project #6915 (Machine Methods of Computation) hag an
unexpended balance of $71,000 as of November 30, 1955. The current
expenditures are approximately $7,000 per month. If it assumed
that the present expendi tures remaln constant, there will be a
balance of epproximately $22,000 on June 30, 1956. In accordance
with our present plang for terminating the ONR support of this
project on June 30, 1956, there will be certain additional term-
inating expenditures. It is estimated that $7,000 will be
expended for termination pwposes.

This summary 1s based on estimates prepared by Prof-
egsor P. M. Morse.

Profesgor Morse further advises that the expected
arrival of an IBM Type 704 Electronic Data Processing Machine at
MIT about January 1, 1957 wlll create a definite need for addi-
tional funds--to finance the conversion of existing Whirlwind
programs to Type 704 programs.

| Under the proposed plan submitted herewith, Project
#6345 (Whirlwind Operation) would terminate on June 30, 1957.
The task order for this period would include the usual Vhirlwind
project activities:

1. Research in methods of numerical analysis and
the formulation of scientific problems for machine
solution, together with the training of personnel
in these methods.

2. Support of the Sclentiflc and Engineering Applica-
tions Group of Project Whirlwind so as to make the
computer useful and available for the above-mentioned
research.

In addition, 1t is proposed that the following task
order arising in connection with the Type 704 EDPFM be included:

3. The development of a sultable interpretive program
and associated coding techniques to permit effective
implementation of the Type 704 machine.

1% is anklolpased that a separate project will be set
up to handle the Type 704 utilization within the MIT Computation
Center, and a geparate request to the ONR for support of this work
will be made in the near future. In this respect certein
experienced programmers could be made avallable for transfer to

this new task as of January 1, 1957. This anticipated transfer

has been taken into account in the budget proposed for Project #6345.

The foregoing proposal does not take into consideration
termination costs which may be associated with the close out of
this contract and the possible disposition of the Vhirlwind Computer.
It is proposed to delay the submittal of any budget for this matter
until such time as disposition of the Whirlwind Computer is
determined.

The estimated budget for the period July 1, 1956 to
June 30, 1957 1s attached herewith as page 3.

Very truly yours,
