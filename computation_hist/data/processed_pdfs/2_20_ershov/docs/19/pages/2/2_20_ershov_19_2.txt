We would hope to malke plaas for you te talk to other American computer
mathematicians not enly at Chapel Hill and Cambridge, but also along your

itinerary from New York to Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill to Cambridge, Massachusetts,
and Cambridge back to New York.

A8 you will see from the eaclosed announcement of the Conference, we have
invited other computer scientists from Germany, ¥France, Switzerlind, and in
addition, Great Britain, to lecture. We feel that the meeting and the people
attending should be of interest to you and your collexgues. The leciures, of
tourse, arxe o come uader the agreement on exchange of persons between the
United States ond the Soviet Union; and it would be expected that a like number
of U. 8, computer scieutists would be invited to pay a similazr visit to the Soviet
Union, perhaps to give 2 similar series of lectures.

I would appreciate your conferring with Academiciana Lebedev and Dorodnitsin
and Professor Kantorovich about this possible trip, and would appreciate hearing
irona you as soon as pessible. I look forward personally to meeting you again.
Pleasec don't hesitate to reply in Russian. ‘

Sincerely yours,

@l CMNQ]:
