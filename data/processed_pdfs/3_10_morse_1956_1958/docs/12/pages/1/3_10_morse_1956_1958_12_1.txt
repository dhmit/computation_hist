Dear Prof. Morse:

I have discussed with Dr, C, R. DeCarlo the question of
helping defray some of the costs of semi annual reports from the
Computation Center. We would like to have your best estimate of all
the costs that would be involved.

We would particularly like this separate so that the
actual printing costs can be determined by the number of copies to
be printed. As soon as I have this information, I think we can reach
a decision on this matter.

Sincerely yours,

CAAAAANA A AN~
