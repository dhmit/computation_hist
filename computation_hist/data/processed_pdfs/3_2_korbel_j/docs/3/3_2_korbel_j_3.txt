Proposal for a Statistical Investigation of Labor Force Participation
and Mobility to be completed by September 30, 1958,

This request is for $23,805 to finance a study of the labor force
participation responses of individuals, The object would be to estimate
the probabilities that individuals would emter, remain in, depart from
or remain out of the labor force under various combimations of circum-
stances or inputs, The inputs to be considered would include the demos
graphic and economic characteristics of the individual and his family;
his past status with respect to labor force participation; aad certain
characteristics of his environment such as region, urbanization and the
state of labor demand,

These estimates would be used to implement the Momte Carlo type
simulation of the United States social-economic system proposed by orcutt,’
Such a simulation requires large numbers of parameters or sets of operating
characteristics describing the behavior of the imdividual decision-making
components of the system, These operating characteristics are the
probabilities of various types of response or outputs’ under various sets
of prior circumstances, stimuli or "imputs’,

Besides serving the Orcutt model, such a multivariate statistical
investigation would also have valuable by-products, Due to the simul taneous
action of the variables referred to above upon labor force participation and
turnover, it has beem extremely difficult to disentangle their influences,
Published tabulatioms relating to labor force participation and gross flows
into and out of the labor force have not been sufficiently crose-classified
to sustain the necessary statistical analysis, The funds being requested
would be used primarily for covering the expense of finer cross classifications
of Curremt Population Survey results tham have heretofore been carried out,
Multivariate statistical analysis applied to such cross-classifications
would isolate the several influences and their interactioms so as to
alleviate the necessity for coming to conclusioms such as the following:
"whether the well-educated woman who marries end has childrem is more or less

likely to be employed than the mother who has less education is mot known,"

There are four principal aspects of the imvestigatiom of the
behavior of individuals with respect to labor force participation, In
the first place, there is the problem of defining participation itself,
This is the problem of defining the outputs or dependent variables, The
following types of questions are involved, How many hours per week or
weeks in the year must am individual work or seek work ia order to qualify
as a labor force participant? What criteria should we adopt for deciding
whether an individual who is working part time or mo time is really seeking
full time employment, i,0,, whether he is a full or part time labor force
participant? What comstitutes "seeking" employment? Should we draw a line
between full and part time participatioam or should we recognize a continuous
gradation? Shall we defime participation on the basis of am instantaneous
state or a condition over am interval of time?

There being a considerable evolution and literature relating
to these definitiomal problems,’ we shall mot add to it, but merely adopt
the current definitions which seem to suit our needs and which will permit
us to make use of the most promising available data, An attempt will be
made, however, to recognize gradations of current attachment to the labor
force on the basis of hours worked per week *

The second aspect of the problem relates to the independent
variables or inputs, on the basis of which we shall seek to explain parti-
cipation and turnover, As has already been indicated, these will be
thought of as fallimg in the following categories:

1. Characteristics of the individual and his family

a, Demographic

b, Economic

¢, Bducatiomal

d, Past status with respect to the labor force

2, Characteristics of the individual's eanvironment

a, Regiom

b, Urbanization

¢, Industrial structure of the surrounding labor
market area

1 See pages 1-5 of the attached paper,

* Degree of attachment in the past, am explanatory variable, will be
recognized by comsidering the number of weeks worked during the
previous year, :

ee A ———


-3-

d., Level of industrial activity in the surrounding
labor market area,

Here again, the exact definitiom of variables will be influemced
by the definitions under which the most promising data was gathered, Thus,
for example, with regard to the definitiom of region, urbanization and
labor market areas, we shall adopt the categories and boundaries used by
the Census Bureau and the Department of Labor,’ With regard to ecomomic
characteristics, we may for example, adopt as a measure of mon-earmed wealth
“other” (than earned) income instead of assets simply because the former
and not the latter is reported im the most promising source of data, At
least at this preliminary stage, it would seem that the most efficiemt use
of resources could be made by studying pertinent variables as we find
them in the available data sources,

Of course, the initial decision with regard to pertimence
is based upon common knowledge and imtrospectiom, Thue whatever we can
find relating to age, race, marital status, children, and relatiomship to
head of family is obviously pertinent, After the statistical analysis, it
may be revealed that some of the variables or distinctions between intervals
on a variable are not significant and at that time we may drop variables or
consolidate intervals,

The past labor force status of individuals comstitutes ome of
the most troublesome of the independent variables because of its obvious
pertinence combined with the paucity of reasonably accessible data relating
to it, The probability that an individual will be in the laber force in
any givem month is obviously heavily dependent upoa whether or mot he
was ia the labor force last month, last year, or ever before, And yet,
unless the right questions about the past are asked, a single questicmmaire
tells us omly about the labor force status of an individual im relatiom to
his preseamt characteristics, Unfortunately, the right questioms have
seldom been asked, The Current Populatioam Surveys im their ammual work
experience supplements do ask about labor force participation during the
year prior, but the published results are too crudely cress-classified for
our purposes, Three quarters of the households in the Current Population

Survey sample are re-interviewed in successive months, 80 that there are
records on Univac tapes which could reveal the labor force participatioa
of individuals over time, However, the information for aay simgle imdi-
vidual is scattered om many tapes so that extemsive and expeamsive collating
would be required to collect the informatiom into usable form,

There is the continuous work history sample of the BOASI; but
only OASI covered employment is recorded and the demographic amd economic
characterizations of individuals are very sketchy?

Somewhat more promising, but still hardly adequate for our
purposes, is the basic data umderlying the SSRC study, Labor Mobility im
Six Cities, This comsists of interviews with a probability sample of 4400
women and 8543 men, In order to qualify as respondemts, the individuals
had to be 23 or over in 1951, had to be at work im January of that year,
and had to have worked at least ome month in the decade 1940 to 19850,

The trouble with this data is threefold, In the first place, it is biased
because those who were not at work ia January 1951 are excluded, In the
second place, rather few of the demographic and economic characteristics

that we are iaterested in were recorded, And fimally, there is mo repre-

 

sentatioma of individuals living outside of six of the largest metropolitaa
areas, It would seem then that the following strong cemclusiom of Jaffe
and Stewart is still essentially valid; "many persons emter amd withdraw
from the labor force several times during the course of a lifetime, The
requisite data for investigating this problem are mot available,”

Were it mot for the need to study the behavior of imdividual
decision-making units, we might rest content with estimating the propor-
tioms of individuals of given characteristics who are in the labor force
under givea circumstances, This, however, would neglect the rate of turmover
within cells from moath to month and we know that there are eomsiderable
variaticas ia this between cells, In the case of some types of imdividuals,
such as adult males, those who are in the labor force during any givea

month are much the same individuals as were ia the labor force the

month prior whereas im the case of married females with childrem, a ceasider-
able proportiea of those whe are im the labor force in any givem moath
were mot in the labor force the moath before, Unless we form estimates of
this rate of labor force turnover withiam cells, we may fail te allocate
labor force participatioa to the members of each cell with aay approxima-
tioa to reelism, Thus we cannot escape the necessity of studyiag the re-
lationship betweea present labor force participation and previcus laber
force participatioca or, ia other words, the autocorrelatiom of labor force
participation over time, Umfortumately, about all that the available
data allows us to de in this respect is to relate present participation

to participation during the previous pear,

The comsideratioan of iadependent variables has led into the third
major aspect of the imvestigatioa, mamely data requirements amd availability,
Ideally, what we require is access to observaticas on a sample of iadividuals
over an extemded pericd of time, This means access to the astual questiomamnaire
forms or something very close to that, Published, tabulated, cross-

 

classifications can mever be extemsive emough to sustain the multivariate
statistical analysis required, mor is it likely that published tabulations

will involve the partiemlar variables that are of interest to ws, Unfeortumate-
ly, most of the observations of the type we need are made by the Geverament,
vhich is bound by laws prohibitimg disclosure of information relating to
individuals, However, there are ways of providing the necessary cbeervatioms
vithout identifying individuals and we are curreatly exploring these possi-
bilities with the Bureau of the Census,

The best source of data comsists of two sets of Univae tapes, based
on the February and March 1957 Current Populatioa Surveys, om which are re-
corded, respectively, the characteristics of individuals and of families,
These tapes are umusually valuable for our purposes for the following reasoas,

1, The February and March Curreat Population Survey questionnaires

each coatain an extended list of guestioms, During other
months of the year, the imdividual schedules permit classifi-
cation canly om the following five variables of imterest:

a, Bex

b. Age


¢., Race

d, Relatiomship to household head

e, Marital status
In February of each year, om the other hand, work experience
during the previous year is recorded and in March income and
the characteristics of the individual's family are recorded,
Last March, education was recorded for the first time,

2, Not only are the February and March questionnaires richer

individually, especially the questionnaires of 1957, but
the information on the three quarters of the sample which
persists between successive months is collated so that we
have work experiemce, education, and income as well as an
extended list of demographic variables for about 60,000
individuals 14 or over,

The fourth aspect of the investigation is the statistical
technique to be used, This is to consist primarily of what is essentially
an analysis of variance, though the actual computational procedure is a
form of multiple regressioa which does not assume linearity or additivity,
The procedure is being programmed for the IBM 704, Purther description
and an illustration are givem om pages 31-33 of the attached paper,
Professor Orcutt has consented to provide advice on statistical matters,

Because of the nom-disclosure regulations governing the Bureau of
the Census, it is not possible to obtain copies of the 1957 Curremt Popula-
tion Survey tapes referred to above, However, the Bureau has indicated
willingness to punch cards from these tapes according to our specifications
and to cross classify these by various desired combinatioms of seven or
eight variebles, Simultaneous cross-classification by more tham this
number of variables would result in too many empty cells, The major
disadvantage of this limitation may be mitigated, however, by judiciously
selecting the combimations of variables so that those betweea which we
suspect sigaificaat interactiens may be treated simultaneously, In this
way we may aveid the necessity of assuming additivity of effects where
the assumption appears clearly unwarranted, It is hoped that the imves-
tigation of the data referred to on pages 22-27 of the attached paper,
which is curreatly underway, will throw some light on the relative significance


=o

of the interactions between some of the explanatory variables we shall be

working with,

The Bureau of the Census has indicated that it will cost $15,000 to
punch the necessary cards from the CPS tapes, to perform the desired sortings
of these cards and to punch the summary cards which we would use as our
primary data input,

The IBM 704 machine time that will be used for carrying out the
statistical analysis at the MIT Computation Center will not cost anything,

The total request is for $23,805, The itemization of this amount is
as follows:

 

Card punching and sorting by the Bureau of the Census $15,000
Half time salary January through June, 1958 1,500
Full time salary July, August, and September, 1958 1,500
Typing, card punching, programming assistance,
clerical help, etc, 2,000
Traveling expenses for trips to the Bureau of the
Census, etc, 700
$20,700
Allowance for indirect and special expenses 3,108
TOTAL $23,805

The work would be completed and the final report submitted by the
end of September, 1938,
