Miss Grace Kohn April 21, 1958

The salary connected with such a position would be at our regular
D.S5.R. (Division of Sponsored Research) scale, which gives a minimum
figure of $450 a month for a person with a master's degree, working full
time, so that you could expect something of this order of magnitude.

 

Before making anything in the nature of a definite offer, 1 feel | A Ro

that it would be desirable to have an interview. We should be glad to pay
your expenses for a day's visit to M.I. T. at some convenient time, if you
feel that you can make it. Also we should like to have a letter of recom-

mendation from Professor Thomas. If you are interested in the possibility, % os

could you ask him to send such a letter? %

Sincerely yours,

John C. Slater
