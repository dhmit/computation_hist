put on the machine by Professor 5010!, of MIT, and by Professor
Orcutt, at Harvard and, as other research workers in the social
sciences learn how to use the equipment, other problems will be
brought to the Center.

m Importance 23: Egg Research ,

But an instrumentality, by itself, cannot produce new
research. To make the important advances, which are possible
with a computer of the speed and flexibility of this, one needs a
team or research people, some of whom know the machine and some
of whom know the research field. To get exciting new possibilities
beyond the stage or a “gleam in the eye" we need, in addition to
the machine, a staff of experts in machine use, ready to team up
with those scientists who believe the machine can help them but
are not sure how, so that, between them, they can translate the
"gleam inthe eye" into new and important results.

In the long run, the various social scientists in New
England will probably learn enough about machine operation to be
able to make the machine useful to them. But it takes time to
learn to program a machine of this size, and research workers in
any field are reluctant to take much time off to learn new tech-
niques. In addition, to get the most out of a computer, one
should have more than a casual knowledge of the electronic details
of its operation. This combination of knowledge, of a social

science and of a computer, will probably be developed in our next
