6. TInvestigation of new technliques and applications of
linear programming, including procedures analogous to the methods
of steepest descent developed by Hestenes and Stiefel for the
solution of linear equations,

7. Computations of interest in pure mathematics:

(a) Character table of selected characters of the
symmetric group.

(b) Checking congruences of interest in algebrailc
number theory.

(Â¢) Further extension of factor tables and prime
number lists past 1012 via the sieve of Erastosthenes,
utilizing, say, Corbato's new factoring program.

(d) Coding of Tarskl's decision method for elementary
algebra and gecmetry. Tarskil has shown that ele-
mentary algebra and geometry can be decided by a
computer. To implement this would be a task of
considerable magnitude, but 1% would illustrate the
logical capabilities of a computer to a degree not
heretofore done.

8. Techniques for achieving fully avbomatic computer .
operation and logging. These will be investigated as an integral
part of the computing system.
