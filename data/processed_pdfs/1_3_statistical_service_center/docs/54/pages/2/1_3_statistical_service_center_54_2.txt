o IRy T TR &

The purpose of this memorandum ig to present & rate =
structure for the Card Programmed Calculator which evelved
88 & consequence of our meeting on Uctober 22, 1953, It
is proposed that this rate structure be effective for the
pericd July 1, 1853 until further notice,

Although a numﬁor“%fjdﬁifﬁi!ng plans were discussed,
the following recommendations were made at this meeting:

1.) The monthly machine rental charges for the CFC
(including two 941 units, and two auxiliary
machines) is $2400, Thig figure is the primary
shift charge and it includes a 20X educational
discount granted by the IBM Corporation.

Z.) The monthly coel of §R400 is to be recovered by
assessing a charge of $15 per hour for each hour
" of scheduled machine use., (it is believed that
a charge for scheduled hours will minimize the
"lost ® CPC machine time and, hence, increase
overaltoperating‘offtcicncys. \

3:) The method of cost a2llecaticon i{s intended to
assess CPFC malntenance costls to the particular
user’ scheduled to use the machine &t the time
it "bresks down®, Operaticnal experience during
the past 10 months reveals that as much as %8
hours per month msy be required for TEST, SERVICE,
and FREVERTATIVE Maintenance of the C¥FC,

a) Net average DAYSFIFT hours = 160-28 = 132 hrs,/month
b) Minfmum No, of usage hours required to recover
.. cost = 160 hrs./month, 1.8. 16C hr, x §15 = §2400,
