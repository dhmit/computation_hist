Dear Leon:
In accordance with our telephone conversation
I enclose fifteen additional copies of our proposal for
extension of our machine project here. I have been

assured by our Division of Sponsored Research that the

 

official proposal will be transmitted to the Foundation
shortly. I hope to see you in a couple or weeks.

Yours,
