The consensus of opinion seems to be that luncheon on

Tuesday, March 12, is the best time for the organizational
meeting of the Advisory Council on Machine Applications in

the Social Sciences. Accordingly, we will meet at 12.05 pan.
at the 14.1.12 Faculty Club on the Sixth Floor of the Sloan

Building, 50 Memorial Drive. The particular dining room
will be in my name on the bulletin board directly opposite

the elevators. I hope to see you there then.
