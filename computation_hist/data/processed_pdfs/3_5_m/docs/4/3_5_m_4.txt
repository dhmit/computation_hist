Dear Don:

Last fall, when I saw you, you said the Social
Science Research Council, and perhaps some other organiza—
tions with which you are connected, were begining to be
interested in the application of computing machines to
social science studies. I am sending you under separate
cover a copy or our latest Progress Report on work at the
Computation Center here. I think you will be interested in
the reports by Cohen of Mosteller‘s group and by a number
of reports on machine simulation of economic and social
activities. You said at the time that there might be a
possibility of some young man in the field wanting to spend
a year or two here at the Center learning machine techniques
and doing research in his field of social science using
these techniques, and I told you that the Center might be
able to help support such people while they are here.

We are not engaged in laying plans for the next
academic year. If there are any people you know of who
might be interested in coming here with such cooperative
support, I would appreciate hearing about them before our
budget is completely laid out.

We have made several beginnings in what seem to
me to be very promising directions and I think the right man
would get a great deal of good out of a year or two here.

If you are going to be in Boston in the near future I would
be glad to talk over these matters in more detail.

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse
Director
