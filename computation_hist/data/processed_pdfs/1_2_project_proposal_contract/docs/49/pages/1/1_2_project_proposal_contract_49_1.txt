Subject: Extension of Contract NSOri 06001

I am enclosing a draft of the proposed contract extension.
If you approve, please telephone me, and I will have ditto prepared.
I will then send you six copies for forwarding to the DIG Office.

Mr. Ryder in the BIG Office says that such proposals now
require approvals of heads of departments and deans. Since both
Physics and Electrical Engineering are involved, Ryder will secure

the necessary approvals.
