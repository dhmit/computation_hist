Lemma 18.3. Any two meighboring Minkowskian bases each overlap
overlapping reduced quadruples.

For it is the nature of Minkowski’s neighbor concept, [3], that any two
neighboring triples overlap; but by the theorem in 5 these triples ar
tained (discounting sign) in a reduced quadruple if they are bases.

Now we use the further information that any two Minkowskian triples
are connected by the Minkowski neighbor process. The proof is based on a
topological argument suggested by Minkowski (and proved in [2], p. 342).
Since every degenerate Minkowskian triple has non-degenerate triples (i e.,
basis triples) as neighbors, it takes very little effort to deduce from the same
proof that any two Minkowskian bases are connected by a chain of Minkowskian
bases as neighbors. Hence the lemmas yield the following result and with it
the “ discoverability ” of all units:

e con-

THEOREM. Any two reduced quadruples can be connected by a chain of
newghboring (reduced) quadruples.

19. Proximity of algorithms. In Section § (above) we showed that
every Minkowskian basis is part of a reduced quadruple, which means, in
effect, that every Minkowskian triple overlaps a reduced quadruple. The
“converse ” seems to be false, indicating that there are “more” reduced
quadruples than Minkowskian triples in some sense perhaps analogous to the
sense that the quadratic algorithm we introduced in 2 (above), possessing
“mediants ” in addition to regular convergents of the simple continued frac-
tion contains “more ” reduced triples (see Section 25 below). Lemma 18.2
