Dear Phil,

A.W.Swan, whonyou may remember, is planning a visit
to Canada for a few weeks in the near future. He is doing
this in rather sad circumstances as his wife has just died and
he is making the visit rather to give himself something to do,
and would like to meet a number of O.R. people in Canada “while
he is there. As you know, he was formerly in charge of the
C.R.Group at Courtaulds, one of the biggest groups in the
country, and he retired about two or three years ago.

I have given him your name and address and if he
gets in touch with you I am sure you will be kind enough to
see him. His address in the U.K. is:-

6, Vicarage Road,
Lillington,
Leamington Spa,
Warwickshire.

and while in Canada: -
C/o-A.F.Hanly,
615 Carleton Avenue,

Westmount,
Montreal.

Yours sincerely,

,..
