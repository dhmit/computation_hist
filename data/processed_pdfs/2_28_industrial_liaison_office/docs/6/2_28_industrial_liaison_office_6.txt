: This will confirm our conversation regarding technical and progress 5

reports emanating from the Computation Center. The Industrial Liaison
Office is interested in continuing its distribution of publications
relating to M.I.T. computational activities. As you know we have been

distributing 330 copies of the Whirlwind Quarterly Progress Report. We

- have been purchasing these reports at incremental printing prices. We
now wish to distribute the biannual progress reports which the Compu~
~ tation Center will produce. In line with this interest we would be glad
~~ to have as many copies of your Progress Report #1 dated June 1957 as you
can spare. g ER a |

Should any technical reports be published by the Computation Center
in the future we would of course be grateful for being kept in mind to
receive the usual number for our distribution list. Thank you for your
splendid cooperation and continued support of the Industrial Liaison
