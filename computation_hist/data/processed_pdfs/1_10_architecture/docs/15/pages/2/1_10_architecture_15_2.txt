Professor P. M. Morse -2- April 27, 1956

I then talked to Mr. Deri about the air conditioning equip-
ment and was told it would take substantially all the basement. Also,
they could not do any more work on that until the 704 layout was com-
pleted. I do not agree with this, since the ducts can be laid anywhere
in the false floor to the machines. I felt I could not argue this over
the telephone so it was dropped.

There is to be another meeting in Mr. Peterson's office at
M IT on April 23, 1956 at which time we will try to resolve the
final decisions on the questions raised above.
Sincerely yours,
