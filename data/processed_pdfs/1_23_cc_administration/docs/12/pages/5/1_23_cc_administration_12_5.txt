Budget -~ Development work of the sort described can be
continued Igaefinitely, of course, but the first results of the program
will provide the greafsst benefits in making the machine more versatile
and easy to use. Intensification of the program for three years would
enable many improvements to be made, soon enough to affect many pro--
grams for machine use now being made at the cooperating institutions.
The additional financial support %o carry out this development work
is not large, compared to the contributions now being made by IBM and
by the cooperating institutions, but the work cannot be done without
additional funds.
