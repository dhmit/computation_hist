Dear Professor Morse:

I am organizing a session of four invited 30 minute papers for the
WJCC with the following titles:

e 1f T could solve the following problems, I could then
produce several million logical elements per cubic inch,

2 If T had available such a high density of logic elements,
this is the kind of computer I would build,

3. If I had this kind of computer available, this is how I
would program it.

i, If we had such programs, this could be the effect on our
society,

The WJCC will be held in San Francisco on May 3, L, and 5, 1960.
The final drafts of these invited papers for prepublication in the
Conference Proceedings are due March 1, 1960. Preliminary drafts are
due January 15, 1960.

I solicit your expression of interest in participating in this
session, If you are interested, I would appreciate your so indicating
as soon as possible. If not, please consider who among your acquaint-
ances you would recommend as the speaker for any of the four topics.

Naturally, each of the selected speakers will have to know what his
predecessor will say. For example, speaker number 3 will have to know
what kind of computer speaker number 2 is planning to design in order for
him to plan his remarks on programming. And so with speaker number l
with respect to speaker number 3., We plan, therefore, to have a meeting
among the four participants as soon as they are selected. It is hoped
that this meeting can take place before December 1, 1959.

The scope of this session has inspired very favorable comment., I
hope you can contribute to its success.

P. S. Please return enclosed form NSt/ s,
as soon as possible, Louis Fein
