Dear Phil:

This is in response to your letter of May 13 concerning
meetings of directors of university computing centers. My own
feeling about organized meetings for directors of computing centers
is a negative one. I regard such directors as comparable to heads
of regular university departments with similar problems, and cannot
conceive of very many problems which could be discussed usefully at
some formal meeting. It is, of course, always pleasant to meet with
friends and acquaintances faced with problems similar to one's own,
but I would think that there is no really useful purpose to be gained
by setting up a set of formal meetings. I would say that if there
were, such formal meetings of heads of mathematics and physics de-
partments would have been arranged in the past. I am sorry I don't
seem to be very helpful in the problem that you are presently faced
with, but there does not seem to be anything in a positive direction
that I can say.

I hope that it won't be long before we see each other.
With very best regards,

As ever yours,
