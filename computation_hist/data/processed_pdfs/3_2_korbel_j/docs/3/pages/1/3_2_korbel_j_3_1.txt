Proposal for a Statistical Investigation of Labor Force Participationm
and Mobility to be completed by September 30, 18358,

This request is for $23,805 to finamce a study of the labor force
participation responses of imdividuals, The object would be to estimate
the probabilities that individuals would emter, remain in, depart from
or remain out of the labor force under various combimations of circum-
stances or inputs, The inputs to be considered would include the demow
graphic and economic characteristics of the individual and his family;
his past status with respect to labor force participation; aad certain
characteristics of his environment such as region, urbanization and the
state of labor demand,

These estimates would be used to implement the Momte Carlo type
gsimulation of the United States social-economic system proposed by Orcutt.1
Such a simulation requires large numbers of parameters or sets of operating
characteristics describing the behavior of the imdividual decision-making
components of the system, These operating characteristics are the
probabilities of various types of response or ~outputs’ under various sets
of prior circumstances, stimuli or "imputs’,

Besides serving the Orcutt model, such & multivariate statistical
investigation would also have valuable by-products, Due to the simul taneous
action of the variables referred to above upon labor force participation and
turnover, it has beem extremely difficult to disenangle their iafluemces,
Published tabulatioms relating to labor force participation and gross flows
into and out of the labor force have not beem sufficiently cross-classified
to sustain the necessary statistical analysis, The funds being requested
would be used primarily for covering the expense of finer cross classifications
of Curremt Population Survey results tham have heretofore been carried out,
Multivariate statistical analysis applied to such cross-classifications
would isolate the several influences and their interactioms so as to
alleviate the necessity for coming to comclusiomns such as the following:
"whether the well-educated woman who marries and has childrem is more or less

likely to be employed than the mother who has less educatiom is mot knovn."2
