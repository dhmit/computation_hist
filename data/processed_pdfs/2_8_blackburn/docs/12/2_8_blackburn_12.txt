Dear Prof. Corbato,

I have noted that all the requests from within IBM for the 704
Course Notes prepared at MIT are from persons who already have in their
possession both the 704 Manual of Operation and the Fortran Programmers
Reference Manual. In all cases that I have observed, this is also true of
requests from within MIT and from the other New England colleges. This
would indicate that nearly everyone who has one 704 Manual and one Fortran
manual automatically has two.

I believe we decided that when publication of the Course Notes
was turned over to Technology Press, it would contain the Course Notes
written at MIT and the Fortran Introductory Programmers Manual, Sections
I, II, and Ili but would not include the regular 704 Manual or the regular
Fortran Programmers Reference Manual. I recommend that effective
immediately we distribute the MIT Course Notes with the Fortran Introductory
Programmers Manual, Sections I, II, and III {when available) as one package
and that the 704 Manual and Fortran Programmers Reference Manual be
distributed separately.

Sincerely yours,

; J. Â¥. Blackburn
