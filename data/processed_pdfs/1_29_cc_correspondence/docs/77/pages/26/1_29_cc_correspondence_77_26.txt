ETC

DUP

 

 

 

The ETC pseudo-operation is used to extend the variable
fields of VFD and CALL pseudo-operations. The location
field of the ETC must be blank; the variable field contains

one or more subfields.

The ETC pseudo-operation may appear only after a VFD, a
CALL, or an ETC. The ETC must not appear immediately
after the last instruction in the range of a DUP.

The variable field of the instruction preceding an ETC
may contain any number of complete subfields that are

terminated by a comma and a blank.

The DUP (duplicate) pseudo-operation is used to cause a
series of instructions to be duplicated. Its primary use

is the generation of tables. The variable field must

consist of exactly two subfields, each of which is a

symbolic expression all of whose symbols have been previously
defined (or a phase error results). 'DUP M,N" means,
"Duplicate the next M instructions N times'. Although

this often results in the generation of MN machine words,

a greater or lesser number of words may be generated if
pseudo-operations are included among the instructions
generated. Note that the first subfield is a count of
assembler instructions (symbolic cards), not of machine
words, The set of M instructions to be duplicated is

called thelggggg of the DUP pseudo-operation in question.

Any operation or pseudo-operation may occur in the range

of a DUP pseudo-operation except another DUP pseudo-operation,
or a BSS, BES, or COMMON pseudo-operation which uses asterisk
as a symbol in its variable field. A symbol in the location
field of the DUP pseudo-operation is given, as its value,

the current value of the location counter. Symbols in the
location fields of instructions in the range of the DUP

pseudo-operation are given the values they would have
