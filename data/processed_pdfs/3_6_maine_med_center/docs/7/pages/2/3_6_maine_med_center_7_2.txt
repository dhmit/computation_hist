Since the double-layer electrolytic tank has no bound-

ary error, equations applying to infinite two-dimen-

sional media can be used. Perfused frog hearts were
placed in the center of this tank. If the resultant dipole
of the heart, M, makes an angle 8’ with the 4 X axis,
the potential V, at a distance 7, along this axis is given
by
M cos ¢

The value of 8’ is substituted in r or 2 to find M. M and
6’ were found as a function of time during the ventricu-
lar complex for bullfrog and leopard frog hearts. With
the anatomical heart axis along the O° line, 6’ varied
between the limits —40° to +70°. The order of magni-
tude of M max in the ‘frontal’ plane was 8o u A-cm for
the bullfrog and 6 u A-cm for the leopard frog. As pre-
viously reported, M max = 1000 u A-cm for the human
heart (horizontal plane). (Supported by U. S. Public
