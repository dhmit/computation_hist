AT THE M.I.T. COMPUTATION CENTER INTO METHODS FOR
MAKING HIGH-SPEED DIGITAL COMPUTERS EASIER TO USE
BY THE OCCASIONAL USER

 

Statement of the Problem - Large, electronic digital computers
have great potentialities for advancing research in the many areas
which require a great deal of drudge calculation, but up to now
their potential capabilities have been hampered by a "mismatch"
between machine and possible user. Special input equipment is not
vet designed to allow masses of experimental data to be fed directly
to the machine; special output equipment is needed in order to display
results in compact and easily understandable form; and the present
. code of instructions to the machine the "machine langauge” is not
easy to learn or to use.

The basic difficulty is that electronic computers are extremely
complex pieces of equipment and a great deal of study will be
required before we can understand its behavior well enough to be
able to control it effortlessly and flexibly. At present one who
wishes to use a large computer often has to spend three to five months
developing, encoding and testing a program to instruct the machine how
to perform the necessary millions of operations which, at the end, The
computer will carry through in a few hours. True, these five months
of preparation plus the few hours of actual computation may be much
shorter than the several years required to obtain the same results by
using a desk computer, nevertheless it is obviously desirable to
devise procedures which will shorten this preparation time, even at
the expense of additional machine time.

Pro for Research on Machine Capabilities - In order to
learn how GO make digital computers easier co use one must have a

machine of large capacity, a large supply of possible computations

to be done, drawn from a wide variety of scientific fields, plus a
staff which thoroughly understands the machine behavior and is
interested in working with the prospective users in order to simplify
methods of use, With this combination of equipment and staff it
should be possible, in a few years, tc work out special operating
programs, additional input and output equipment and other techniques
which will considerably reduce the time and effort required to get

a problem solved by the machine,

The M.I.T. Computation Center - The one place in the United
states where this combination of machine, variety of problems and
staff already exists 48 at M.I.T. This past year IBM has installed
a 704, of the most up-to-date capacity for the use of the college
and universities of New England. M.I.T. has contributed most of the


supervisory and faculty staff, the other colleges have also con=
tributed faculty time. Machine time 1s free, though the user must
prepare his own coded program. To date faculty and students from

27 colleges and universities have used the facilities and 150 problems
are being or have been run, representing several dozen different
scientific, engineering and academic fields, Details of the program are
are given in the appended Progress Report.

Here is a combination ideally suited for the prosecution of
research directed toward reducing the "mismatch" between the machine
and the occasional user. All that is needed to start a vigorous
program are additional funds to augment the staff, which are at present
too busy helping individual users to have time to work out the improved
techniques suggested by thelr present work. No money is needed for
machine rental or maintenance; this is already supplied by IBM. Nor
is money needed for ‘machine operators or card-punch operators. The
additional funds can be used entirely in suppérting the additional
staff needed to intensify the research on machine behavior and to work
out the improved techniques for machine use arising therefrom, and in
purchasing or constructing the special input-output equipment which
will increase the machine's flexibility.

This special support need not be continued indefinitely. An
intensive program for three to five years should solve many of the
outstanding problems and enable the Center to drop back to its present
level of expenditure, but with a greatly enhanced utility to the
academic fraternity in New England because of the results of the
program. The results of the work will be immediately available to
the several hundred other TO} installations and, with little additional
modification, to the users of other makes of digital computers.
Present makes of digital computers have many more properties in common
than differences, and what is learned on one machine can be carried
over to the others without much modification.

Development of Utility Programs - In addition to assisting
individual users in putting their problem on the machine, the Center
staff have the important task of making the machine easier to use by
all users. It always takes time, the experience of many users, to
reveal all the capabilities of any piece of machinery; this 1s
particularly true of high-speed computers. Because of their speed
and complexity it may take a dozen years Or more before even the full
capabilities of our present machines are known, and by that Time
machines of still more speed and complexity will be built. A computer
of the size of the TOY has an order of complexity such that its —
designers literally are not aware of all of its capabilities. Con-
sequently it is important that research into these capabilities be
carried on; such research, revealing easier ways of obtaining results
and new methods of operation, may at times go farther in increasing
machine serviceability for the general user than can the providing of
a new machine with increased speed or capacity.

L few years ago a machine user had to become familiar with
binary arithmetic and with all the other idiosyncrasies of the primary
machine operating code, just as the early auto owner had to be familiar
with spark and choke and clutch. As Time goes on 1¥ is less and less
necessary for the occasional user to master all these details in order
to use the machine, even if he has to devise a program for a new problem.
Tn the first place, many of the more usual calculations will have been
already programmed so that, for example, if one wishes to compute a
Bessel function or to apply the chi-squared test for the fit of a
formula to a set of data, one need only use the ready-tested program.
In the second place;—it is possible to provide a heirarchy of "trans-
lation procedures" -- assembly and operator programs, ete. -- whereby
the machine itself will translate the desires of the user, expressed
in language more familiar to him, into the specialized "language" of
the basic machine code. This may be termed programming at the second
