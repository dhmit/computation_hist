scientific and social implications of high-speed compuation .

Professor Carr

Representatives of the Ann Arbor center for educational TV
have repeatedly expressed interest in receiving a definite proposal
along these lines that would include an outline of the subject matter, a
list of prospective guests, and indications of the format to be followed.
We have discussed the preparation of such a presentation with a good
many people in the M.I.T. Computation Center and Lincoln Laboratory,
and with local representatives of the International Business Machines
Corp., and have received many good suggestions. But no one has had
time to organize the material and follow up these suggestions. Nor
have we succeeded thus far in finding a person who is competent and
available to assume respousibility for this series if a grant to produce
it is obtained.

Mr. Theodore Sherbura, who was formerly with WGBH, is now a
program coordinator in the Ann Arbor educational TV center and will
recall clearly the early discussions of this idea here. You might find
it helpful to have a taik with him if there ig a possibility that you wouid
be interested in associating yourself with such a project.

We believe that there are excellent facilities in Cambridge and the
immediate vicinity for the production of a truly educational series of
television programs about computers, and all of the many authorities
here with whom we have talked have been sympathetic with the idea
and willing to cooperate.

Professor Morse recommends you highly as a person who could carry
out such a project in a way that would please both scholars and the audi-
ences for educational TV programs, and [ hope very much that you will
find this suggestion attractive. We would be most grateful for some
indication of your reaction as early as convenient.

With best wishes,

Sincerely yours,

Volta Torrey
