Dear Mr., Jones:

Today I received the "final tentative agenda” of the fourth meeiing
dM,MIWthMM!MmM;hyI«WGmO
we will pot be repvesented in person:

1.

3.

4.

The MIT senior programming staff are currently giving some thought
to the development of an interpretive algebraic system -- it is too
early to make definite statements regarding specifications. However,

it is quite obvious that the key punches and interpreters ghould have

a number of modifications which will increase the utility of their
system., We concur with the UAC proposal of December 30 regarding
modifications to key punches and interpreters.

Since we at MIT are hoping to use the UAC system, we are very
interested in Ramshaw's "new 704 instructious and hardward" as
deseribed in his letter of December 23, Although we have not had
time to make s thorough evaluation of the 30 additional instruction,
we gee no areas of disagreement. We are very much in favor of the
suggestion yvegarding the RPQ on automatic carriage control as stated
in Ramshaw's letter of January 10,

Your task assignments of the subcommittee on programming, eﬁe. »
appear very satisfactory. Ve hope we can get into the act before
too iong.

in connection with the "configuration of the computer of the next
mechine gemeration", I will merely mention that there is to be &
seminar at MIT on March 1 and 2 dealing with Microprogramming. NSF-_
has promised to issue proceedings of this meeting, hence interested
parties may get copies of them,

Since the number of 704's in the field is limited, it appears to us

-, -

._\.

that IEM should be able to notify SHARE membership of individual RPQ's.

We are very much interested in the SHARE decision regavding obligations,

ote., Presumably this matter will be decided at the meeting,
