Dear Dr. Blackburn:

I have just roceived a letter from Dr, R, N, Johanson
dated June 24, concerning the hiring of an additional 704
~ operator,

You must recall our recent discussions concerning the
establishment of a third shift for the Center znd in which I
informed you that I would have to hire additional personnel to
man the third shift for the New England Colleges, I'd like
very much to begin the third shift operation as soon as possible,
Obviously, I cannot do this without nacessary operating personnel,

| You undoubtedly recall ‘the terms of our contract in
which we indicated that three operators may be hired for the
New England CBlleges "as soon as the work load justifies the need”,
I am hereby requesting that you consider our needs in this light
and advise me concerning the hiring of additional personnel on the
New England Machine Operator Account -~ 2747B,

I would appreciate hearing from you concerning this
matter at your earliest convenience -- perhaps, we can discuss it
at one of your forthcoming visits to MIT?

Sincerely yours,

F., M, Verzuh
Assistant Director
