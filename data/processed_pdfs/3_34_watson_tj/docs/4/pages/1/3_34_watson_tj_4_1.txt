Dear Professor Morse:

As discussed during the meeting of the Advisory Committee of
the Cooperating Institutions on 28 March 1958, I would like to comment
on the effectiveness of the IBM-sponsored arrangement whereby the New
England colleges and universities have the opportunity to become ac-
quainted with the operation and capacity of the 704 computer, The ex-
perience (for the third time) of going over the applications from so
many diversely trained and interested individuals, taken in conjunction
with the information we have been collecting about present participants,
led us to make some evaluative statements about the conception of the
assistantship program.

I believe the Advisory Committee was in unanimous agreement
that the plan was working out most successfully. Each of us felt that
our home institution had gained immensely by virtue of the new knowledge
which has been infusing our campus due to activities of the assistants
and associates. We have now seen enough instances of this spread of
knowledge so that it is possible to appraise the value of the coopera-
tive plan. Speaking both personally and for the Advisory Committee
may I suggest that you relay to the IBM Corporation our high regard
for the excellence of the plan and our sincere thanks for the generous
financial support which has been given to the personnel of the coopera-
ting institutions.

Yours cordially,

P n e g

leonard C, Mead
