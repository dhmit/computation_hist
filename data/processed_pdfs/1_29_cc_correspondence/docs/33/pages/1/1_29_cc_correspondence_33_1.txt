SUBJECT: Programming for the 709 Computer

L. Introduction

As was recently announced the IBM Corporation will soon .
install an IBM 709 computer to replace the present 704 computer
.at the Computation Center. Both of these computers are furnished
frée-of—charge and maintained by the IBM Corporation. Thé 70&
wlll stop operating on June 30, 1960; the 709 is expected to
be operating by August 1, 1960. The memo which follows is a
summary of the essential information required for 709 program-
ming. It is expected that there will be further memos
clarifying areas which cause difficulty. In addition,~a
"Procedures Handbook" will be developed to codify many of the

detalls which are described in these transition memos.

The 709 computer will have a 32,768 word core memory,
two channels, about 10 magnetic tape units, an on-line printer,
an on-line card punch, an on-line card reader, and a viewing
and photographing cathode ray tube unit. (An additional two
channels, a direct data entry device and about three tape units
are reserved for development of a time-sharing project for
the IBM 7090 due 1n January 1962.) On all channels there will be
the data channel trap feature which includes the option of indirect

addressing of channel commands. It should be noted that the 709
