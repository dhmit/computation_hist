APPROXIMATION NEWSLETTER
(Late edition--very)

After a long hiatus, we finally present
another installment of our cartoon strip
adventures,

The Converging Pp Method (Part V)

Let us glance back at the Part IV install-
ment. We finished there with a deviation
decreasing cycle in which the greatest
érror of approximation was reduced to
€=.558. In the initial portion of the next
cycle, deviations of magnitude (.358)(.85)=
. 504 are imposed at i=1 and i=2, with the
result given in (2) after 'Compute Error
Data.' Here «295%.358 and this cycle turns
out to be a 'p Increasing Cycle' as indi-
cated in (3).

The calculation

(1) pi= =Le200 ops

takes place.

The more delicate touch that is applied in
the next cycle thru use of p=.925 becomes
evident in (4). Note that (.358)(.925)=,33]
and that .3317,3207, as a result .331 is
imposed at i=] and .507 is imposed at i=2,
Because of the situation achieved in ;
memory B in (4), the control now shifts to
deviations i=0 and i=] as Pictured in (5),

This is the situation that we have been
Trying to achieve; nothing now stands in
the way of Successful convergence.
