5 'é . received had the DUP not occurred, (i.e. the values they
; % i? have during the first iteration of the DUP), and are not
multiply defined. When the asterisk is used as a symbol,
it is redefined during each iteration of the DUP. This
gives a very powerful method of generating tables. Tor
example:
LOCATION OP VARIABLE FIELD
TL DUP 110
VFD 20/**100-T1*100,16/T1
is equivalent to
DUP 1,10
Tl VFD 20/%%*100-T1%100,16/T1
which is equivalent to
Tl VFD 20/0,16/T1
VFD 20/100,16/T1
VFD 20/200,16/T1
VFD 20/300,16/T1
VFD 20/400,16/T1
VFD 20/500,16/T1
VFD 20/600,16/T1
VFD 20/700,16/T1
VFD 20/800,16/T1
VFD 20/900,16/T1
REM The REM (remarks) pseudo-operation is used to enter comments
into the assembly listing. The contents of the REM card are
copied onto the listing (except for the letters REM which are
replaced by three blanks) and the card is otherwise ignored
by the assembler,
