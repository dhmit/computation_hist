The next idea that comes to mind is essentially one that was
used at the last ACM meeting, where there was an open discussion of com-
puters which not only did arithmetic but also carried along an indication
of the accuracy of the numbers which were stored, BEven at the ACM
meeting, the notion of error propagation being treated in better than an
abstract way seemed novel to some of the participants, The specific items
which should be brought out are procedures carrying along probable error
(an unsure compromise), Z procedurescarrying along maximum error (this
usually says that the results have mo significance), and finaslly, the
procedure of range numbers, wherein the number being calculated is con-
tained in the range of the two values, It should be brought out that, in
contrast to the first two procedures which indicate nothing about the con-
vergence of the process, the range method faithfully refleects numerically
convergent (and divergeamt) procedures, Of course, all of the above remarks
should be prefaced by the suggestion that the various procedures can be
gsimulated and warraant further study.,

It might be an interesting novelty to those persons who like to
listen better than they like to read, to have a lecture or two on mew computing
machines, in the sense that a discussion of the features and specifications
be made, Inasmuch as I.B.M, does not make all machines, there are clearly
political overtones to this suggestion,

Finally, to enter into the blue-sky realm, it would be nice if
anyone had interesting things to say about the use of real-time inter-
vention and interaction with computers, In particular, I am thinking of
such devices as light guns, analog computers, and, in the field of data
processing, parallel operations by, say, n clerks using 1 computer with
intimate feedback, This subject leads maturally into the discussion of
blue-sky hardware and I wonder if any more could be said about such ideas
of machine design as multi-control computers with control hierarchies
under fixed and/or computer-set priorities (the TX-2 Computer of Linececln
Laboratory, built under the supervision of Wes Clark, is a start in this
direction),

I consider the above to be a sketch of ideas which I hope will
help the Executive Board think of better ones, Â¥You will note that I have
not mentioned compilers or FORTRAN, primarily because I am sure they will
be talked about anyway by the logquacious set, I really am interested in
both subjects and consequently it makes me feel like a killjoy to suggest
some of the SHARE gabble is hot air, Constructive discussion is welcome,

Hope this helps,

Sincerely,
