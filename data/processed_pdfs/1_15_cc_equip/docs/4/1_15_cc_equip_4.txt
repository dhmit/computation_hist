Dear Jack:

The purpose of this letter is to give you official written
indication of the termination notice concerning the equipment currently
rented by the Office of Statistical Services on your account number
55610-07 -- the 07 account, Dr, Hunter indicated that IBM would
terminate its program of supporting sixty per cent (60%) of the G50
installation on June 30, 1957, In accordance with our discussions with
Mr. Cusick, Assistant MIT Treasurer, this is to inform you that MIT

wishes to terminate its rental of this equipment effective June 30, 1957,

In view of your recent telephone call indicating that IBM
needs additional time to remove the equipment, I am therefore extending
the termination date to July 5, 1957 -- realizing you do need additional
time to temove this equipment from the premises.

‘To be gpecific about the machine types involved, I would like
the following Hac¢liines removed from MIT:

That is, all of the machines in the 07 account are to be removed with
the exception of the Interpreter Type No. 552-16965. This machine is
tc be transferred to the 05 account which is to be used for the
performance of work for the administrative offices. Mr. Rose should
make out the necessary changes in our invoices so that beginning
July 1 the interpreter appears on the 05 account.

I am writing you a separate letter concerning the educationdl
requirements of 650 time which will have to be arranged with the rhe
10M Corporation for the theses which are currently under way.
