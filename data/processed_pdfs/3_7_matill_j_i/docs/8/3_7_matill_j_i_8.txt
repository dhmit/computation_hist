Dear Professor lorse,

TI hope that in due course you will see some results
from the session at the Computation Center for College Public
Relations people last weeks I know from visiting with them
after your talk that all found it most helpful. And I am

only sorry that I could not be on hand myself,

Thank you for your help.
