Dear Harvey:

Thanks for your letter. I think we'd be
interested in your compiler for 650, if you are going
to write it up. We are getting along with ours for
the 704. If you come east, we'd be glad to talk it

over.

Don't forget to let us know about bright
youngsters. If they are interested in going on for
an advanced degree, with specialization in computer

use, we have assistantships.

Yours,

Philip M. Morse, Director
M.I.T. Computation Center
