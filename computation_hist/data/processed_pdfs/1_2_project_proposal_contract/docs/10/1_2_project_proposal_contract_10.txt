Dear Sir:

The Maesechueetts Institute of Technology submits
herewith a'revised proposal for extension of the reference contract
to June 30, 1957 at on additional estimated cost of $20,960.00.

We understand that this proposal has been the subject of discus-
sions between Professor P. M. Morse of MIT and Mr. A. J. Wise

of ONE-MIT, Dr. Carl F. Makenheupt of ONRsBcston, and Dr. F. J.
Weyl of ONR=Washington.

There follows a sﬁmmery of expenditures and funds
remaining on the two projects, Whirlwind Operation and Machine
Methods of Computation, which are currently active under the
reference contract:

Project #63h5 (Whirlwind Operation) has an unexpended
balance of $97,000 as or November 30, 1955. The current expend-
itures are approximately $10,000 per month. The’everage “income!
received for Whirlwind usage is approximately $3,000 per month -—
a net expenditure of $7,000‘per month. If it is assumed that the
present level of income ($3,000 per month) is maintained during
the nineteen-month period December 1, 1955 to June 30, 1957, a
minimum amount, assuming some tapering off, of $119,000 will be
required during this period.

However, for the purpose of establishiné'an estimate or
unexpended funds on this project as of June 30, 195 . it is esti-
mated that a higher level of income will exist during the remaining
seven months. This may average'oomething above 3%,000 a month. On
this basis we estimate that $57,000 of the $97,000 mentioned above
will remain unexpended as of June 30, 1956, An additional factor
affecting the budget shown on page E is the eetimated Computer
Income for the one-year period ending June 30, 1957. For this period
only $18,000 in Computer Income has been estimated. This is in.
fluenced by two factors: one being a expectea tapering-off of the
use of the Whirlwind machine by other projects, and secondly the
expectsa beginning of operations under the ZEM Type 70“ machine.

Project #69%i (Machine Methods of computation) has an
unexpended balance of"? 1,000 as of November 30, 1955. The current
expenaitures are approximately $7,000 per month. If it is assumed
that the present expenditures remain comet there will be a balance
of approximately $22,000 on June 30, 1956. 'l accordance with our
preeent‘plans'for terminating the ONE supy a of this project on
June 30, 1956, there will be certain addiﬁ 131 coats extimsted at
$7,000 ascocioteo with the closing out of this project incluﬂing ouch

items as the preparation or summary reports on the program of
Machine Methods of Computation.

This summary is based on estimates prepared by Prof—
essor P. M. Morseg

Professor Morse further advises that the expected
arrival of an IBM TYpe 70“ Electronic Data Processing Machine at
MIT about January 1, 1957 will create a definite need for addi—
tional fundsmoto finance the conversion of existing Whirlwind
programs to Type 704 programso

Under the proposed plan submitted herewith, Project
#63M5 (Whirlwind Operation) would terminate on June 30, 1957.
The task order for this period would include the usual whirlwind
project activities: '

1. Research in methods of numerical analysis and
the formulation of scientific problems for machine
solution, together with the training of personnel
in these methods.

2“ Support of the Scientific and Engineering Applica-
tions Group of Project Whirlwind so as to make the
computer useful and available for the above-mentioned
research.

In addition, it is proposed that the following task
order arising in connection with the Type 704 EDPM be included:

3. The development of a suitable interpretive program
and associated coding techniques to permit effective
implementation of the Type 70” machine.

It is anticipated that a separate project will be set
up to handle the Type 704 utilization within the MIT Computation
Center, and a separate request to the ONE for support of this work
will be made in the near future. In this respect certain
experienced programmers could'be made avail ble for transfer to
this new task as of January 1, 195?, This p Qicipated transfer

has been taken into account in the budget pr posed for Project #63H5.

 
 

 

The foregoing proposal does not take into consideration
termination costs which may be associated with the close out of
this contract and the possible disposition of the Whirlwind Computer.
It is proposed to delay the submittal of any budget for this matter
until such time as disposition of the Whirlwind Computer is
determined.
