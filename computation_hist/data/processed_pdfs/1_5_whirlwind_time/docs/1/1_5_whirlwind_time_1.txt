Dear Mr, Scherb:

I have been authorized to credit your account with 9 additional
hours of machine time on the Whirlwind I computer for work on problem 273,
Analysis of Air Shower Data, 8

You might be interested to know that since your problem began,
you have used 1807 minutes (as of October 14) of computer time. If your prob-
lem had been charged at the regular rate of $250/hvur, the total amount charged
to you would have been $7,528.77.

If you find that you need more time, it will be necessary to
submit a new request.

Sincerely,

F., RK, Verzuh
