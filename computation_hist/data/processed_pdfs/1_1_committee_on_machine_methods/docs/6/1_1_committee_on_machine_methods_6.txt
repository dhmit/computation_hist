Minutes of the Sixth meeting
of the
Committee on Machine Methods of Computation
January 3, 1951 ‘

Members Present: H. Feshbach, J. w. Forrester, Z. Kopal, C. Lin,
and E. Reissner

The Committee, in the first part of its meeting, continued
the discussion of courses presently available at the Institute on
numerical analysis and possible additions to such. In the Mathea
matics Department there are two such courses: (1) M54, which
deals with such topics as numerical and graphical methods and
elementary numerical analysis; (2) a course in integral equations,
M631, which contains some applications of numerical analysis to
that subject. There is a course in the Mechanical Engineering
Department, 2.215T. It is expected that this would be an advanced
course involving the application of numerical techniques to the
vibrations of discrete and continuous systems. Forrester's group
intends to offer a course in the Electrical Engineering Department
under the heading of nSpecial Problems in blectrical Engineering"
(6.68). This would essentially be a continuation of the course
Welchman gives. Itiwould be primarily a laboratory course, which
will emphasize the use of the Whirlwind and will have the intent
of familiarizing the students with its operational procedures.

 

The Committee then turned to a discussion of whether the
courses on numerical analysis given st the Institute are suffi-
ciently complete. Kopal emphasized the point that the cleavage
of mathematical analysis and the machine use of same should not
be maintained; particularly, the problem of how to arithmetize a
problem for a given machine should be treated somewhere. The
Committee then outlined a course for Numerical Analysis for the
equations of mathematical physics. This can be conveniently
broken up into two parts: (1) Background material which shculi
include the classification of partial differential equations and
boundary conditions, the proper coordinate systems for each type
of equation and the ways in Which the problem can be formulated;
viz., as an integral or as a variational problem. (2) Methods
which should include perturbation methods} variation methods,
iterations and arithmetizstion. The discussion of these should
be oriented toward 1 the eventual solutions of the problems by
numerical methods 2 their range of applicability. it should be
emphasized that all of these methods are interwrelated and can be
used together on a given problem. in the problem of numerical 2
analysis one is interested in combining the process 01 eritnmetlmaw

cussion on this course, it was emphasized that the question of

personnel to teach it needed to be settled before one could de-
lineate in more detail what the course should contain.

The Committee next turned to contracts. It was agreed that,
implicitly or explicitly, contracts should containlrovisions for
the support of educational activities and research. These should
be flexible. The contract for Whirlwind was discussed. Here the
Government contributes the major fraction of its support. The
understanding is that the machine would be available half-time for
educational activities, although it is not explicitly stated in
the contract what the actual time fraction is. The contracting
agency has, at times, brought in outside as well as inside groups
who have an interest in using the machines for calculations. These
were generally scientific in nature, though not all were in this
category. The use of machines by members of the Institute working
on other contracts for the Government was discussed. It was felt
that if the problem is of a fundamental scientific nature this
should be included in the category of machine time for educational
and scientific research. 0n the other hand, it was felt that no
contract at the Institute should be drawn which depended on the
essential existence of a machine without further discussion.

The next meeting will be January 10, at 9:30 A.m., in Room
6nlO9. The above discussion will be continued, and, in addition,
the program for the Computation Seminar for next term will be
considered.
