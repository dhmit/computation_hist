MEMO TO: Arden, Corbato and Verzuh
FROM: Philip M. Morse

SUBJECT: Visit of Naval War College Officers, November 13.
| >

The group, about twelve senior officers, will arrive at M.I.T.
about 9.30 in their own cars from Newport. Is it possible to
arrange parking space for them? They wish to do the following

things while here:

1. Hear about how machines work (operation, not
construction).

2. Hear discussion on how machines might be used
in military planning. I'll talk about war
gaming, somebody should talk about the logistics
use (transportation, etc.
3, Have a chance to ask questions about 1 and 2.
4, See the Vhirlwind movie.
5. See Whirlwind.
They will leave about 4 p.m. or before.
Will you let me know, by October 23, what order these five
things should be in and who should take part, so we all won't
be tied up all day with them. For example, 1T would be nice

if they could see the movie and WW from 2.30 to 4.00 so we
could attend the seminar.
