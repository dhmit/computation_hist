The first draft or the memorandum to the Adminis-
tration on Requirements for Electronic Computing Equipment
for Educational Uses was discussed. Some changes were made
in the phraseolow, and a few additions were made for clari-
fication. The modified memorandum will be sent to Dr. Stratton

and Professor Flee, and Horse will follow this up with dis-
cussions.

 

The machine seminars, held this year every other
week, were discussed. It was suggested that the have been
trying to cover too much ground and to interest so wide an
audience, and that this is the reason for the large fluctua-
tions in attendance. It was suggested that we start, next
year, with the staff members of the "Project and with the ‘
committee Members and build a seminar which would be primarily
of interest to this group. The interesting of others would
be desirable but not a primary consideration.

Lin reported that Williams is not accepting the
offer tendered him. Peshbach is investigating one other pos— -
sibility (Purkis) and will report back in a week. ~ , =
