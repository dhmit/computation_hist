ON THE FINITE DETERMINATION OF CRITICAL LATTICES
HARVEY COHN!

1. Introduction. We are concerned here with the determination of
critical lattices with respect to a given finite convex body K contain-
ing the origin and symmetric to it. According to the usual termino-
ogy, a critical lattice is a K-admissible lattice of minimal determinant,

‘while a K-admissible lattice is one all of whose points, except the
origin, lie on or outside K. It is not hard to show [5, p. 13]? that a
critical lattice exists for every such XK.

In d-dimensional space a lattice is determined by d2 real variables or
d vectors af, az, - - -, a;. If K is defined by a gauge function, in
vector form ®(x;) <1, then the problem is to minimize the de-
terminant of the a; subject to the infinitude of side conditions

(1) (pros + paca + + + + + paay) > 1

where (p;) runs through all integer sets except the origin. Now, as
mentioned earlier it is possible to show the existence of a critical
lattice of positive determinant, in fact, by the use of a compactness
argument. We shall show, however, by means of a theorem in the
companion paper [1], that the infinite set (1) can be reduced to a
finite set whose number of inequalities depends only on d. Thus, for
instance, we are assured that when K is bounded by algebraic sur-
faces, then among the (possibly continuous) set of critical lattices, a
lattice with an algebraic basis can be found.

Results such as these are implied in the classical reduction theory
of quadratic forms and of star bodies [2]. Indeed, Minkowski [3, pp.
51, 101] solved the problem for convex bodies explicitly when d =2
and 3, giving the most economical set of inequalities. The sets given
here will be far from economical, but the methods will be compari-
tively simple and geometrically intuitive.

2. Finite bases lemma. Let w;, wy, * wg bea sel of d independent
vectors on the surface of the finite symmetric convex body K, and belong-
ing to a K-admissible lattice. Then the lattice has a basis from the follow-
ing finite set:

and =

This result is due to Minkowski [4, p. 189]; we therefore simply
note some special aspects of the lemma which tie in with familiar
results. In case there are more than d vectors (and their negatives)
on the surface, let us choose (w;") so as to produce a minimal positive
determinant. Then for d=2 the basis can always be chosen as
(wr, wy) itself, while for d=3 it can be chosen as (w;, w,, w;) or
(wr, wg, (wy +w; +w;)/2), as was known to Minkowski [3, p. 101]. If
K is specialized to an ellipsoid, then for d £3 only the basis (w;)
will occur.

3. Reduction to finiteness. In the search for critical lattices, we
first restrict the K-admissible lattices to the subclass having d inde-
pendent vectors on the surface of K. This is no restriction since every
K-admissible lattice can be contracted to a K-admissible lattice with
the further property. We then let (w;") be such a set of d independent
vectors. By the finite bases lemma, the lattice has as its basis a set
(2) chosen from among the finite collection in (2).

Then the conditions (1), subsidiary to the minimizing of the de-
terminant of the Qf, can be rewritten as ®( 2p: 7) 21, where (3)
are still all integral lattice points, not the origin and where equality
is achieved when the argument of ® is one of the vectors w.
= Dat a:;Q;, from (2). Now the convex body K determines a conjugate
convex body Kj in the p-space by means of the inequality in the pi:
®( Dp; {)') =1. Furthermore K, contains the 2¢-hedron determined
by the vectors + (ay, 0, 0, - - - ~0), £ (ay as, 0 - 0); =

one for each basis, and they contain the origin and hence a hyper-
sphere of radius ps, depending on d alone. To be more specific, using
the estimates ay - - - aa <d! and ¢;;2 lass] for > (an easy conse-
quence of (2a)), we find that for instance Pa2d=12(d!)~%2, Hence

Thus the system of inequalities (1) can now be replaced by the

In principle, of course, we select the basis whose system gives the
smallest determinant; and in each system we would have had to

change some inequalities to equality and to ignore many more.
When d> 3, however, there seems to be no easy way to determine a
minimal system.
