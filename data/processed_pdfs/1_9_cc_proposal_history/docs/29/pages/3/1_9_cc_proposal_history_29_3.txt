sory and 80 on. Therefore, if ONR decided not to
et 6345, directly, it would have to add about 100,000
che budgets of several other of its projects at ifr
4 them to cecontinue at their present rate; for each of these
ots, now getting frse time on WW1l, would have to contribute
_ir share divectly or not have the use of WWl. But such com-
gletely pieceneal supprrt is not healthy for continuous operation
of a facility like WWl. The staff is at the wersy of chance
flustuations of demarss and comsequently is often tempted to take
on purely commercial oomputing tasks, for cutside firms, to tide
over a slask period. ;

| S sted Selution for 1 1986 - The better solution
would be {o_‘lé%"fa make 168 cont® on in a single sum, 8o that
the various ONR projrets at MIT need not pay extra for WW1l time,
and then to sherge 7*he ncn-0NR, non-Linscoln, sponsored projects
enough for their ure of the facilitlies and staff so that Whirlwind
can afford to deveie some of its time to gencral educational re-
search without chirge. Such a system of charging has already been
worked ocut and h:3 been gone over with the ONR fiscal officers;
the charges are 250 per hour for machine time plus extra charges
for extra time of the programming staff and for extra use of output
equipment. (. present estimate of the number of non-ONR non-
Lineoln spor-ored projects willing and ghle to eontribute in this
way indica?:8 that we should be able to earn about $60,000 during
1955-195G6. Sueh support would, of course, be subject to the
flustuati ns mentioned above, but these fluctuations would now be
in a mip ity fraction of the total budget rather thin in the
major p&t, and hence would not be so large in magnitude., This
ameun’) represents a réduction in use of WWl by non-ONR projects,
pelcy the level of last year, because a number of thes2 projects -
-eganrot: efford to pay charges of this size undar thelr present
vy.geiis. In other words, the imposition of asuch charges will
grerense this type of work to about 1/3 of the total sponsored
sork (ONR plus other, not including Lineoln) done om Wil. It is
pissible thet this fraction will increase again as thece other
srojests cone to include computer charges im their future budgets,
but 35 is unl)ikely that much inerease will come in 1955-1956.

Projosed M%g - With this plan of operation, the es-
timated non-ﬁi oin cost for 1955-1956 is, as mentioned, about
161,000, of which about F60,000 should be made up by non-ONR,
aor~Lineoln DIC projects, leaving 100,000 to be born by ONR.
Buc it is now esiimated that projeet 6345 will sti1ill have about
170,000 ndetd by June 1955, so that an addit lonal gront of
