BCD

 

 

The BCD pseudo-operation is a hold-over from the 704 "SAP"
assembler and is supplanted here by the BCI pseudo-operation.
The BCD pseudo-operation is exactly like the BCI except

that the word-count always appears in column 12 and no sep-
arating comma is used (i.e. the second subfield starts in
column 13). A zero in column 12 specifies the generation

of ten words.

The VFD (Xgriable field gefinition) pseudo-operation is
used primarily for the generation of tables for use with
the 709 ''convert'' operations. Each VFD pseudo-instruction
generates exactly one machine word, but the subfields of
the VFD generate variable numbers of bits. Thus the basic
unit of information in this case is the individual bit,
The variable field of the VFD pseudo-operation is composed
of a variable number of subfields separated by commas.
Each subfield is of one of three types. These are symbolic-
expression, octal, and Hollerith (i.e. BCD). A symbolic-
expression subfield consists of a decimal integer giving
the length (in bits) of the subfield, the character "/"
and the symbolic expression (possibly a decimal integer)
whose value is to occupy the bit-positions indicated.

The expression is evaluated according to the rules for

the evaluation of expressions except that only the right

n bits are used, where n is the specified bit-count.

An octal (Boolean). subfield consists of the letter "O",
followed by a decimal integer specifying the bit-count,
followed by the character '"/'", followed by the octal integer
or Boolean expression to occupy the bit-positions indicated.,
A Hollerith subfield consists of the letter "H' followed

by a decimal integer specifying the bit count, followed

by the character '/", followed by the BCD characters to

be converted (six bits per character) and placed in the

bit positions indicated. Any valid character except comma
or blank may be used in a Hollerith subfield. The variable

field is terminated, as usual, by the first blank. The
