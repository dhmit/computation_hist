I would appreciate it it you could let me know of any

person who might be interested in taking such a position either
this spring or next summer, or in suggesting that sugh people
should write me directly. The salary we would offer would be
normal to universities, not as high as industrial positions, but
the man would have the opportunity or further class work and would
have contact with a wider variety or problems than in industry.
