of the relationship of computing to traditional mathematics seemed to cause some
of the problems For example there was a feeling that there was not sufficient
understanding or recognition of numerical anslysis which invoived sxperimental
technigues vsing a computer rather than theoretical analysis It was even ques~
tioned by one pansl mmember as to whether the relationsghip of computer science to
other fields such as linguistics was not as close as to the pure mathematical dis-~
ciplines

Several suggestions were made to improve the understanding of computer
science TFirst a comaputing ceanter staff with representatives from different
academic arsas might help spread the understanding of thie field At one university
this was accompanied by offering & apecial series of lectures on applications to
certain disciplines A second group of suggestions dealt with sloppy computer
housekeeping operation and sloppy documentation of distributed programs which
tend te discredit the field of ressarch itself. The proceedings of the Harvard
Switching Symposium of 1957 was given as an example of a responsible publication
There was a general feeling that the way to establish computer science was to do
creditable research deeds not words, that computer science was becoming recoge
nized and that we need not have a chip on our shoulder.

Three specific recommendations were put on record by the pansl as impor~
tant contributions to solving this problem:

1. THE CENTER SHOULD RESERVE STAFF TIME COMPUTING TIME, AND
BUDGETARY SUPPORT SPECIFICALLY FOR DOING COMPUTING RESEARCH
AND SUPPORTING COMPUTING RESEARCH BY OTHERS IN REMOTE AREAS
BUT WHICH WERE STILL PERTINENT TO THIS FIELD~ (IT WAS POINTED
OUT THAT THIS ACTIVITY DOKES NOT APPLY TO THE SMALL COMPUTING
CENTERS AS DEFINED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT IN THE PANEL ON
BUDGET AND ADMINISTRATION).

2 THE CENTER SHOULD DE IDENTIFIED AS A RESEARCH ORGANIZATION
RATHER THAN A SERVICE ORGANIZATION. { AT ONZ UNIVERSITY A
SEPARATE ORGANIZATION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIE ACTIVITY.)

3. EDITORIAL STANDARDE OF A HIGHER QUALITY WERE RECOMMENDED
FOR PAPERS SUBMITTED TO JOURNALS, AND SIMILARLY HIGHER SELF=-
IMPOSED ETANDARDS FOR PAPERS PRESENTED BY UNIVERSITY STAFF
AT COMPUTER MEETINGS, THIS SUCGGESTION WAS ALSO INTENDED TO
APPLY TO THE INTERCHANGE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMS AND REPORTS,

1. What T 8 of Activities The Organization Of Thege Can Be uely Iden~
tified And Developed With Academice Standards So That The © er Science Rew
gearch ¥ill Not Be Considered A Subordinate Function?

Gradually throughout the sessions, certain topics were identified by various
panel members with computer science, Although no extended discussion or classi-
fication of these followed, those topics frequently mentioned included:
