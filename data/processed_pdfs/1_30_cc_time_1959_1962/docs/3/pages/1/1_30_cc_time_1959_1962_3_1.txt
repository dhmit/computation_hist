COMPUTATION CENTER (D
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Cambridge 32, Massachusetis

 

Dear Sir,

Enclosed is the summary of computer ussge at the Ceanter for
your depertment for the month of January. It should be noted < Sl
~that this report covers only the brief pericd January 22 to
January 31 since the Center did not start recording oporations
with the 7090 until January 22, 1862.

Because the Center's new cosputer the 7890 is, on typical
problems, three times faster than the 709, the last figure reported
for cack problea "Total 7090 Use” includes only the time for this
period. It is felt that combining 709 time and 7080 time would
produce a meaningleas figure.

Except for these differences the form of the report is
similar to those you hed received earlier. Any suggestions or
comments you have concerning this report will be welcomed by
either Mr, Steinberg, the Operations Kanager or myself.

As additional information we are also enclosing & copy of
Computation Center Bulletin No. 20 which presents & precise
description of the Center's operating policies for the 7090.

Sincerely,

| 1) 64
