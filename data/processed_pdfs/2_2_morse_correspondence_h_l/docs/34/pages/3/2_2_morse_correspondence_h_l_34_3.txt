n and k are called the optical, ucoa and (e/e) the elec-
trical constants of the films.

To find the fundamental quantities ucoa and (e/ €0)
from Egs. (7) and (8), it is necessary to solve Egs. (1),
(2), (), (5) and (6) [or Egs. (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6)]
for n and % in terms of the experimental data for R (or
R'), T, m, a, and \. It is clear from the form of these
equations that no explicit function can be found for #
and k. Therefore, a series of successive approximations
must be made, trying a set of # and k, and computing
R (or R’) and T corresponding to this set of 7% and k.
The time required for each computation of R (or R)
and 7, on a desk calculator, from a set of # and & IS
about 15 hours; ten approximations may be necessary
to achieve the required accuracy. Therefore, about 15
hours per sample per wavelength are required by desk
calculator. If the radiation incidence on both metal film
and backing are to be considered, this number may be
doubled.

When the thickness of the metal film decreases, the
reflectance and transmission become less sensitiv’e to
the properties of the metal, and the index of the backing
becomes relatively more important, Therefore, the
accuracy afforded in » and % by experimental accuracy
decreases with decreasing film thickness, so that thé

and % corresponding to the probable error in the re-
flectance and transmission data. Uncertainty regarding
the density of the film also indicates the desirability
of repeating the calculation for various film thicknesses,
so that the need for a faster calculating medium is
clearly indicated. Graphical approximations have been
used by Murmann,® but even the use of these is very
laborious, and their accuracy decreases considerably
when the metal film thickness decreases.

Since 7 and % [and hence ucoa and (e/e)] depend
on four independent variables, R, T, (a/)), and n;, the
publication of tables with sufficiently small increments
is not practical for accurate evaluation of # and k.

For the above reasons, a program was coded for
WWI, an electronic digital computer at M.LT., as
described below. This program is designed to take data
in a form which can be supplied by anyone not ac-
quainted with electronic computers, and it produces
and labels the results in a convenient way for direct
use or publication. The techniques developed for
Whirlwind I will be described in a future publication.
For direct calculation of the optical and electrical
constants a program has been developed to find these
constants as functions of the reflectances and trans-
n'lission, film thickness, wavelength of incident radia-
tion, and index of refraction of a backing, if present.
Another program has been developed to compute the
reflectance and transmission as functions of the optical

constants, film thickness, wavelength of incident radia-

tion, and the index of refraction of a backing if present.
The latter program is used to test an estimated set of
optical constants; if the computed pair of reflectance
and transmission agrees with an observed pair, then
the estimated set of optical constants is indeed a correct
set of constants of the film.

II. APPROXIMATIONS IN THE INFRARED

A. Electrical Constants

Many backings, such as cellulose nitrate, transmit
nearly one hundred percent of infrared radiation. When

such backings are used, the calculations can be simpli-
fied by setting n; equal to unity. In the infrared a/A<1,
so in Egs. (4), (5), and (6) the following approximations?
can be made:

cos{ (2ma/\) (n+1k)}=21—3{2ra/\) (n+ik))?,
sin{ (2ra/\) (n+ik)}=(2wa/\) (n+1k).
These lead to the approximate equations:
A/T= (wa/N)*(ucoa)*+{14-2(wa/N)}ucoa,  (9)
where A =absorptance by the film
R/T= (ra/N*{ (¢/ €0) — 1}*+ (3ucoa)’. (10)

Woltersdorff® has derived similar equations. It follows
from Eq. (10) that (R/T)> (3ucea)?. Equation (9) can
be more crudely approximated by the relation ucoa
~(A/T). This leads to a lower limit to R given by:

RL(1—R-T7)*(47). (11)

Thus R and T are not entirely independent, but are
limited by the inequality in Eq. (11). This equation
has proven useful for a quality control of such measure-
ments on transparent films.

According to Eq. (9) the absorption per unit trans-
mission depends on the conductance but not on the
dielectric constant of the film. In Eq. (10) the con-
tribution of the dielectric constant to the reflectance
per unit transmission depends on the ratio of film thick-
ness to radiation wavelength. For a thin conducting
film in the infrared this contribution is very small com-
pared with that due to the conductance. Therefore the
contribution of the dielectric constant to the reflectance
and transmission of thin, conducting films in the infra-
red is minor. It follows that the dielectric constant
cannot be accurately determined by infrared optical
measurements, and that the conductance is the prin-
cipal physical property of the film determining its
optical behavior in the infrared. A crude fit of electrical
constants to a set of reflectance and transmission
measurements can be obtained by varying the con-
ductance alone. A fine adjustment can be made by
varying the dielectric constant.

Equations (9) and (10) are both quadratics. Since
conductance is always positive, only one root of Eq. (9)
is physically significant. Equation (10) has two solu-
tions for the dielectric constant, either of which may be
physically significant. According to Lorentz® and Zener?
the dielectric constant (e/€) and polarizability « for a
system of free electrons are related to frequency » of
the incident radiation, concentration »,, mass m, charge
(—e), and relaxation time 7 of the free electrons by the
expression

The polarizability of free electrons is seen to be
negative. When #n, and/or 7 are sufficiently large, the
dielectric constant becomes negative also. Therefore, in
the region of free electron absorption the physically
significant solution of Eq. (9) is the one in which the
dielectric constant is less than unity, and may be
negative. The behavior of bound electrons will be dis-
cussed in Secs. IV and V.

B. Optical Constants

Equations (7) and (8) can be solved for the optical
constants, to give

nt=3(¢/ €0)+{(3¢/ &0)*+[ (ucaa)/ (4ma/N T}, (13)

and
k= —3(e/e0)+{(G¢/ €)™+ [ (ucoa)/ (4ma/N) P}E.  (14)

These forms are the most convenient to use with auto-
matic computing devices. If (3¢/¢) is factored out, as is
frequently done, and (3¢/€)? is taken out of the square
root, either the positive or the negative root must be
taken, depending on the sign of ¢, in order to make »
and & real. While a person has no trouble selecting the
appropriate root, such discrimination has to be pro-
grammed for an automatic computer.

When a first estimate of the electrical constants has
been found by solving Egs. (9) and (10), these esti-
mates are substituted into Eqs. (13) and (14) for a
first estimate of the optical constants. For very good
conductors the assumption (ucoa)/(2wa/N)>>(e/€0)? is
often made. This leads to the approximate expression

Wk (ucoa)/ (4ma/N) =pcok/d4r.  (15)

It will be shown below that this approximation is not
necessarily valid for thin films. Yet it should be noted
that the approximate, and invalid, expression given by
Eq. (15) leads to the correct product of the optical
constants, namely

nk= (ucoa)/ (4ra/\),

which is equivalent to the exact equation (8). The
dielectric constant, on the other hand, would always be
zero if » is made equal to k. Since this is incorrect,
Eq. (15) gives the wrong dielectric constant and optical
constants but happens to correspond to the correct
conductance. It has been shown in Sec. II-A that the
conductance is the principal physical property deter-
mining the optical behavior in the infrared. Therefore
a whole family of optical constants obeying the condi-
tion nk=constant would roughly fit the observed
infrared reflectance and transmission, but fine adjust-
ment by means of the dielectric constant would be
necessary to calculate the individual optical constants.

C. Numerical Analysis

Equations (9) and (10) were tested on Whirlwind I
by solving for the electrical constants in terms of ob-
