The problem of financing the center is a very serious one in many universities,
It seems to be a fairly general opinion that eventually universities should consider the
computing laboratory on about the same basis that it considers a library, but no place
has reached. this admirable goal, Until that time, many universities which do not
have. extensive research programs are finding it necessary to seek contract work
outside th.e university, and apparently some of this work is in direct competition with
commercial service bureaus, One university has gone to the extreme of paying full

rental for the equipment and subsidizing a relatively small academic program with a
large service bureau,

I would like to hear more regarding your further contacts with Dr, Grad, I
would also like to repeat my invitation that the meeting be held here at Norman, We
are served by the Oklahoma City Airport and our own univeristy airport and in addition
have good rail connections to Chicago, We are certainly about as central as one
could get, and we will have a brand new computation center building ready in about
two months, Although we will not have our copy of the Rice Computer finished by
Spring we will be well on our way and we can discuss our future plans, We are
rather isolated from the main stream of computer activity, and such a meeting
would certainly be of great help to us, The university administration here has been
very enthusiastic about building up a first rate computer program, and has com-
mitted a significant part of its resources (considering its limited budget) to the
program, Since our most desperate need is competent people, I am sure we could
make valuable contacts and get good suggestions from the group of directors,

Yours very sincerely,
