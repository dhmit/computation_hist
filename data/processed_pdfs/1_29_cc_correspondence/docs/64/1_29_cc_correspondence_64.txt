Phone No,

 

 

Have you completed your problem?

 

If the answer is YES, how will you employ your results? If results are to
be published, please indicate: Author, Title, Journal and expected date of
publication, (Acknowledgement of the help of the Center is requested, as
wall as two copies of the reprint for use at the Center.) If results are
used in a Thesis, please list the Title, degree sought, Department and
Granting Institution,

 

   

If final arrangements for publication of results have not been made, indicate
your present intentions above and report to us again later when final
arrangements have been made.

If your answer to 2 is NO, this Report Form will also be your Request Form
for computer time for the nest quarter and you should answer the following
questions:

2) Fow much computer time will be needed to complete this problem?
b) What ig the expected completion date?

 

¢}) How much more machine time will you require for the next quarter ior
thir problem? minutes?

9, The sbstract and description of your problem, and the suggested classification,
which you provided for us on Application Form CCF-2, are used in our Frogress
nonoTts to describe your work, If these items have changed during the past
quarter, they should be brought up to date so that we have a correct version
of your present use of the Center. Consequently, £ill in the following with
NO CHANGE or with a revised version:
a) For cataloging purposes, how would you index this problem? For
exemple, mathematics, logic, game, etc, If this is a mathematical
problem, specify type(s) such as, integration, partial differential
eguations, matrix theory, etc.
ER a CE a ee an 2 a a AT OE SE Tran el,
pk) If this is a mathematical problem, specify numerical methods used,
such as, Gauss' quadrature method, difference equations, Crout, etc.

of how adequacy was determined. This description
should include, when pertinent, the number of signifi-
cant figures accuracy required at various stages of the
calculation and the ranges and values of the quantities
involved in sufficient detail so that program complexity
may be ascertained. In addition, indicate how you
tegted the programs and whether you have test cases
available.
