Dear Alan:

We have felt that it might be worthwhile notifying
the younger readers of the ACM Communications that there are
opportunities here at the Center., Consequently, if you feel
it appropriate, we should like to see appear in the news
column of the Communications a note of the sort given in the
appended sheet., â€˜

Is this okay?

S8ingerely,

Philip M. Morse
Director
