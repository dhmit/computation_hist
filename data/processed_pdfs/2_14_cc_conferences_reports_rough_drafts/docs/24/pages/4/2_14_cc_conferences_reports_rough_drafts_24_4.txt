Operation Tims of Mashine Components

 

The previously-mentioned manual on 705 provides the exact {ormulae which
relate the operation time of each component in terms of number of records involved.
Generally speaking, the card punch is the slowest uwnit on the machine whereas the
magnetic drum wnit is theo fasteste The following tebulation indloates the
epproximate times ¢

Card punch wnld = 00 ms

~ Card printing walt « 400 ms
Card reading wnit = 240 ms ,
Magnetic tape unit = 15036 ms
Magnetic drum = 11,20 ms

I have intimated that seversl control units must be utilized to convert from the
mechenical to the electronic units. Specifically, a control unlt is required to
convert from the card resder to the magnetic cores. Similarly, a different control
unit is reguired to comvert fram the memory %o the oard printer. Finally, a third
control unlt is r&quired to convert from the memory to the card punch.

The use of control units is intended to prov;ide a common language bond on all
types of IBM EDPM machines. FNor example, the peripheral equipment on the Type 701,
702, 704, end 705 mechines is identicel. It iz merely necessary to use a different
type of control unit on certain machines, IBM considers this common languege of
gomputer development %o be a most important pert of their computer development progran

Machine Instructions

The Type 705 machine employs a 6 decimal digit number to represent instruoctions
a8 well as sddresses. This permits the machine to modify both addresses and instru-
ctiong during the solution of a particular probleme. This is an important charace
teristio of any computer. More importont, however, is the faot that the magnetic
cores permit random access to the entire instruotion (5 decimal digit) in a come
plotely randome~access manners It is %his feature that is responsible for. the
great inorease in opsration spesd on the 700. |
