The grant to Stanford University will support numerical analysis, applica-
tion of computing machine methods to scientific problems and training of personnel
in the techniques of machine computing. Fields in which the computer at Stanford
has had wide use include statistics, mathematics, physics, engineering and bio-
chemistry.
