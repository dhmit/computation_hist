THE B.I.T, AUTOMATIC CODING SYSTEM FOR
THE I.B.M, 704

Abstraet

&n automatic coding system, which, it is hoped, will
be useful te novice and SxXpert coders alike, is being developed
for use on the I.B.M, 704 at the M.1.7, Computation Center., The
system is not yet in operation, but its underiying philosophy is
alveady clear, It is felt that the new developments embodied in
the M.I.T. systom will be of interest to others ai this time,
The principal features of this system ave:

1) The inclusiom of an advanced algebraic language and
of elementary machine code in one comprehensive coding system,

2) The provision for defining functions {i.e., sub-
routines) at will within the algebraic language, and the gepara-
tion of the defining process frem the computing process,

3) The use of symbolic addressing to facilitate the
interliaking of the algebraic and machine languages
