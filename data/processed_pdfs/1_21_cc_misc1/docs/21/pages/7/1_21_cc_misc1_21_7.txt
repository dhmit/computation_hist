MEMORANDUM
To: Mr, R, P, Webber, D, S.R, February 10, 1958
From: Director, Computation Center

Subject: Proposal to Extend Contract NSori-60 without Increase of Funds,

 

During the past year the persomnel of the Computation Ceamter
have been using two computing facilities; the Whirlwind I installation
in the Barta Building and the new IBM 704 installation in the new
Compton building, The work using Whirlwind bas beem supported by
contract NSori-60 and that using the 704 has been supported by other
grants, although the nature of the work is closely related. Now that
the Whirlwind equipment bhas been turned over to the Lincoln Laboratory,
the work of the Center uses the 704 equipment exclusively with consequent
inerease in effectiveness because work is now all done at one place,
using one machine, and duplication of office and machine operations is
eliminated, :

Work as described in task orders of NSori-60 continues to be
carried out by the Center, though now the 704 is used to try out the
programs and auziliary equipment rather them W.W. I, For example,
Amendment No, 13 (6/28/51) states in part:

"3, On and after 1 July 1951, section (a) shall read as follows:

(A) The Contractor shall furnish the necessary perscunel and
facilities for and, in accordance with any instructions
issued by the Technical Officer or his authorized repre-
sentative, shall conduct a coordinated research program
in applied mathematics utilizing facilities in the Center
for Machine Camputation, including the WHIRLWIND Coaputer,
which shall include but not necessarily be limited to the
following:

(1) research in methods of numerical analysis and the
formulation of scientific problems for machine solution,
together with the training of personnel on these methods;

(2) support of the scientific and engineering applications
group previously associated with Project WHIRLWIND so as
to make the WHIRLWIND Computer useful and available for
the above research, including a continuation of the
construction and improvement of the WHIRLWIND Computer;
and

(3) an investigatiom of digital computing machine components."

Work coming under sub-headings (1) and (3) of this amendment is
being continued by the Center,
