M.I.T. Computation Growth
A by :
Professor Herbert M. Teager

M.I1.T's needs for compucatioﬁ“have already outgrown the
available capacity of the 704. The underlying causes for
this disparity give every reason to expect that the situation
will worsen at an'inoreasing rate in the future. The outward
manifestations of the situation are threefold: first, a queue

l of programmers awalting a chance to run their problems on the
I TO4 has developed with a one to two day waiting time for
short runsj second, longer, more ambitious problems requiring
five to s8ix hours of straight running time cannot be easily
fitted into the tight schedule and are thus discouraged;
thirdly, in an attempt to minimize the lengthening queue
which adversely affects programmer productivity as well asto
equitably divide up a fixed amount of machine time among re-
quests which are as of now approximately 30 per cent above
avallable time, the center has resorted to a system of pri-
oritlies and percentage cutbacks in time allocations. That
this 1s not healthy cannot be denied, but there appears to

be no long range solution other than to provide more computa-
tional capacity, both through improved equipment and more
efficient programming systems.

The available time of the M.I.T. Computation Center must,
of course, be shared with the other New England Colleges, with
one shift of machine time nominally assigned to the other Uni-
versities. In the past, M.I.T. has been able to "spill over"
