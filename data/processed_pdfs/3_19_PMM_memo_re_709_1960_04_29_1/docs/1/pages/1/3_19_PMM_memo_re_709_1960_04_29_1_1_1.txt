SUBJECT: LONG RANGE COMPUTATION SYSTEM STUDY GROUP -
PRELIMINARY OBJECTIVES, ORGANIZATION, AND PLANS

Summary

A group should be set up to study the reole of computation
at MIT and surrounding research centers in order to recommend a plan
for future action of MIT to cover our needs in the next five or more
years, This study should be completed by winter of 1960,

A plan of approach has been developed, with recommendations
for staffing and support,

in the light of the past ten years of experience in high-
speed computation at MIT, it is time for a critical assessment of our
objectives with regard to computation - its role in our research and
education, both now and for the next five or more years; our needs
with respect to computation; and a plan for an orderly development to
meet those needs, including recommendations for the type of equipment
that should be obtained, and areas for further research and development
in carrying out such a plan, Such an appraisal, while primarily based
upon MIT, would im addition attempt to include the needs of surrounding
laboratories, to determine the desirability and feasibility of pooling
the resources of the area to provide a common facility to meet allied
needs,

it i therefore proposed that a group under the direction of
Professor Teager be chartered and organized to make this systems study,
The approach of this group will be divided into three phases: ()\\
