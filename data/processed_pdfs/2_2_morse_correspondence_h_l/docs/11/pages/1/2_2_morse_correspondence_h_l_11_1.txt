Dear Professor Morse:

I am enclosing a picture which is not
particularly a work of photographic art but
is at least of historical interest. I thought
you might like a copy of it.

I am looking forward with pleasure to
seeing you from time to time in the future
since I did enjoy my association with you
during the year that I was located in
Cambridge.

Sincerely yours,
W
