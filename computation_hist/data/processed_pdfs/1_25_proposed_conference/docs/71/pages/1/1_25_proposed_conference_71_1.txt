Dear Phil:

It is nice to hear that you are back and I hope you
enjoyed your travels,

Arthur Grad visited Brown some weeks ago and we had
occasion to talk about the proposed meeting. He is, as he
intimated to you, interested in supporting it if (as some-
thing useful is likely to come out for NSF, (b) there is
sufficient interest amongst computation centers.

Judging from the interest displayed by a good many
people at the ACM meeting, there is no doubt about the
second point. The planning committee had a couple of
luncheons during the meeting at M.I.T., where we were joined
by several other people, and each sub-committee will have
a report ready for you around October 15, based partly on
circulars, partly on intuition. A fifth group was formed,
consisting of Alan Perlis and Saul Gorn, to report on the
question of government relationsj; there has been much concern
lately about auditors' examinations of computer charges to
contracts and it was felt that a uniform policy on determining
these charges would be much appreciated -- a problem happily
absent from your Center.

I shall make an appointment with your secretary and
come and show you the correspondence which has accumulated
during your absence, none of which is frightfully important.

Best regards,

Sincerely yours,
Walter Freiberger
