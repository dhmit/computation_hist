    <h1>Floating Point Numbers</h1>
    <p>Computers such as the IBM-704 store real numbers in a format called floating-point.
        The floating point format allows computers to store and perform arithmetic upon
        numbers of diverse magnitudes with appreciable precision. A floating point system is
        defined by two numbers: the Base and the Precision (The base is sometimes called the
        radix).</p>
    <p>A real number represented as a floating point itself has two parts: a Significand and
        an Exponent. </p>
    <p>To demonstrate, let us examine how a number is represented with Base 10 and Precision 3</p>

    <h3>Please input a number and hit "Load Number":</h3>


    <input type="number" id="inputNum" value="0">

    <button id="load_number_operation" class="btn-lg btn-primary">Load Number</button>

    <h4>Your number is: <br> <span class="loadedNumber" id="loadedNumber_0"></span></h4>

    <p>This number would be stored as a floating point with Significand <span class="significand"
                                                           id="significand_0"></span> and
        Exponent <span class="exponent" id="exponent_0"></span>.</p>

    <p>This floating point corresponds to the number: <span class="reconstructedNumber"
                                             id="reconstructedNumber_0"></span></p>

    <p>(Note that there may be a discrepancy between your actual number and how it's represented.
        There is an error of the size: <span
            class="loadedNumber" id="loadedNumber_1"></span> - <span
            class="reconstructedNumber" id="reconstructedNumber_1"></span> = <span
            id="error"></span>)</p>
