"Purchased‚Äù Time on the WW1 Computer during the six-month
pericd July 1 - December 31, 1955.

 

In accordance with our discussions regarding ways and means
for financing the M.I.T. Computation Center involving the
704 cperation, I have prepared a Ffour=-page summary of "purchased"
time on the WW1 Computer broken down on a project basis.

It should be mentioned that the charge for the use of this
computer falls into a number of categories:

1. Guarenteed time charged at an.equivalent rate of
$3.205/hour of W1l time.

2. Regular charge at a rate of $4.167/houyr of WWL time.

Tom Crane, Research Fiscal Officer, and I will meet to discuss
& possible revision of the current billing procedure,

During this six-month period the '"purchased time" usage of
WWL breaks dewn as follows:

 

Aero-elastic Allocation Account 1028.1 $ 3,295.05
Servomechanisms Account 1065.2 3,413.56
Civil Engineering 480,0 1,538.40
Instrumentation Alleocation Account 1500.0 4,807.80
lletecrology Depariment 843.0 4,701.82
Geology Eepartment 833.1 2,670.08
Buerger 287 .4 921.13
Research Laboratory of Electronics 1080.0 4,500,377
Misc. non-guaranteed billings 1209.3  5,039.19
GHAND TGTAL 8326.1 $28,887 .50
The attached four~page summary provides a detailed breakdown
of the individual projects and sponsers involved. I think it is a
simple matter to be able to detexrmine which laboratory should
contribute how much for the 704 opergtion. X am looking forward to
discussing this matter at our next meeting on Tuesday, February 14.
