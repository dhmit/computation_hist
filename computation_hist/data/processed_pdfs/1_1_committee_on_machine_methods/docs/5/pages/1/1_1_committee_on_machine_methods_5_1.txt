Committee on Machine Methods of Computation
December 20, 1950

Eersens Eresent: G. S. Brown, a. Feshbach, J. w. Forrester,
Z. Kopal, C. Lin, P. M. Morse-and E. ﬁeissner

rhe deliberations of the Committee at this meeting were taken
up almost entirely with consideration of the cases of Verzuh and
Booton. The Sub-Committee mentioned in the last minutes reported
that they had talked to Verzuh and made two recommendations:

(a)~ That Verzuh not be asked to take a regular written
qualifying examination, but that his preparation
in his field be checked during the coming term and
Summer by taking at least one course in mathematics
(probably m39), that he start on his thesis researcn,'
particularly in its analytic aspects and that the
end of the Spring or during the Summer he take an
oral on two or three aspects of mathematics or elec—
trical engineering, which will be considered to be
. his official examination in the field of his major.
If he passes this examination and satisfies his
.superVisory committee concerning his course work in
mathematics and his preliminary research on his
thesis, he will he considered to be ready to com»
plete his thesis and take his final thesis examina—
tion.

(b) That, in the opinion of the Sub-Committee Verzuh
would not be able to carry on this Spring program
effectively unless ne.were given full time to work on
it. The Committee then voted that Morse should ask
Stratton whether it were possible to give Verzuh a
leave of ebsence,with pay, from his Job this Spring
so that he could carry out this proarem, and to
recommend to the Electrical Engineering Department
that Brown, Fesnbecn, Kepal and heissner be his
supervisory committee for his general Oral examine:
tion and for his thesis. Morse will report to this
supervisory committee and to the Electrical Engineer»
ing Department the result of his conversation with
Stretton.

Subsequent to the meeting, Morse saw Stratton and told him the
recommendations of the Committee. Stretton is_to investigate as to
whether Verguh can be given leave of absence this caning term, and
