APPENDIX B

SUMMARY OF FISCAL CHARGES

It has been our desire to operate the RDA for others on a2 non=-

loss, no=gain basis., To do this requires a credit of $100 - $120/day

for other work, We have also agreed to give up to 10% total time on thesis
or academic work free, The following is a summary of actual credits and
charges for none-Instrumentation Laboratory use:

During the period July 1950 = September 1950, we paid RDA
account no., 2349 $1732.15, based on the old method of charging,
even though we were paying two engineers and three machinists
for operation during this period. I believe that the proper
charge should have been about $8l5, This estimate is based on
the time of Mrs., Hogan, Mr. Goos, and one third of the time of
Mr, Versuh and Miss Tamm for one month « we used the machine
21.5 day3. . -

Since October 1951, Stevens Institute of Technology has used the
machine a total of 36.5 days. I believe a credit of approximately
$4000 should have been made to DIC 6783 (I.L. Air Force account
number for RDA)s Up until now, we have been credited with only
$2610, Anocther point is that billed at 100% industrial overhead
rate, the charge to Stevens would have contributed about $1500

to the Industrial fund.

Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratory
13 days of work done in January to March 1951
Desired credit $1500; actual credit #$330.

Mechanical Engineering Depte. (Prof. Kaye and Dr., Tung)

34 days - August -« November 1951

Desired charge about $3700; actual credit $2610

This difficulty was our own fault, We received some free con=
sultation from Prof., Kaye and the remainder was considered a
contribution to Dr, Tung's thesis,

Project Meteor

27 days = July = August 1950 « correctly charged by Instrumentation
Labe requesting DIC te transfer all salaries and wages for this
month to Meteor,

Credit $2008,53 plus 42% ($2850)

39 days « August = September 1952 « charges now in process of
clarification. No difficulty anticipated,
