Prof. G. S. Brown page 2 August 9, 1955

I have considered the qualifications of this
proposal in light of existing academic rules regarding
the establishment of a DIG contract, and I feel that
the project will contribute to our educational and research
program. As a matter of fact, it is not unreasonable to
expect that several theses may originate as a result of
this work. (I am currently supervising a programming
thesis which is very definitely of this character.) As
you know, I have been asked to take over Mr. Porter’s
assignment in the Digital Computer Laboratory, and in
this assignment I will be available to supervise this
effort. Finally, the existing space and facilities in

the Harts Building are available and adequate for the
conduct of this research.

I hope the above comments have covered all
pertinent items required for this contract negotiation.

However, if I can be of any further assistance, please
do not hesitate to call me.

Sincerely yours,

F. M. Verzuh
