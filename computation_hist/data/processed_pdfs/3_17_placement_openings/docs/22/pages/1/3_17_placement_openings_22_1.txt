Dear Dr. Jorgensen:

1 am pleased to enclose a check for $1, 200. 00 for the second
semester portion of the University of Connecticut appointments to the
M.1.T. Computation Center ae described on the attached sheet. The IBM
Corporation is very grateful for the work of the Research Associates and
Assistants in the program for they have contributed a great deal to its
success.

There are now thirty-four colleges and universities in New
England participating with M.I. T. in the Computation Center. The new
IEM 709 has been in operation for four months, and already seventeen of
the colleges have made use of it. For your information, I am enclosing
a table of usage for the months September - December, 1960.

I am delighted that the University of Connecticut continues to
be such a strong user of the Center at M.1.T., and I know that you are
looking forward to setting up your own Center on your own campus.

With warmest personal regards.

Sincerely yours,

M. Loren Bullock
University Representative
