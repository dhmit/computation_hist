. In addition to the solution of scientific computing and business
pProcessing problems, a number of classroom lectures were devoted to the
consideration and evaluation of the relative merits of thke many commevciglliy-
available electronic data processing systems. Specifically, this was achieved
by a study of 16 representative intermediate-size drmum computers, and seven
of the large-scale systems -~ BIZMAC, Datamatic 1000, ERA 1103, IBM 704,
IBM 705, Raycom, and UNIVAC, respectively. Since many of the students were
éntering various large business, industrial, and government concerns, it was
important that they have some knowledge of scme of the relative merits of the
individual systems. Finally, several lectures were devoted to the IBM 704

Calculator which will be installed in the M.I.T. Computation Center in the
near future.

it is apperent from the above list that the total gttendance in these 1l subjects
was 768 students. This doos nei mean, hoWever, that there were 768 individuals
involved since many of the students toock a numbeyr of the above subjects, thus the
actual number of individugs exposed te machine cemputation is consliderably less.
