APPROACH TO MARKOFF’S MINIMAL FORMS
THROUGH MODULAR FUNCTIONS

HARVEY CORN

The author considers J a sub-group of the modular group of genus one
corresponding to a fundamental “parallelogram" with rational vertices in tie
upper half-plane. Such a group J of linear transformations is actually deter-
mined to within similarity. If A and B are “generating” substitutions, (identi-
fying opposite sides), then ABA—18‘1 is equivalent to the substitution 2’: 2:6
and the fixed-point of A, are roots of Markoff’s minimal forms. This can 3e
shown by combining identities of Frobenius, (Uber die M mica/f Zahlm, Preuss.
Akadi Wiss. Sitzungsberichte, (1913). pp. 458487), with identities of Fric (e,
(Uber die Thean'e der automorphen M adulgmppm, Nachi Gesi Wiss. Géttingen,
(1896), pp. 91—101). This method can be modified to produce classes oi forms
with a minimum close to one—sixth (rather than one-third) of the discriminant.

The matrices in 1’ taken by themselves are of some interest since every
denominator in the modular group must occur in the corresponding linear
fractional substitution. Sample generators of f are 2' = (z + 1)/(z + 2),
z’ : (z i 1)/(— z + 2), z’ = (32 — 1)/z, etc. The fundamental domain can be
described in invariant fashion by the period parallelogram of the u-plane for

1(2) = [/»'(M)]2 = 4/304) + 1,
