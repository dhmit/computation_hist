O R tions. The person who comes would have 8 S 0re” to take

. 1f, for example, he wanted to event 211y get a doctor's degree,

 

he could workgtuthe.cantor‘ror»a'ynar'or so and then take a .
part-time Job while working for his: degree. e
R We have a wide range of problems‘troﬂ.those of language
translation to those of caleculations of nuclear characteristics.
~ We do not code the usual problem which comes to us, so these
persons'uouldbe engaged mainly in the special and interesting
roblems and in writing out programs rather than detailed coding,
‘?although there may be exceptions). AR 0 2 | .
1 would appreciate 1t if you could 1et me know of any
person who might be interested in taking such 2 position either
this spring or next summer, OF in suggesting that such pepple
should write me directly. The salary we would offer would be
normal to universities, not as high as jndustrial positions, but
“¢he man would have the opportunity of further class work and would
have contact with a wider variety of problems than in industry.

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse
