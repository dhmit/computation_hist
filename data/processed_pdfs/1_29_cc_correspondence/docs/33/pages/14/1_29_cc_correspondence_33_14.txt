C. Simple A0P or SAP-Regular Run Conversion to KMo

There are two possibilities in this case: (1)
convert the whole problem into lMortran source languiage, or
(2) lconvent -certain seetions to AP subhprogramns and the otheis
intoe Fortransuhprograms .

The first case wmay seem dliflficult at first to
those who have not used Fortran, but many computational problems
are described easily in Fortran. Another factor to consilder
for those who have been using UABDCl for output 1s that the
Format specification in Fortran is identical. The number of
mathematical subroutines written for use with Fortran has
recently lnecreased greatly; thus, in many cases the original
motivation for using machine language coding has been removed.

in example 1is presented of a simple program that

"

was SAP-coded on the 704 and may be converted to FAP and

Fortran subprograms for the 709.
