‘Professor Caldwell of our Electrical Engineer -Depart-
ment tells me that your plant is getting an IBM number 704% machine
this fall and that there may be some free time on the machine at
first, which might be available for us to use for pure research 1
and/or education. Since there is some indication that IBM will 4
make a TO4 available to us about fourteen months from now, we y
would certainly welcome a chance to get acquainted with a 704% 3
this year, so we could develop our sub-routines ahead of time. i
I would be glad to see you here at Tesch to talk this :
over, if a visit here happens to be convenient. If it is, please :

call my secretary, UN4-69C0, extension 857, to arrange a time.

If this is not convenient, Dr. Verzuh and Mr. Arden, of our staff, :
will be glad to come to Lynn sometime to see what arrangements can |
be made.
Thank you for your offer of cooperation. :
Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse, Director
