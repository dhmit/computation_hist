II. Trapping (continued)

- Transfer type instructions that violate the bounds as
such are not trapped. However, as mentioned above, all
"1" cycles are checked so a trap will occur on the first
instruction after a transfer that violates the bounds.

A "1" 4s put into position 17 of location 32 when this
occurs., |

% The effective delay in execution and protection against
I/0 Traps is extended if the instruction following also
provides a one instruction grace period. It is expected
that a normal exit from the wonitor will be: |

ENB A
SPM B
SRM C
TRAÂ® 32

until
No I/0 traps will occur/after the TRA has been executed.
The protection and relocation will begin on the"1i" cycle
following the TRA.
