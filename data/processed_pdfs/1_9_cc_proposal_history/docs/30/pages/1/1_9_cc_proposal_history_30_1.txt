REQUIREMENTS FOR ELECTRONIC COMPUTING EQUIPMENT FOR
TRAINING AND POR EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH AT THE INSTITUTE

A Report to the Administration, from the Institute

The Problem - It is becoming epparent that high-speed elec-

fronic computers "are here o astay". Industpial concerns are

now planning thelir use to mechanize data gathering and re-
cording and for automatlic control of many processes. In
some technical fields the use of such machiries has becone a
commonplace part of engineering calculations. Scientifis
research in some fields, hitherto avoided because of their
complexity, is now belng prosecuted, using machines for
theoretical calculation and for data procesgsing. By the
end of another decade a general understanding of computer

of engimeers and regsearch scientists. Alreéady the airerzsft
manufacturers are requiring that the engineers they hire have
such knowledge. .

In view of this rapld development 1t 18 importunt,

education, that students be given the opportunity to leain
the characteristics of the various types:of computing machines
they are likely to use and to learn how they can be used by
actually using a few. At the undergraduate level this may
not require the addition of a special course. The Aeronanti-
cal Engineering Department, for example, believes 17 can work
in the necessary training and use as & part of one or mMOYrd
of their regular courses, though apecia,l‘;»elective courses
should be available for those atudents wishing to get more
than the minimm training. At the graduate level several
courses should be avallable, ranging from training in the
mathematics of mumerical analysis to courses in the detalls
of machine design. Basic ©o all of this training, hovever,
is the requirement that the students have access o aectually
operating machines. Details of operatliom, which would take
hours of discussion in a clagssroom, are quickly apparent to
the student if he has the opportunity to rcode, set up and
operate a machine.

A less specific, but perhaps more jmportant need
for machine tims is for thesis research and for the gereral
research program carried out by the faculty, which engenders
