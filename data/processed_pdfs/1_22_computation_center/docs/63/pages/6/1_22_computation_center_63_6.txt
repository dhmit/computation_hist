H’ gation is in the application of machine techniques to library
| inventorying, cataloguing, and record-keeping. Although special-
burpose machines wilj probably be required in the end, many ideas and
procedures can be developed and checked out on the general-purpose
machine at the Center with the addition, perhaps, of some specially
built input ang output equipment. The staff of the M.I.T. Libravy

C. Perhaps the most promising line of advance,Abecause the
least investigated up till now, is in the field of social science
experiments, where the computer can be used as recorder, sScorer
and referee, é@; Tactical situations in warfare are already being
studied by "gaming techniques" at Rand and in other military operations
research groups. Similar faesdead problems in various fields of the
social sciences can also be studied by Simplifying the situation
down to some sort of "game" with more or less co%aicated rules,
which can be played by groups of investigators, ﬁo see what are
the consequences of various strategies. If the "games" are to
correspond, even distantly, to some actual social situation, the
rules must be quite complicated and the scoring will require a great
deal of statistical computation. It has been found that only by
the use of computing machines can the scoring be speeded up suffi-
ciently so that enough games can be run through to provide an over-

Such "gaming techniques" are closely

oriented groups. The use of a properly programmed computer would |
provide such experiments with a powerful and flexible means of

changing, controlling, and analyzing these experiments in social
psychology. In this field we could work in close collaboration

with the Center for International Studies at M.I.T. and with the
