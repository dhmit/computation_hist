all machine shop stock and RDA spare parts (total cost .2970). we also
agreed to finish a vector table to conplete RDA obligations to another
Air Force contract. However, we have never handled all of the charges

to non-Instrumentation Laboratory users because of linited understanding
of our authority. Both Prof. Horse's Conittee en amputation and Mr.
Verzuh have worked most cooperatively with us in snaking decisions, but

we have not pressed our views where honest differences of opinion existed.
The EDA performance of our work has been so excellent and Mr. Vex-sub has
worked so hard in our interest that it would have been very unfair to have
done otherwise. However, there is still some confusion in our minds as to
the proper charging for non-Instrumentation Laboratory usage. Also, Hrs.
Hogan's resignation and Mr. Verzuh‘s possible shift of responsibility are
additional factors that make it necessary to understand the responsibility
clearly so that changes can be node as needed and approved by the proper
persons. Unclear separation between RDA and Statistical Services and con—
tinned use of the old Electrical Engineering Department account #23149 for
RDA would seem to be the basis for any differences of opinion that exist
on fiscal matters.

Section 2,0 INSTRUMENTATION LABORA'KJRI REQQWTS FOE EDA

Calibration for new uninitions and tactics of sigxts designed by
Dr. Draper and now in service require use of the RDA. In addition, our
current contract calls for development of improved sights, and the solution
of the kinnatic equations involved require use of RDA.

The machine is unique in its demonstrated capability, and all
proposed alternatives have either failed to handle the problem or are yet
to be demonstrated. Past efforts have been made with Harvard's Computation
Laboratory; current efforts are attempting to apply Whirlwind to the problem.
Instrumentation Laboratory is devoting the effort of two full-time engineers
to devising and testing other machine nethods.

In the meantime, we feel that in order to execute our current
obligations, we must have the continued use of the RDA. In the absence of
a definite proven alternate, we are very anxious to be assured of the use
of the analyzer for at least two years. It is further suggested that the
situation be reviewed at the end of the year, at which time more infomstion
on alternate methods should be available. Appendix G contains a more detailed
description of the technical phases of the calibration problem.

Section .0 HECOMEENDATIONS FOR FUTURE USE
l. Reassign primary responsibility to the Instrumentation Laboratory.
2. Have Mr. P. Cusick approve fiscal arrangements for non-Instruments:-
tion Laboratory work. Proper billing can be handled very simplyo

All Instrumentation laboratory persons are now charged to DIC #63h6
and allocated out at the end of the month, according to information
