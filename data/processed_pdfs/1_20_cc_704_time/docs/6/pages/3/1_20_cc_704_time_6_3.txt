Dr. Philip Morse -2~ March 22, 1957

to 11:30 p.m. The ASR operators will work from 11:00 psm. to 45 a.m.,
thus covering a portion of the UNIV machine time. This permits the MIT
operators to leave before midnight and make their transportation connections.
For the preliminary two-shift operation, it is suggested that the first shift

be manned by MIT operators and the second shift by ASR operators, so that
full MIT employment can be postponed for the time being.

To facilitate efficient usage of the 704, as well as to promote close
cooperation among the groups concerned, we recommend that the attached
schedule be used only to establish a top priority for any given period. Hence,
if one group is not able to fully utilize its available 704 time, a second group
standing by will be able to go on the machine.

In closing, we wish to express our desire that regular meetings of
the ASR and UNIV groups be scheduled to discuss common interests in the
operation of the MIT Computation Center.

Very truly yours,

Pl Sad
