The existence of such a limit is suggested by the next section which
indicates the connection with the Eisenstein series. The proc;f of its
existence requires the major portion of this paper.

tion of a specific “perturbation circle’’). Although the modular-
function methods are quite classical, critical use is made of the more
current idea of variation of the boundary.'

2. The perturbation map. We consider the perturbation caused
to the fundamental domain Dy by removing the portion above the line
Imz = 1/e (e < 1). The remaining (finite) portion, 9., is mapped
by the modular group z — 2" (of equation (1)) onto a portion of the
upper half z-plane, II, , which is constructed by removing from the
upper half z-plane the interior of a circle called C,/,(¢), tangent to the
real axis at p/q (%1/0) and of diameter ¢/¢°. (For consistency, “the
interior of Cip(e)” denotes the region Imz > 1/¢). Thus II. is
a simply connected region of the z-plane, snvariant under the modular
group. (See Fig. 1.)

We now define ¢ = ¢.(2) to be the mapping of II, onto the upper

imself.

Then, letting ¢ — 0, we should have the approximation

or, reducing the general term, we should find

Rather than justify the approximation directly (even on the
assumption that the limit (6) exists), we shall give what we hope is a
more revealing verification by deeper methods, more characteristic of
the theory of modular functions. In the meantime we observe, term
