Dear Dr. Weyls

In accordance with our telephone conversation last week,
I an sending you our most recent estimate of plans and sosts of
operation of Whirlwind I for the next two years. This can be taken
up in two parts: the one coneerning the operation of Whirlwind I
and the support of its necessary maintenance, programming and ad-
ministrative staff (DIC project 6345); the other ccmcerning the
general research and training program designed to extend the use
of digital ecomputers in scientific and enginecering researsh at the
Institute (DIC projeect 6915).

Projest 6915 - Taking up the second part first; the goal
set up in our proposals to OlR; to make faeulty and students

awvare of the usefulness of high-speed digital computers by investi-
gating applications in many fields, is well on its way to attain-
ment, Graduate students and faculty supervisors in most departments
of the Institute {Blology being the major exception) have investi-
gated applications of machine methods to problems in thelr own
fields and are in the prosess of obtaining results worthy of pub-
lication in their own field®s journals., This part of the program
was originglly set up for a yearly budget of £100,000, but the

rate was reduced to 80,000, at the request of ONR, before the
project had reached 1its originslly planned full strength. It is
now estimated that about F70,000 will remain in the budget of this
project by June 30, 19553 consequently, it will be able to continue,
at about its present level of activity, for only one further year,
unless further funds are provided.

But it is guite possible that most of the gims of sush
a general reseerch program will have been attained by June 1956
