Dear Professor Morse;

I have just been informed by Mr. Charles Baker in
Ossining that approximately seven people from IBM plan to
attend the December 20 meeting on nSimulation' and other problems
in Operations Research. About three of these will come from IBM
Applied Science and the remainder from Mr. Coombs' group in
Operations Research. They will arrive at the Computation Center
and will meet you in your office at the Center at 9:30 a.m. on
that day. I have already informed your secretary, Miss Hill, of
these arrangements.

The IBM representatives are looking forward to this
meeting with your group.

Very truly yours,

ek
