Dear Professor Merse:

At one of our recent meetings ve discussed the subject
of various reports which I write from time to time -- on warious
subjects regarding the Computation Center, administrative activities,
financial information, etc. The attached list includes the principal
reports which have been issued since January 1, 1956.

You have received copies of some of these already. If you
are interested in receiving any of the others, please let me know. In
the meantime, I merely want you to be aware of their existence.

Sincerely yours,

F. M. Vefzuh
