arrangement which would be followed, he agreed that such a program would
probably be feasible, and his staff is now considering their degree of
participation in anticipation of Morse's inquiry regarding this matter.
Gregory then described the subject entitled "Managment Information Systems"
which is to be offered for the first time during the Spring Term 1955.
Hurd felt that this subject precisely satisfied I.B.M.'s desires in this
area and was most enthusiastic about it. Hurd again expressed his desire
to see a summer session course offered in which the 650 would be used for
active student participation. He felt that a subject covering a greater
length of time-- perhaps the entire summer -- having fewer lectures and
more student laboratory sessions would better suit his interests.

In conclusion, Hurd stated that he would determine whether a 650
could be assigned to M.I.T. (in addition to the one which is scheduled for
the Instrumentation Laboratory) in June, 1955 to assist with this program.

In the meantime, of course, appropriate M.I.T. personnel are to determine

too whether they wish to offer such a subject at that time. He then pointed
out that no official action could, of course, be taken by I.B.M. regarding

the 700 Series antil the official proposal had been received from M.I.T.

Hurd informally asked Verzuh to carefully examine the relative advantages

of the 701 and 702 computers from the M.I.T. application standpoint in order
that the best machine be selected when and if the occasion arises. He further
emphasized that I.B.M. would welcome havzgéTﬁ.I.T. personnel spend any amount
of time they wish at Poughkeepsie actually working with the machines to
develop data processing techniques.
