Continuation of Contract N50r106001 (D.I.C. 63u5 and
6915)beyond current expiration date for the period

1 July 1955 through 30 June 1956

0.N.R. Contract N50riO6001

In accordance with conversations with O.N.R. represen-

tatives in Washington and Boston, we recommend applying to O.N.R.
for an additional 530,000 to supplement expenditures of Projects
63u5 and 6915 for 1955-1956, so they may be continued at the

agreed—on

level. Project 6915 will be tapered off next year. It

probably will have about $70,000 unexpended of funds already a110-

cated and

its part of the budget will be about this amount, so no

more is needed for this part of the work.

Project 6)#5 (WW1 operation) will have an increased

budget next year of about $160,000, caused by the considerable
increase in the use of WW1 for pure research, by groups in all
Departments of the Institute. The increased cost of this increase

in aid to

research work will be borne by instituting a system of

charges for machine time to those non-0.“.H. projects at M.I.T.

which can

afford to help, in accordance with a procedure which has

been approved by O.N.R. It is estimated that the "income“ from
these charges will be about $60,000 next year. In addition, about
$70,000 will be left unexpended, of funds already allocated to

 

5345, by 30 June 1955. whis leaves $30,000 to be requested in
new funds. The details of the combined budget for the two projects
