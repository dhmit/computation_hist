arrange parking space for them? They wish to do the following

things while here:

construction).

2. Hear discussion on how machines might be used
in wilitary planning. I'll talk about war
gaming, somebody should talk about the logistics
use (transportation, etc.
%, Have a chance to ask questions about 1 and 2.

5. See Whirlwind.
They will leave about 4 p.m. or before.
Will you let me know, by October 23, what order these five
things should be in and who should take part, sSo we all won't
be tied up all day with them. For example, 1T would be nice

1f they could see the movie and W¢ from 2.30 to 4.00 so we
could attend the seminar.
