Dear Phil:

Perhaps you remember that on June 3, 1957, I called you re-
garding Dr. George Karreman, of the Institute of Muscle Research,
Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, Massachusetts. Dr. Karreman
was visiting me, and telling me about the molecular orbital calculations
which he is carrying out, and for which he needs computing facilities. As
I told you, these calculations seem to me to be the sort which our goup 1is
interested in, and I should welcome seeing them carried on on the 704.
As I understand it, the arrangement by which New England universities
can make use of the 704 would not apply to Dr. Karreman, since his Institute
is not a university. However, it is a non-profitmaking research institute,
and it seems to me that it would be suitable, if it could be worked out, for
him to have the privilege of making use of 704 time. _
