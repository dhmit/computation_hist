dipole. If one dipole was located in the left vgntricular area and the other in
the right ventricular area, the effect qf each dipole could.usgally be observed
on the anterior wall of the thorax section. These results. indicate that vector-
cardiograms should be supplemented with chest leads in order to obtain as
complete information about the heart excitation as possible.

The external field of two half shells in the heart area in the thorax section
was very similar to that of the resultant d.ipqle. .

Since the thorax section was almost elliptical in shape, mathematical ex-
pressions were developed for the potential due to a source and sink inside an
ellipse. A much simpler equation resulted for potentials on the outer bound-
ary of the ellipse. .

The distribution of potential araund the outer wall of the three-dimensional
thorax model was obtained at about twelve horizontal levels for all possible
spatial angles of the dipole at 30° intervals. By compgring §imilar human
thorax-potential distributions with the tank charts, a rapid estimate could be
made of the heart-vector orientation.

Since such distributions give the potential at all points on the thorax, they
make it possible, together with the limb leads, to test any system of vector-
cardiography. Equations are given for the projections of a spatial dipole in
terms of its absolute magnitude and of its horizontal and vertical angles.

Using a circumferential chest belt with small, closely spaced electrodes,
evidence of local excitation in the chest-lead diagram can often be seen. It is
pointed out that the amount of local-excitation effect recorded depends on the
size, number, and spacing of electrodes, on the recorder amplification, on the
individual studied, and on the instant of time during the cardiac cycle.

I am indebted to the late Samson Wright and to W. F. Floyd of the Physi-
ology Department, Middlesex Hospital Medical School, London, England, for
the frequent conversations that gave me an insight into certain aspects of
physiology that could have been acquired in no other way. Thanks are due
also to members of the staff of the Electrical Engineering Department, Imperial
College of Science, London, particularly to Willis Jackson and to Dennis
Gabor, Colin Cherry, and A. R. Boothroyd, and to Allan Gordon of the Mathe-
matics Department for advice on the problem of the ellipse. I also thank
Hans H. Hecht for his cooperation in more recent phases of the project.
