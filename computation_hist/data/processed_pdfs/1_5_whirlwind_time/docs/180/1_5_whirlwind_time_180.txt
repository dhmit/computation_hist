bear Sir:

I have been authorized to credit your
scoount with 25 hours of machins time on tho Whirlwind
IL computer for the compmte!ion of integrals essentisl
in auantum-mechanical computations on molecules and
sollds.

If you find that mere computer time 1s need-
1

ed, it will be necess.ry that a new request be submil-
ted.

I hope that these arrangements will prove
esatisfactory.

Sincerely,
