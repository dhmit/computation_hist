2. CONDENSED SYMBOLIC NOTATION

Condensed symbolic notation 1s a variant of the notation read
by the SHARE aszembly program UASAP, with which the reader is as-
sumed to be familiar, and which we shall refer to as standard
symbolic notation.

The first character of a condensed symbolic instruction is a
digit from 1 to 8. If the digit d is between 1 and 6 it indicates
a SHARE symbolic instruction in which the first non blank column
is column d, If the digit is 7 the location field is blank and
the first non blank is in column 8. If the digit is 8 the first
non blank is in column 12. The instruction is then written con-
tinuously with no gaps. For all instructions and pseudo-instruc-
tions except BCD and REM the condensed instruction ends with the
first blank and the next instruction follows immediately,

EXAMPLE: The program A CLA X
STO Â¥
TSX FN,L
3
would be condensed to 6ACLAX T7STOY T7TSXFN,lL 83.

In the case of a BCD instruction there is no blank at the
end since the digit in column 12 tells when the instruction ends.
REM instructions are ordinarily suppressed by the condensation
program., However, the programmer can insist that an REM instruc-
tion be Included by putting a digit d or an X in column 6, in
which case d six character words of remark will be included in
the condensed symbolic program, where X denotes 10,

Another feature of the condenser program is that for all
instructions but the HED instruction, if the location field is
less than 6 characters it is pushed as far to the right as pos-
sible to save space in the condensed program.

Condensed symbolic programs can be produced in two forms -
as cards and as library programs on a tape. In the card form
the condensed instructions run continuously through columns 1
to 72 of the card. An instruction may have part of it on one
card and part on the next. A revision of UASAP which will read
