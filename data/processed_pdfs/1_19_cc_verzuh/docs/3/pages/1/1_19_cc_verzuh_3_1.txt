Dear Truman:

1 have completed the floor layout plans of the EAM room
in the basement of Bldg. 26 and now realiZe that we probably do not
have an adequate number of verffiers in our plans for the Computation
Center. You will recall that the original decision regarding EAM
complement was made by Messrs. Hurd and Mason prior to your appoint-
ment as educational representative, and at that time we had: one key
punch and one verifier in the installation. During the summer you
and I discussed the key punching requirements and increased the
number to the present total of six.

 

At the present timc in our opsralion of Whirlwind, we have
the fellowing equipment:

Group Equipment
Professional Group 3 Flexowriters
3 Verifiers
| 1 Comparator
Self-Service Unit 3 Tape Perferators
3 Verifiers

1 Comparator

If we were to attempt to extrapolate from the Whirlwind operation, it
would appear that we need more verifiers. 1In view of the delivery of
verifiers, I would like to suggest that we place an order for two (2)
