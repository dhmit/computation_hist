Dear Dr. lLelmani

vour letter of 7 May has aroused sone interest here.
We have been planning to spend some time developing machine
techniques in the social sciences &s We build up the Computation
center here. Already sone of the staff are worklng up techniques
for application of linear programming and other related theories
to problems allied to the ones you mention. Perhaps the enclosed
deseription will give you an idea of some of our plans.

 

 

Since we are primarily an gducational and pure research
institution, our work will not be classified and the important

results will be published in the usuti scientific Journals.

7 understand your ietter, this would not be a barrier TO our Wwork- |
| ing on basic personnel problems Lor you, however. \

After further discussions with the staff I will write
you in more detall. In the meantime, I would welcome hearing
your reaction to the enclosure and learning a bit wore as to the
nature of the contract you nave in mina (nature and frequency of
sur reports, whether the contract could be for several years, etc.) \

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse, Director
