Dear Dr. Morse,

Thank you for your letter of the thirteenth which I
received today si‘ter being out of town for a few days. I
spend almost as much time in Philadelphia as here, with
the possibility of having my Philadelphia mail remailed
to Washington in such a way that I lose out at both ends.
Your note was honored in this manner.

I have no immediate plans to be in Boston. However,
if none materialize fairly soon I will try to make the trip
anyway. I will keep you infomed of w schedule.

Sincerely,

gilxw

Ezra Glaser
