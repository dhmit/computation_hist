for the past fiscal period showed a credit balance. The
important thought behind this discussion is the fact that
the evaluation of an equitable rate structure does involve
Variables whose magnitudes must be estimated. Since they
ca not be accurately estimated in aE;;;:;:.trere is a
possibility of error. For example, the estimated distribu-
tion of overhead costs given in Table i is subject to error.
Since there 15 no previous operating experience available
for the CFC, the estimated distribution of supervision and
administration charges may be in error. (It should further—
more begoted that the #1797.75 cost of capital equipment

is a doe—time charge associated with the CFC).

In conclusion, it is evident that a close check on the
operation must be made and at the end of, say, six months,
the rate may be readjusted if the observed operational
conditions inoicate that this is necessary.
