. lnouoyoumnot awvare of it, lmldukotouu your
attention to the 704 program which we are setting up at MIT, and in

particular, point out to you the cooperative program which exists
between Yale and MIT on the use of the 704. ‘Specifically, Professor
Woerksom has been appointed as the Yale MIT representative and you
should contact him rogarding details of this program, The important
thing, however, is that you will be able to use the 704 machine ag soon
a8 it is available (January 1, 1957?) at no charge. I, therefore, suggest
that you become familiar with the 704 coding and the 704 classes which
are te be held this summer and fall at lﬂ'. Again, Professor Woerksom
has complete information on this. ~

I am looking forward to seeing you here at the Institute ueing
the 704, In the meantime, if we can be of any help, please let us know.

S8ingcerely,
