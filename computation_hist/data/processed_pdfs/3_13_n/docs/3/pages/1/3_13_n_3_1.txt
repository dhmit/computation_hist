COMPUTERS HAVE NOT MADE HUMANS OBSOLETE!

By Dr. Harvey Cohn, Head, Mathematics Department
University of Arizona

In appreciating the role of computers in society, either inside or out-
side the university, it is important to know their limitations. Limitatioms
of speed, capacity, dexterity, etc. are almost meaningless with today's ex-
cellent electronics industry. Yet one genuine limitation exists: machines
can not create new ideas. They can only execute ideas preconceived by the

human, more faithfully than the human.

The inability of machines to create is simply a result of the type of
design common to all computers and a result of the utter reliability of the
operation! This limitation need not dampen interest in computers any more
than the barrier presented by the speed of light need dampen interest in de-
signing missiles. It would still be better to think of the machine as what
Ashby called an intelligence amplifier. Thus a user of a machine is like
an executive with a staff of specialists whose objective reports make pos-
sible a decision. While we may at present content ourselves with being
thankful for what computers can do, nevertheless limitations will ultimately
become objectives,

The inability to ''create new ideas' (beyond the ingenuity of the user)
is perhaps subject to semantic disputes if we try to define our terms pre-
cisely. Yet a more truly rigid mathematical limitation is also present. The
mathematician indeed enters the picture in a negative way when he is not us-
ing the machine as an intelligence amplifier. There is a well recognized
theorem in mathematics that NO UNIVERSAL ALGORITHM EXISTS: there is no pro-
cess for solving all problems by machine (or by any humanly executed rigid
decision process either).
