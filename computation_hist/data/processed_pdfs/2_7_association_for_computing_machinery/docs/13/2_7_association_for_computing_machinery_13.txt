The IBM Corporation recognises that your resesrch and educational
progrsm in the laboratory of Chemical end Solid State Physics is extremely
signiﬁcant for physics and chemistry. We also realise the: your long-range
plans for computing will not satisfy your éemsnds in the immediate months.

As an interim and partial solution to your needs during the next
twelve months. IBM is pleased to offer to you up to two hours Per day of
IBM shit: time at the MJ. '1‘. Computation Center during the period June 1,
1969 to May 31. 1961. This oﬂsr will be contingent upon the availability at
time after the normally echeﬁuled IBM shl£t runs are completed. The
avelhbility and scheduling at such time can be arranged through my office.
This otter should in no way affect your obtaining computer time in the
normal manner during the MA. '1'. shift time.

We make this time available to you as a recognition by IBM of the
