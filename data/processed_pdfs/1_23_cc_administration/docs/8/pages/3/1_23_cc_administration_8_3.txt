& BDowne Buppress preparation of logical tape 2.
& Up: Suppress printing of library subroutines.
& Dow: Library cvbroutines taken from the library tape are printed.

Operator's Check List:

if necessary, mount the library as logical tape 3 and the SHARE AS-
SEMBLER a5 logical tape 1.

If the symbolic deck (or decks ) have beer writtenm on tape, mount
this tape as logical tape 6,

if any off-line output is desired, set logical tape 2 and rewind it
Banuaiiy, |

Remove 21l punched cards from the on-line punch.

Load one properly made up calling deck for each assembly to be'donc.
(8e¢ paregraph on calling decks).

After the last assembly is done, remove logical tape 2 for off-line
Printing; that is, if there was any off-line output. (There will be one file
for cach assembly whose output was off-line). :

Remove the binery decks from the on-line punch. (Blank cards will se-
parate symbol tebles from binary decks and one binary deck from amother).

Calling Pecks:
The calling deck for an assembly normally consists of three cards:
MI GET SAP (8Bpecial calling card to read in SAP from tape 1)
1) UA B8AP 150 (Normsl first pass transfer card) |
UA SAP 258 (Normal second pass transfer card)
If the symbolic deck is to be read on-line, place it between UA SAP 150
and UA AP 258,
“he calling deck 1) above causes zbsolute binary cards to be punched
on-line. If relocatable binary cerds are desired, replace UA SAP 258 by UA SAP
2 NQ.

1f it is desired to punch 24 words/card, replace UA SAP 258 by UA SAP
2 EH,

If it is desired to write 2 binary tepe (logical tape 5) rather than
Punch binary cards, repiace UA SAP 258 by UA SBAP 2 WT. In this case UA ZCS82
