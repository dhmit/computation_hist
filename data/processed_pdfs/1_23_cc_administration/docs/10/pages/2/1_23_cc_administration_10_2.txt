It must be emphasized that the breakdown of MIT usage is some-
what inaccurate. Specifically, many problems are described as faculty
research, educational theses, and "DSR sponsored” on ome and the same
problem application form CCF-2. I have called 2 number of the individual
sponsors seeking a clarification of the classification in order to fit
the above Table I breakdown. In many -cases I am not certain of the accuracy
of the breakdown (As I mentioned to you, certain projects emphasize

educational thesis work, thereby hoping to avoid any DSR payments at a later
date -- if any.) ot »
