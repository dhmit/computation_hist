Dear Professor Morse:

I have been in the process of trying to make up my mind about
the future, and mainly as a result of your advice and council have
just decided to accept the directorship of the University of North
Carolina Digital Computer Laboratory at Chapel Hill.

This means that I will start trying to get things orgadnzed
beginning in February, and that therefore I will be unable to be
at M.I.T. the second semester. I am very sorry about the latter,
because I know that there is a great deal I could learn at your
laboratory. I certainly appreciate the invitation and your patience
with me in giving you an answer. Perhaps we can begin an informal
exchange of personnel later on between Cambridge and Chapel Hill.
If at present you have any graduate students that you would like to
recommend to come into a very free, easy, and wide open situation,
with plenty of room at the top, I would be pleased to hear your
suggestions. We will start collecting our staff in February, and
our emphasis will be on any and all mathematics related to the use
of computers, from automatic programming and logic at one end to
numerical solution of partial differential equations at the other.

Thank you again for your kindness and patience. I will come
to see you in person on my next trip to Cambridge.

Sincerely yours,
/ pions C aN
