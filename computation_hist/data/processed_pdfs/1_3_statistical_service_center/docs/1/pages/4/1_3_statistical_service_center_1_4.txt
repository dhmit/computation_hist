I hope you will find it possible to all" us to use the analyzer for at
least two years and that the fiscal arrangements suggested will be satis-
factory. To correct any possible false impressions, I would like to re-
emphasize the excellent cooperation of both Hr. Verzuh and Prof. Horse's
Committee. In general, we have been very happy in our use of the analyzer.

Our concern for clarifying responsibility and future use took a sharp up-
turn when Dr. Stratton mentioned a few weeks ago that the Institute was
considering giving the machine to the University of Texas, presumably
because we did not wish to continue supporting it. This was clearly a
misunderstanding, and we are anxious to avoid repetition of this type of
concern.
