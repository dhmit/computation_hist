Dear Corby:

Thank you for your letter of November 24 and for bringing me
up to date on the current status of the IBM Resear ch Appointments at
MIT. We will certainly see that these changes are reflected in our
checks for the second semester.

We are arranging for a simplification of this procedure which,
I think, will be helpful to all concerned. In the future it will be sufficient
for you to send information about the IBM Appointments directly to Mr,
Bullock, who will arrange for the distribution within IBM and for the
proper checks and letters to be sent, This procedure should speed
things up considerably and make it more convenient for everyone,

Sincerely yours,

M. A, Shader, Manager
