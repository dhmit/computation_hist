Peay Dy. Shader:

We were very pleased to have a chance to report to Mr. Watson
and the others of your party ot our progross. The suggestions you
made will be of value to us and Mr, Watson's indication of his
continued support is encouraging.

As we pointed out then, we find, from time to time, that we
need suxiliary equipment, or small modifications of the 704 itself,
in order to make the machine more useful to ite users, Une example
of this, sentioned briefly at the meeting, is the addition of the
so-called Real Timo Package for the 704 main frame, This addition
would enable several £.E. students to use the 704 for their Ph.D.
thesis work in communications, which otherwise would have to be
done on some outside machine, or not done at all, There are
indications that, once installed, it would be continually useful,

in cesses like thie, I feel Ait only appropriate that the
Institute contribute toward the additional cost of these wodificn-
tions, thai IBM not be asked to contribute move than you are already
contributing. But I wonder whether it is fairy to ask the Institute
to pay the same price for the modification thai IBN would charge its
commercial customers. Would it not be poseéible, for example, for us
t0 pay IBM the actual cost of the real time package, rather than
cost plus profit?

I would be glad to talk over this problesm with you in the near
future, to see whether we can work out a mutually satisfactory


package installed hore,
studenis.
