Dear Mr . Morse :

We should like to thank you for working with us in arranging our
program called ELECTRONIC COMPUTERS FOR PROBLEM SOLVING of my 21-2—3.

We sorted out pretty carefully the different authorities on various
computer subJects that were suggested to us. We found that we had the
makings of several computer conferences, each one of them better than
any one conference attempting to draw the best of these men together.

Accordingly, some of the best of these suggestions we hope to obtain
for later programs. This first program mentioned will be mostly
orientation or information about computers for problem solving. Later

programs will get into continuous application, and then others will
take up operating considerations, and etc.

We do appreciate your having helped us put together the beginning of an
interesting series.

Cordially yours ,
