‘““Dear Professor Kiddle:

I am sorry not to be very hopeful about being
of help on your data classification.  The new equipment

fio be installed at M,I.T. by I.B.M. is primarily for the
" use of the New England colleges and it now appears that it

wlll be kept busy by students and faculty of these instil-
tutlions right from the start.

You might write mwe agaln some time during the
summer, when we have had a chance to seec how things to,
but I cannot be sanguine about our ablllity to help you
even then.

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse, Director
M.I.T. Computation Center
