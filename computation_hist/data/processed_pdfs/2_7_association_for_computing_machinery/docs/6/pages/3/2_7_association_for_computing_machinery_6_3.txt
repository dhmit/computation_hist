When one attempts to solve s problem on a digital computer
one often finds it necessary o furnish the machine with a great
sany values of some well-imown analytic funetion, There are essentially
two ways to do this. (me technique 18 to read the values from a table
of function values kept in internal storage during the computation,
Alternatively, the values of the funetion may be generated, as needed,
by the computer., In either ease, 1t is desirable to compute all
function values internally.

connection with the solutions of the spherical Bessel equation. it
tusne out that in the case of these functions it is possible to

 

forsulate a wmethod of goneration which 18 particularly well adapted
for machine use, The method &8 based upon the use of recurrence
relations which are guite gimple in form, thereby being easily coded,
and yet give high numerical aceuracy throughout the range of order

and argument met in most applications, The use of recurrence relations
implies, of course, that the method would be most efficiently utilized
in those caleulations where one requires the value of the funetion

for meny different orders at gach specified value of the argunent.

The purpose of this paper is to show how the PeCUrrence
relations nay be used in a straightforward manner for generating
in 8 dizital eomputer the various types of spheriecal Bessel functiond.
