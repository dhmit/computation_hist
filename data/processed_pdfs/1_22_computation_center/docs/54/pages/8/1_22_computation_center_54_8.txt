Title of Position: ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING ANALYST

DESCRIPTION

An EDPM analyst may have a different background depending upon the particular EDFM
operation. For example, if the EDPM operation is primarily one of data processing,
the anplyst should be skilled in methods and procedures, work flow methods, flow
charting techniques, time motion studies, ¢c. On the other haend, a systems analyst
in a scientific computing center should be well versed in mathematics and numerical
analysis.

The duties are similar to those of the programmer except that the analyst is expected
to delve more deeply into the basic mathematical statement -- performing certain
mathematical researches and developing suitable numerical methods for solution.

QUALIFICATIONS
