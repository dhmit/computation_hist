Although when under Moni tor control, a FORTRAN compilation,

if desired, will produce row binary cards, the only cards

acceptable for Monitor execution are columnar binary. All

non-Monitor, hand-coded subprograms to be used must have

correct associated program cards in proper columnar binary

form.

Program Limitations.

a. Care must be exercised on jobs involving both compilation

or assembly and execution to avoid overlapping of program

and common data. Overlapping
is permitted. If common data
will be bypassed.

b. A list of missing subroutines
or the chain links of a job.
a diagnostic print-out occurs

the chain bypassed if a chain

of program and BSS control

overlap occurs, the job

is accumulated during a job,
If more than 50 are missing,
and the job is deleted, or

Jjob. The maximum number

of transfer vectors that all levels may have in a single

job or chain link is 250.
