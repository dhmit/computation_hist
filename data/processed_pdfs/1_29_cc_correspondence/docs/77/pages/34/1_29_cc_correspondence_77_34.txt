be listed. The LIST pseudo-operation causcs listing

to be resumed after an UNLIST,; if UNLIST is not in
2ffect, the LIST causes one blank line to appear, but

has no other zffect. Normally, and after a DETAIL
pszudo-opzration, all the machine cards generated by

the generative pseudo-operations will be listed. (The
gencrative pscudo-operations include BCD, BCI, DEC, OCT,
DUP, and CALL.) The TITLE pseudo-operation causes
suspension of listing of the words, other than the first
word, generated by these pseudo-operations until a DETAIL
pseudo-operation 1is oncountered. That is, when TITLE

is in effect, only those lines will be listed which cor-
respond to cards in the symbolic program deck. Note that

DETAIL is the normal mode.

Thz location field of a list-control psceudo-operation
is ignored as in the variable field except in the case
of SPACE. The list-control pseudo-operations are not

themselves listed except for UNLIST.

The normal mode of output for a relocatable (FORTRAN-type)
assembly is column-binary cards that will be punched off-
line. No off-line binary output for a relocatable assembly

is produced if an error has been detected.

In an absolute assembly, binary output is produced even

if errors have been detected.

Row-binary and column-binary cards may be produced on-
line if appropriate FORTRAN Monitor Control Cards precede

the FAP Monitor Control Card.
