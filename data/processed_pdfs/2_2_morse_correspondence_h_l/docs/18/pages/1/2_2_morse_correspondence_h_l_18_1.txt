Dear Mr. Weiner:

. Aq pregent national chairman of the Joint Computer Committee,
I am writing to invite the Eastern Joint Computer Conference and
Exhibition to hold either ite 1959 or 1960 comventiom in Boston.

1 think the 1955 conference with its attendance of 1250 people
clearly démonstrated that Boston is a suitable site for such a conference.
I am therefore advocating that we seriously consider making Boston omne of
the permanent sites for the rotational plam currently used for site
location. I am sure you are aware of the growing concentration of elec~
tronic industrial development in the Boston area -- we have two UNIVAC's
in Boston, one 704 end a second 704 will be imstalled in the new
MIT Computation Center in February of 1957. The experience 1 obtained
during the 1955 Bastern Joint Computer Conference will make it much easier

to run the succeeding meeting here. 1 have made preliminary checks regarding

local interest in such & meeting, and find it most enthusiastic! As a
matter of fact, I am enclosing letiers of invitation fxom the following
individuals:

Christian A. Herter, Governor, Commonwealth of Massachusetts
John B. Hynes, Mayor, City of Bostom

Ernest Henderson, President, Boston Chamber of Commerce

E. C. Sherry, Manager, Convention and Tourist Bureau

which indicate the widespread interest in having your group meet with us
in the near future.

1 shall, of course, attend the 1956 EJCC and would like to attend

the National Joint Computer Committee meeting to extend this invitation in
person,
