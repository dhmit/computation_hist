In addition, the programmer can use the following logical

numbers for personal tapes with his program:
- Physlcal-Logical
A =529
B5 - 10

VI. Case Studies of 704 to 709 Transitions

To assist programmers in preparing programs for the 709,
a series of the more common situations will be analyzed. These
case studies which have been prepared by Miss Marjorie Merwin
of the Center Staff do not exhaust all the possibilities but
should serve as a gulde to the factors which must be taken into
account. Any conversion problems that do not appear to be
covered here may be discussed with Miss Judy Spall of the Center
Staff (Room 26-153, Ext. 4114).

In the following examples, an arrow indicates a change
because of the transition.

No ma jor difficulties in conversion from the 704 to
the 709 confront the Fortran user whose decks are completely
in FFortran Source Language. In general, only a recompilation
is necessary.
For efficient running within the FMS Monitor System,

it 1s advisable to prepare the proper Monitor cards and revise
the source program for complete tape-to-tape operation.

1. The present END card should be replaced by
one with only END on it, and the Monitor
control card LIST should precede each source
