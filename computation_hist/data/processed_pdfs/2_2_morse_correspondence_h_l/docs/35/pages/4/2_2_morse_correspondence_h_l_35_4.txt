IV. LATTICE DISTORTION

It is proposed that in spinels the lattice distortions to
tetragonal symmetry are due to covalent-bond forma-
tion whereas those to orthorhombic symmetry are due to
cation ordering in the octahedral sites. In Sec. A, below,
there is a discussion of the distortions due to ionic order-
ing. In Sec. B there is a theoretical discussion of tetrag-
onal distortion due to coplanar covelant-bond forma-
tion and an application of the theory to CuFe;O4. In
Sec. C both models are applied to spinels containing
manganese. Experimental observations are shown to be
consistent with the covalent model. In Sec. D it is pro-
posed that the indates and metallic indium are also
distorted by covalent-bond formation.

A. Lattice Distortion and Ionic Ordering

Since 192922 it has been known that magnetite
(IFe304) undergoes a phase transition as the temperature

the temperature range 118.9°K <7°<119.9°K 822 After
Verwey and de Boer! had determined that Fe;O, is
inverse, Verwey® suggested that below the transition
temperature the Fe** and Fe*t ions in the octahedral
sites are ordered in alternating planes perpendicular to
the ¢ axis. Above the transition temperature disorder is
produced by the movement of electrons between Fe+
and Fe** ions. The transition temperature is low be-
cause the transition is electronic, rather than ionic.

If the lattice distortion below 120°K is due to cation
ordering in an ionic lattice, it should be possible to
calculate the ordered-phase lattice parameters from a
knowledge of the ionic radii. Verwey predicted that a
tetragonal distortion would result if there was an
ordering of Fe** and Fe®t cations into alternate planes
of octahedral, or B, interstices. Such a distortion would
be possible only in a purely ionic lattice in which the
tetrahedral, or 4, site is distorted as shown in Fig. 1.
The generality of this distortion for all tetrahedral sites
is apparent from the representation of the spinel struc-
ture in Fig. 2. Although, as was first suggested by Bick-
ford,* orthorhombic symmetry will result if the tetra-
hedral site is not distorted as shown, there is no obvious
reason why, if a purely ionic model is correct, a distor-
tion to tetragonal symmetry should not occur provided
the oxygen-oxygen separation is V2a(1—e)>2.64 A.

The cation-oxygen distance depends upon the size
of the cation. If the Fe**— (0O~ distance is a(1+4¢) and
the Fe**— (% distance is a(1—{’), then the distortion
