to pay for the machine time they need; we are here concerned with
the growing educational requirements for machine time, which will
be unsatisfied unless some means of financing machine operation

can be devised which does8 not make the machine a satellite of some
DIC proJject. :

In categories a, b and Â¢, high-speed computing equipment
has become Jjust as necessary as a machine shop is for experimental
research and for educaticnal training in some fields. The Institute
must somehow provide, as a standard aid in educational research, a
combination of computing machines, with input and output equipment,
plus a maintenance and programming staff, in a space adequate to
handle student training. The computing equipment should include
2 high-speed digital machine (equivalent to Whirlwind I or one of
IBM's 700 series) and a slower-speed machine (like the IBM CPC or
650) for preliminary training and for certain simple computing
tasks.

Present Situation - At present the Institute has the necessary
egquipment, in two separate establishments, precariously financed
for only one more year.

Whirlwind I was built by ONR, and the Navy has contribu-
ted $200,000 a year to make it available 40 per cent of the time
for general research. The rest of the time has been used up by
Project Lincoln, which has paid for maintenance, operation and
further improvements. Lincoln now has its own machine and will
need Whirlwind I less and less; the Navy feels 1t has contributed
enough and will contribute for only one more year. In fact,
Whirlwind will not be able to keep running next year unless it
charges for some of the computing it does. The rate, calculated
to keep it running on an austerity basis, has to be about $250
per hour. This rate will, of course, be 8o high as to put the
services of Whirlwind out of reach of graduate students and ordi-
nary faculty members, and only the wealthier DIC projects will be
able to afford it if it wmust finance itself entirely by such
charges. '

But Whirlwind is not a complete computing center by it-
gelf. The rest of the needed equipment, the punched-card machines,
are run by the Institute Office of Statistical Services, with a
separate staff. This organization also has had to charge for
much of its computing services, to the Inatitute's aduninistration
and to DIC projeects, squeezing enough out of them to be able to
afford to carry out a few thesis and other educational research
calculations free of charge. The M.I.T. administration pays about
$16,000 per year of the cost of this Office, in return for which
the Office handles student registration, alumni office and other
sdministrative computing services.
