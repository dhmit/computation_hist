Dear Professor Morse:

I have your reproduced letter to Dr. Grad of NSF. I am

in particular agreement with the four general areas that

you have described. I hope that, with or without NSF support,
sanething can be done to help give a feeling of more solidity,
common knowledge that others with the same problems are
trying to solve them too, and an attempt at making +the area
more acceptable to other parts of our university's. (Maybe
you might ask some deans, chairmen of departments, and
research professors to tell us what they think a computer

lab should be--or would we be grossly down-heartened by the
answers?)

Please call on me if there is anything I can do.

Sincerely yours,
W. Ceanv il

John W. Carr, III
