Dear Allen:

During the Chicago conference you suggested that the
report of the Conference should be printed in the Communications
of the ACM. I'm taking you up on this offer and am enclosing a
copy of the offlclal report, the main section, not including the
numerous appendices. Many of the Panel Chairmen got together at
the IBM session at Endicott this week, went over the report in
detall, and agreed that it was ready for publication, and that
it would be most useful to print it in the Communications.

Copies of the complete report will go to all the
conference participants and a number more will be prepared, for
extra requests. But there may be a use for reprints of the main
part, without the appendices. Can you send me prices on 300 and
500 reprints, so we can declde how many to order? It also would
be helpful if you could let us know which issue of the Communica-
tions it will appear in.

Yours,

Phillip M. Morse
