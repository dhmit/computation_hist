END OF FORTRAN DECK

in its statement field,
The translation phase will assemble the FTN deck and do the

following:
(1) Record the resulting FORTRAN1 relocatable binary deck in

column binary form on the PUNCH OUTPUT TAPE,
(2) Record the FORTRANl storage map on the PRINTER OUTPUT TAPE,

(3) Translate the FORTRANl relocatable binary deck to an abso-

 

 

 

lute binary deck and record it on the BINARY INPUT TAPE, This translation
is identical to that which would be given by the standard FORTRAN1 reloca-
table loader,

The title contained on the FTN card may be used on appropriate
direction cards during operation time to refer to the binary deck on the
BINARY INPUT TAPE, However, no symbol table is associated with this deck,

The user chooses the various options available in FORTRAN1 by
placing suitable control cards immediately after the FTN title card and
before any source program cards, Under normal conditions (i,e,, no control

cards) the compiler does the following:

(1) Punches on-line the resulting FORTRAN1 relocatable deck in
row binary form,
(2)

(3) Performs a relatively fast compilation without index regis-
ter optimization,

Records the SAP listing on the PRINTER OUTPUT TAPE ,

Exceptions to the normal case are obtained by inserting control

=, Normally it is illegal for two decks assembled by the transla-
tion phase to have the same title; however, the fact that a PMD deck and
a program (SAP, BIN, or FTN) deck have the same title is of importance
during the operation phase, When this occurs the twb decl;s are associated

so that when one refers to the title during operation time; one refers to

both the program and the post-mortem. The exact meaning of the associa-

tion will be described in Chapter 3. At this point, however, we shall
give the formal rules for association since it occurs at the end of trans-
lation time, ‘
(1) If a program deck and a post-mortem deck have exactly the
same title, then the post-mortem deck is associated with the program deck,
| The term, title, as used in this section refers to the trans-
formed title described in section 2.1, Thus the post-mortem deck
PMD M100-5-1%*01
would be associated with the SAP deck
SAP M100-5-1%1

(2) If a program deck, or a set of consecutive program decks

&
having the same title except possibly for the last three characters ( dldz)

is immediately followed by a post-mortem deck having a blank title, then

the post-mortem deck is associated with all of the program dec
