Â£223 25 Overhead: The suggested overhead is larger than most NSF
grants. in the present case, however, the research is intimately
dependent on the functioning of a large computing center, most or

the support of which will beborneby other sources. It is necessary
and appropriate that NSF contribute, to some extent to the operation
of the Center, the services or which this Project will use continually.
There is no simple procedure for itemizing this cost as a direct
charge, so it is included as an increase in the usual overhead.
