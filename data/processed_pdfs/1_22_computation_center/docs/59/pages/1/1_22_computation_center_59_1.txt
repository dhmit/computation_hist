HISTORICAL SUMMARY

This report is the beginning of a new serles of
Progress Reports, on the activities of the MIT Computaticn
Center in education and research in the general area of
the utilization of high speed digital computing equipment
in sclience; engineering and management practice.

Previocus Activity at M.I.T. - It is not the first
Progress Report on the subjeet to have been issued at MIT,
for the Institute has had a long history of aectivity in
the construction and utilization of computing equipment.
Por example, in 1936, the first model of the Bush Differen-
tial Analyzer was put into use at the Institute; many problems
in physicÂ¢s and engineering were sclved with its help. In
(see FV) the more accurate, electronically controlled
Rockefeller Differential Analyzer was put into use. During
World Warr II it was of great assistance in solving many
sclentific problems arising out of war work. In (see WWfiles)
construction was started on & high-speed digital computer,
which came to be called Whirlwind I. Desizgn and construction
was supervised By Dr. J. Forrester and the work was financed
by the ONR, under Contract No.

Whirlwind I came inte operation in
Although most of its activity has been in support of the
Alr Defense Project now consolidated in MIT's Lincoln laborae-
tory, up to 40% of ites time has been avallable to staff and

students at the Instltute, for general research. The machine
