Abstract: Prograins that lcarn to modify their

cvm bechaviors require a way of representing
algorithms so that interesting properties and in-
teresting transformations of algorithms are simply
represented. Theories of computability have been
based on Turing machines, recursive functions of
integers and computer programs. Each of these has
artificialities which make it difficult to mani-
pulate algorithis or to prove things about them.
The present paper presents a formalism based on
conditional forms and reccursive functions whereby
the functions computable in terimis of certain base
functions can be simply expressed. We also de-
scribe some of the formal properties of conditional
forms, and a method called recursion induction for
proving facts about algorithms.

Computation is sure to become one of the
most important of the sciences, This is because
it is the science of how machines can be made to
carry out intellectual processes, We know that
any intellectual process that can be carried out
mechanically can be performed by a general pur-
pose digital computer, Moreover, the limitations
on what we have been able to make computers do so
far seem to come far more from our weakness as
programmers than from the intrinsic limitations
of the machines, VWe hope that these limitations
can be greatly reduced by developing a mathe-
matical science of computation,

There are three established directions of
mathematical research relevant to a science of
computation, The first and oldest of these is
numerical analysis, Unfortunately, its subject
matter is too narrow to be of much help in
forming a general theory, and it has only re-
cently begun to be affected by the existence of

The present paper is an attempt to create a
basis for a mathematical theory of computation,
Before mentioning what is in the paper, we shall
discuss briefly what practical results can be
hoped for from a suitable mathematical theory,
This paper contains direct contributions towards
only a few of the goals to be mentioned, but we
list additional goals in order to encourage a

~ gold rush,

1., To develop a universal programming
language, We believe that this goal has been
written off prematurely by a number of people,
Our opinion of the present situation is that
ALGOL is on the right track but mainly lacks the
ability to describe different kinds of data,
that COBOL is a step up a blind alley on account
of its orientation towards English which is not
well suited to the formal description of pro-
cedures, and that UNCOL is an exercise in group
wishful thinking, The formalism for describing
computations in this paper is not presented as
a candidate for a universal programming language
because it lacks a number of features, mainly
syntactic, which are necessary for convenient
use,

2. To define a theory of the equivalence
of computation processes, With such a theory
we can define equivalence preserving transfor-
mations, Such transformations can be used to
take an algorithm from a form in which it is
easily seen to give the right answers to an
equivalent form guarantced to give the same an-
swers but which has other advantages such as
speed, economy of storage, or the incorporation
of auxiliary processes, '

4, To represent algorithms by symbolic ex-
pressions in such a way that significant changes
in the behkavior represented by the algorithms
