Dear Dr. Verzuh:

On November 21, 1956 we received an authorization for
the use of 50 hours of machine time on the Vhirlwind I
computer for problem 273, Analysis of Air Shower Data,

Since that date we have been using thls time at an
average rate of about 13 hours per month, and at the present
moment there is a deficit of about four hours in our account,
In the meeting of February 4, 1957 concerning the use of the
70% Calculator we projected our requirements on the basis of
10 hours per month on Whirlwind I, and this estimate still seems
to be a valid one on a long term basis. However, special
requirements of 2 gtudy on the distribution of «-mesons in
alr showers have temporarily increased the number of showers
we must analyze, so that our computation load has been above
our predleted average and it will continue to be so for the
next two months.

On thls basis it appears that we shall require 50
additional hours on Whirlwind I in order to continue our data
analysis during the next four months. I wish to request that
this amount of time be allotted to problem 273.

Sincerely,

Bruno Rossi
