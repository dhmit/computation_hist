Reference: Contract N§ori—06001

Dear Sir:

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology submits
herewith s'revised proposal for extension of the reference contract
to June 30, 195? at an additional estimated cost of $20,960.00.

We understand that this proposal has been the subject or diacus~
sions between Professor P. M. Morse of MI? and Hr. A. J. ﬁles

of ONH~MIT, Dr. Carl F. Mukenhaupt of ONE-Boston, and Dr. F. J.
Weyl of ONHmWashington.

There follows a summary of expenditures and funds
remaining on the two projects, Whirlwind Operation and Machine
Methods of Computation, which are currently active under the
reference contract:

 

; Project #624: (Whirlwind Operation) has an unexpended
: balance of $97,000 as of November 30, 1955. The current expend—
itures are approximately $10,000 per month. The'svsrage "income”
received for Whirlwind usage is approximately $3,000 per month -
a net expenditure of $7,000'per month. If it is assumed that the
present level of income ($3,000 per month) is maintained during
the nineteen—month period December 1, 1955'to June 30, 1957, a
minimum amount, assuming some tapering off, or $119,000 will be
required during this period.

However, for the purpose of establishin ’sn estimate or
unexpended funds on this project as of June 30, 195 . it is esti-
mated that a higher level of income will exist during the remaining
seven months. This may aversge'something shove $4,000 a month. On
this basis we estimate that $57,000 of the $97,000 mentioned above
will remain unexpended as of June 30, 1956. An additional factor
affecting the budget shown on page 0 is the estimated Computer
Income for the one—year period ending June 30, 1957. For this period
only $18,000 in Computer Income has been estimated. This is in-
fluenced by two factors: one being an expected tapering—off of the
use of the Whirlwind machine by other projects, and secondly the
expected beginning of operations under the IEM Type 700 machine.

Project #6 1 (Machine Methods of computation) has an
unexpended balance of ,000 as or November 30, 1955. The current
expenditures are approximately $7,000 per mo'th. If it is assumed
that the present expenditures remain constant, there will be a balance
of approximately $22,000 on June 30, 1956. In accordance with our
present'plans'for terminating the ONE support of this project on
June 30, 1956, there will be certain additional costs extimated at

$7,000 associated with the closing out of this project including such
