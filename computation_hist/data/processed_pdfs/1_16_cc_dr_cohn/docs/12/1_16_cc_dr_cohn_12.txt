10. Introduction to Part II. The 'most interesting cases of stable lattices,
introduced in an earlier volume of this Journal (12), were the (algebraic) mod—
ules of stable norm, or modules whose ratio of minimum absolute nonmero
norm t0 lattice determinant (1e, to the square root of module-discriminant)
is a local max1mum for small variations of the basis We soon found that these
modules were perhaps more numerous than we should have desired if we were
interested only in ﬁnding an absolute maximum. Nevertheless stable lattices
acquire a certain amount of intrinsic interest once we reach the stage where the
caniinuou: variable concept of “neighborhood of a lattice” leads to algebraic
Criteria of stability. In both these respects the situation displays some similarity
to the more classical subject of extremal (quadratic) forms (2) i

If the module in question is the module of all integers (i.e., the so-called
integer-module) of a [vial/y real ﬁeld of degree n, then the criterion of stability
depends on the relative signs of the conjugates of the units. This is a specializa-
tion, (weaker when n > 3), of the classical concept of “(maximum) signature
rank 2"," used by \Vel)er (13) for instance. We shall merely show, as a signiﬁcant
illustration, that the integer-module of the totally real ﬁeld KN : R (cos 21r/N),
over the rationals R, has stable norm (except for a few small N).

If we consider ﬁelds that are not totally real, the classical problem of signature
rank becomes vacuous for the imaginary (conjugate) ﬁelds while the stability
criterion that we use becomes more complicated. We shall, however, demon»
strate a reﬁnement of the “unit star” method of Part1 (12; p. 265), to obtain a
criterion that can be readily used to test more general modules. We shall carry
this through the cubic case,

The big difﬁculty arises when ”too many” roots of unity occur. We shall,
therefore, consider as a ﬁnal example the integervmodule of the cyclotomic
ﬁeld K” : R(exp 21ri/N). This module turns out to have a stable norm if and
only if N is square-free. This result, which essentially uses the presence or ab—
sence of a normal basis for KN, should further attest to the algebraic aspect of
stability,

modules of a totally real normal ﬁeld K, then the criterion of stability (of the

We shall verify this just in a typical case, N = N1. Here all we need to show is
that for a given non-trivial automorphism S, a M = M1 exists for which
9 = 91 is positive and 615 is negative. Thus all we need show is that ior any

gé i1 mod N1, (for which (g, Ni) = 1), there exists an M1 (for which
(M,,1\’1)=1), such that M1 lies in the range —%N1, ﬁNl),'while Mg 15

an M, is assured from the fact that the possible values of M (i.e., the non-
i.e., the multiples of 1)) , that the values oi Mg

multiples of 17), have such few gaps (
cannot always ”straddle" the range (sNi, %Ni) modulo N,. Thus some Value Of
Mg must lie in this range when M = Mi, a non-multiple of p. A similar argu-
ment holds for N2. N3, and N. (which were singled out for simplicity 0f WOO“
since they have few prime divisors and hence “small gaps").

15, Quadratic and cubic modules. The question
real module has already been answered in Part I (1
modules the answer becomes extremely involved as
We carry the investigation only as far as n = 3.

Starting with quadratic (complex) modules, we ﬁnd that stability re u‘
ﬁrst of all that the norm assume its minimum at three (=Q + 1) valuesqérne;
their negatives), lying on a circle with center at the origin. This shows the
lattice to be equivalent under rotation to the equilateral lattice. Thus the
my stable quadratic (complex) modules are given by the module p9, where p is a
ﬁxed integer and D is the set of all integers, in R(exp 21ri/3).

In the case af cubic modules with one real and two complex conjugate: (n = 3,
y: 1, s = 1), we ﬁnd, as indicated earlier without proof (12 p. 269), that all
iuch modules have stable norms. To see this we start with the observation that
the order D of EU? has one fundamental unit W = (101,101,103). Now it; is not
real nor is any power of 102 real, since the only real numbers in a complex cubic
ﬁeld are rational. This shows that the argument of 102 is incommensurable
with Zr, and therefore the directions of the complex vectors 1112’", (m=0,
5:1, 1:2, . , .) are everywhere dense mod 21r. Thus for every 29 of minimal
norm, the set 2 2 now" has the same norm while the projections Rum, Rz‘illl,
Ri,[z, each in two-dimensional space, are everywhere dense with respect to
direction, thus establishing the positive span and stability. (For an illustrative
Stability conﬁguration see (7).)
