Morse reported that Euwena had declined the RA
offer and that Garvin had been awarded an NSF fellowship;
Tubis, Sartori and Dretsky had accepted; Glendenning had '
refused and Winkel had not been heard from. The Physics 3
Department has no other recommendations now.

Lin reported that K. Balaton has accepted Reich is
going elsewhere and that McIlroy is now recommended as an addi-
tional RA. The Committee approved. Lin also brought up the
application or Dr. Bayard Rankin from the University of Cali-
fornia as a possible post-doctoral fellow. The Committee de- -
aided that if there is someone of the Mathematics faculty who -
is interested enough in Rankin's main line or activity to wish .
to supervise his work, an appointment would be appropriate. .

Caldwell recommended that Boy be continued in his ~
appointment next year. This was approved; D. A. Huffman to be .
his supervisor. Morse reported that Professor Hurley had
recommended the continuation or Vozorr, which was also approved.

Hrones said the mechanical Engineering Department may have a
recommendation next time. Adana indicated there may be recommen—
dations from the Sloan School for a man to work on some appli~
cations of machines to industrial practice.

Adams also indicated that there were possible PE
thesis problems for Math students who were interested. He and
Verzuh, Lin and Hildebrand will discuss this and report back
next time.

The next meeting will be at 3:00 p.m., Wednesday,
April 28.
