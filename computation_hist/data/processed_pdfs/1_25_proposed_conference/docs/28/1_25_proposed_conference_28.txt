This note is to acquaint you with the latest
developments regarding our computing center representctives
meeting. The American Mathematical Society, through its
Executive Director, Dr. Gordon Walker, has kindly offered
To sponsor the meeting and undertake the task of arranging
accommodation, publishing the report, and generally supply=-
ing the clerical and organisational help required to bring
off a meeting of the contemplated size. We have tentatively
accepted the idea of holding the meeting after the regular
American Mathematical Society meeting at the University of
Chicago on April 22-23, 1960. That is, our meeting would
take place on Thursdey to Saturday, April 24-26 and be con=-
fined to those invited to attend. This will give our
particinants the chance to attend the A.M.S. meeting if
they are interested. I am contacting Arthur Grad to find
out the N,S.F.%s reaction to this idea and am confident that
it will be favourable. We are not sure where exactly our
meeting should be held; whether at the University of Chicago,
at a neighbouring hotel, such as the Windermere, at one of
the other hotels, or perhaps somewhere else, not too far
from Chicagos such as Urbana, if facilities There seem
perticularly attractive. I should much appreciate your advice
on this matter. In any cacze, please let me know if â€˜you have
any violent objections to our plans since we must forge
ahead with all speed and hope to launch the N.,S.F. application
during the first week in December,
