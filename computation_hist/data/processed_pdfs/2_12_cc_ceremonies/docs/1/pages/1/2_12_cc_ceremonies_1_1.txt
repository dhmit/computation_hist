of the Center will be described, the
procedures for using the equipment are
outlined and our plans for research on

Because of delays in building construction, the machines may
not be fully operative by May 24. They will be in place, however, and
you will be able to see the general layout and to discuss your plans for
future use of the Center with our staff.

Parking space for a limited number of cars will be arranged
in the main parking lot behind the main dome —— the guard at the
Massachusetts Avenue entrance to the parking lot will direct you. The
Center is on the first floor of the new Karl T. Compton Laboratories ——

We would appreciate your filling out the appended form and
returning it to me, so we can make appropriate plans.

Sincerely yours,

 

Director
