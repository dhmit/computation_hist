should be adede (. Ro arguments).

q. In all systems references to tape and channel numbers
should be sympolic and indirect whenever possiblc. Thus there
will be a minimum of inconvenience whenever tape assignment.
conventions must be changed.

g, Bech rum sn either the FMS or SOS system should have
an initial (I.Dl) card with a format that will be specified by

the center.

The physical channels and tapes used by the FMS system
along with the logical tape numbers to be used in Fortran
programs are:

B sicail-u -F
hysical Logical Function

 

R 1 - System

NP = L - Inpul

A FEe= 2 _ Output for printing

Ah - 8 - Fortran Intermediate

Bl = 5 - Binary Input Tape and Primary
chain Tape€

Bo.-= -6 - Fortran Intermediate and Secondaly
chain Tape

B? =B - Fortran Intermediate and gecondary
Chain Tape€

B =cel) _ Output for punching

The programmer should not use in his program 1ogical
tapes 1, 2ol L for other than theilr designated purposes and
should not gggggg_thgm. Tape 9 6, 7 can pe used without
restrictions as programnm scratch tapes if the CHAIN or the CALL
PDUMP features arec not usead.

Tape 8 can always pe used as @ program scratch tape.
