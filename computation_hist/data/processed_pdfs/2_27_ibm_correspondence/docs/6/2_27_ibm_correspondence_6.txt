Dear Dr. Hauck:

It is with a great deal of pleasure that I enclose our check
for $1, 757.50 representing the first semester portion of the stipends
for the IBM Research Associate and Assistant recently appointed for
the 1959-60 school year in connection with the M.1.T. Computation
Center. A detailed description of the appointments is attached.

oad The increasing use of the IBM 704 Computer at MI. T.
by the New England colleges both as an educational device and a
research tool has been very encouraging to IBM, and we are delighted
that the University of Maine is having an active part in it as
represented by these research appointments.

Sincerely x 8,
M. Loren Bullock S
