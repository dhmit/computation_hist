Memorandum to Users of the MIT Computation Center 704.
Subject: Limitation on Computing Time

The requests for time on the 704 have been increasing steadily
for the past two years. Already the schedule is close enough to
saturation that processing delays occur at times of peak demand. It
is apparent that this spring the requested machine time will total
more than the time alloted to M.I.T. on the Center's 704. According
to the agreement with IBM two shifts are available for educational-
research computing, one shift for M.I.T., the other for the other
New England colleges. Until recently the other colleges have not used
all their shift, so that M.I.T. has had more than a single shift available.
But the time used by the other colleges has increased, so that this year
nearly all its time is filled and there is less for M.I.T.

The Center has endeavored to accommodate for the increased load
by running Pne Saturday a month (used primarily by the other colleges,
the rgleasea week—day time being used by M.I.T.) and by encroaching on
the third (IBM) shift when processing delays rose to longer than 24
hours. We hope to run two Saturdays a month this spring and to encroach
on the third shift from time to time but, even then, requested time

will exceed time available for M.I.T.

Computing time can be delay—limited or it can be limited in
advance by imposing quotas. The Center believes it is more appropriate
to impose quotas. Hereafter problems requiring machine time will be

classified as follows:

A For use in {cm;A”“‘&;“H but

B. Problems which directly or incidentally develop new
programs or techniques which will be useful to other
machine users.
