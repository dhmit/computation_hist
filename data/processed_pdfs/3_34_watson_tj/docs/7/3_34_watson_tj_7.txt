Memo to: Dr. Cari ¥. Floe
Proms Philip M. Morse

Subject: Invitation to Mr. Watson and other Corporation
Members to a Review of the Program of the

Computation Center, 3:00 - 5:00 p.u., Tuesday
Maro 3, S08 or? ! !

1. It is suggested that Mr. Watson plus other Corporation
members, if interested, be invited to a session in which the
progress made by the Computation Center, in its flrst year of
existence, is briefly reviewad and our plans for educational
and research work for next year are discussed. The agenda
would be roughly as follows:

A. Review of activity - Morse
B. Cooperative Program with H. E. Colleges - Corbate and

Blackbum
C. New Research - Arden and McCarthy
D. Future Plans - Morse

The meeting would be informal (like a Visiting Committee meet-
ing) so we should hold the attendance numbers down.

2. The invitation to Mr, Watson should suggest that 4 or 5
people from IBM would be welcome. In particular we suggest
Piore, McDowell, Hurd and DeCarlo, if they ean come (particu
larly Plore). He may wish to add an additional name or two.
Only 5 or §& of the Center Staff need be present, 2 or 3 from
the president-chancellor's office might wish to come (yourself
if you can make it), and 2 or 3 other Corporation members, would
make a total of 18 « 20. We could have it in the Center Confer
ence Room, but this is set up like a class room. Is there a
more comfortable room avallable? We need not be close Lo the
machine; the 7C4 can be visited at the end of the meeting by
those wishing to do =o.

%. Please let me know how this develops and what I can de next.
