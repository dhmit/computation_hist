.4 running effectively on a one-shift, 40 hour-a-week basis.
.anteract this, the non-ONR project support might be increased
$100,000 a year. In addition, the Institute 1s endeavoring to
sbtain general support from industry, to supplement the present
ONR support and, we hops, e¢ventually to superscde it. Perhaps by
1956 this support could amount to about 50,000, though this is
only @ hope as yet. s el
The most optimistie estimate would be to expect that,
though Lincoln will not (zive the Support At gives now, it still
will contribute enough &5 that only 200,000 a year extra would /
be needed. If non-ONR projeects could contribute F80,000-F100,000
and general industrial contributions of #50,000 a year could be
raised, then only $50,000 to $70,000 would be needed to carry through
1956-12%’{. Further extrapolation beyond this date is obviously
impossible.

Recommendation - It is therefore recommended that OHR
grant an additional 420,000 to £30,000 to be used in 1955-1956
for WWl operat badget (4.e., supplementary funds for project
DIC 6345), that ,000 to $70,000 be tentatively allosated to
6345 for 1956-1957, that no further funds be allocated for project
6915, and that in December 1955 the gitustion be re-evaluated %o
see what later needs will be,

If thi: can be done, it will be possible to furnieh ocom~
puting time free to CNR projects at the Inatitute, as well as %o
general eduecaticaal resecarch here, for anothsr year, and there
will be no need to take on iobs outside the Institute to keep
