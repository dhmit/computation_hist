We shall assume for convenience that H(r) is regular and real for r reg] 4 d
that = and y are real in all cases under consideration. ¢
To prove the existence of R by iteration, we rewrite the system (2) as th

where B(z, ) is the rectangle formed by the horizontal and vertical lines throyg}

This series is seen to be convergent and to represent a solution to (3). Equation

(3), or system (2), also has a unique solution, or otherwise expressed, any solution

to the homogeneous form of (3), with the term 1 deleted, would vanish identi-

cally. |
These statements are made because the iteration process will motivate the

rest of the paper.
