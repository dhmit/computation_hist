Dear Professor Morse:

As I mentioned in our staff meeting of December 4, I am
writing to request a report on machine usage during the university
time,

I am especially interested in a breakdown of usage into
MIT time and other New England colleges time. I would appreciate
it if I could get a summary of this information before the end of the
year. As we agreed in the meeting, it would seem feasible to make
this information available on a monthly basis thereafter. I would
appreciate being included on the monthly distribution of this informa -
tion as soon as the procedure is setup. I need this information to
answer various questions that are put to me from time to time by
persons within IBM who need to know how effective the program is
at any given time.

Sin ly yours,
