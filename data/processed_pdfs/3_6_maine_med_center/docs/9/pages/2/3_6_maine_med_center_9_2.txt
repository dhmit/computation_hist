Calculations of this sort assume that the

mem-
brane concept is

& correct one for which there
is ample evidence. P is assumed to be located
within a homogenous conductor which sur-
rounds the polarized membrane

and is of in-
finite extent.

The relation of the potential
recorded at the distant point P to the value
existing at the actual surface of the membrane
1s what is briefly symbolized as Q and is con-
cerned with (h).

Helmholtz also described a special case of
finding the potentials of a known electromotive
force in a spherical conductor. The theorems
proposed by him allow the formulation

from which (3a) has been derived. It applies
to a dipole situated centrally within a sphere
and surrounded by an infinite medium. The
potential recorded from a point located within
a limited spherical surface (172) may be given
as

where 7 is the distance of the dipole from P,
R the diameter of the sphere. This describes
a situation applicable to finite boundaries,
and was developed with reference to Ein-
thovens equations by Craib and Canfield.!
The influence of various shaped boundaries on
the distribution of currents within the enclosed
system of the chest is obviously of considerable
interest to those concerned with measuring
cardiac action currents from the surface of
the body. In a paper by C. V. Nelson in this
1ssue,' the striking alterations in current flow

description of his doctrine as given by his
biographer is appended. The image concept
was known to Wilson and is mentioned in a
paper from his laboratory but it seems to have
escaped general attention. Nelson’s paper is
of fundamental interest since it

shows a
method for

solving boundary problems in
ele('t.roval'diography, at least for straight line
boundaries and for boundaries of a circular
plane. Tt should be added that Thomson car-
ried the problem further for the solution of
the effects of boundaries of a sphere, but it
was W. M. Hicks" who apparently first pub-
lished a complete analysis of spherical bound-
aries in 188(.1 According to Hicks, the image
of an electrical source X located within a
sphere of radius R at a distance g from its

center 1s a source X! at the distance —, and
a

a line of sinks reading from the Image source
X' to infinity.

A single observation may be cited which
points to the practical significance of considera-
tions of this kind: A zero point of reference,
the ideal position for an ideal indifferent elec-
trode, has always been considered to be lo-
cated halfway between the source and sink
of a dipole. It is not so located if the boundary
1s taken into account.

This brief discussion should bring to mind
again the fact that the basic laws of electricity
developed during the 19th century are ap-
plicable to a theory of electrocardiography
today. As in other disciplines, research in this
field has its roots in the past from which
