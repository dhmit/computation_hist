Dr. Clifford V. Nelson

Director, Basic Cardiovascular Research
Maine Medical Center

Portland, Maine

Dear Dr. Nelson:

Thanks for sending me material on your problem. As
I indicated when you telephoned, we could help you only if
you can make arrangements to have the work carried out as
part of the research of a New England college. I suggest you
get in touch either with Professor R. Le. of Bowdoin
College or with Mr. Horace Pratt of the University of Maine,
to ses whether there is a faculty member of one or the other
of these institutions who would be willing to help you lay
out the work for machine calculation and could help get the
runs made here. We have no coding staff, so the faculty
member would have to help you with the coding and would need
to come down here at least to see the problem through its
"debugging‚Äù stage.

We also cannot promise you unlimited time on the TOU;
28 other colleges are using the facilities and if your problem
requires considerably more than a few hours of machine time,
you may not be able to get it all done here.

T hope you can get someone in Bowdoin or the University
of Maine interested enough to help you, and that we will hear
from one school or the other, concerning your problem, sometime
this spring.

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse
Director
