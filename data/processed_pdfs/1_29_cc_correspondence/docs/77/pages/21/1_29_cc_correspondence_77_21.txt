to binary, and assign them to successive storage locations
starting with the current value of the location counter.

But, first, if there is a symbol in the location field,

enter this symbol in the dictionary as a relocatable symbol
having as its value the current value of the location counter,
so that the first octal integer in the variable field may

be referred to by this symbol." For example, suppose the

location counter reads 390010 and the assembler encounters

the instruction:

LOCATION OP VARIABLE FIELD

DATA OCT T =17 66, 55, -44

The effect of this instruction is to enter the symbol DATA
into the dictionary as a relocatable symbol whose value is
3900, and to convert the five integers to binary and assign
them to locations 3900-3904, leaving the location counter

at 3905. The five numbers convert to the 36-bit numbers:

Al Wit T
400 000 000 077
000 000 000 066
000 00C 000 055
400 000 000 044

Any number of subfields, separated by commas, may be used;
the last subfield must be terminated by a blank. Consecutive
commas cause the number zero to be generated, as does a

comma followed by a blank. Hence the number of words of

data generated is always one more than the number of commas

in the variable field.

The DEC pseudo-operation says to the assembler: ''Take the
decimal numbers which are specified, one per subfield from
left to right in the variable field, convert these numbers

to binary, and assign them to successive locations starting
