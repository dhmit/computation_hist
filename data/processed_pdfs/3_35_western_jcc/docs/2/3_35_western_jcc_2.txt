Mr, Louis Fein

Session Chairman, WJCC
431 Ferne Avenue
Palo Alto, California

Dear Mr, Pein:

Thank you for sending your queries, Several of the
staff here have tried giving talks of the general sori you
mention, The results of such talks have been such that they
are not enthusiastic about giving others like them, Consequently,
I cannot arouse any interest in the staff here contributing to
your seminar,

Sincerely yours,

Philip M. Morse
Director
