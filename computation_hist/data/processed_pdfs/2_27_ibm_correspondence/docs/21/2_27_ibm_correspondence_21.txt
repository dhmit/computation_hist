1 an enclosing a short note on the modiﬁcation of the [BI 704
which we would like to put into effect. The memo indicates sole or the
my interesting applications which can he worked on it the modification
can be done. Ie had thought originally 01 laking the nachise Iodiiication
ourselves but we are a little hesitant about getting into the machine and
possibly holding up operation for a while. Is now understand that the
seditiontion we desire has been node a standard one which is nvailnble to
the 704 custo-ers upon appropriate payment.

I should think that the standard 13! nodifichtion would be the
desirable way or making this change but the standard 18! price is out of
our reach. I hesitate to ask Mario's division to 0.1. the donation
since it is more for research than it is for purely educational uses (it
you can ever separate these two). At any rate, it you feel this would be
a desirable thing, for us to have your support or our request, through
Shader to “Carlo, it would be welcomed. The reason we feel urgent about
it is that a couple of. the researchers who would like to use this device
are PhJ. theses and. it we have no hope of making the modiﬁcation soon,
the graduate students will make their part of the equipment fit some
other machine which will reduce our flexibility later.

You have probably heard that our Joint conierence will be held
on lriday, December 20. Io hope you can come here that day. It you do.
we can talk to you further about this matter.

Yours ,
