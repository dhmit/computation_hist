2. A feature for grouping subprograms into packages
such that the package has the same external simplicity as a
single Subprogram. This process can lead to arbitrarily deep
nests of groups.

In particular a LLS program is a relocatable binary program
with three tables,in front of the program, that contain the symbolic
information necessary for linkage, array storage allocation, and
parameter determination at loading time. These tables are called

the USE table, the DEFINITION table, and the ARRAY table.

1. The USE table

 

The USE table contains a list of entries, each of which
consists of a symbolic expression together with a list of the
fields in the program where the value of the expression is to be
substituted. For example, a matrix inversion program may contain
an entry stating that the value of the symbolic expression A+N*N
is to be inserted in the address fields of locations 97l, 975, and
1024 of the routine relative to its beginning in memory. The
amount of arithmetic allowable in the symbolic expression is subject
to various degrees of ambition, but the address arithmetic of SAP
is adequate for a start with possibly the Boolean arithmetic of
SCAT as an immediate successor. More extreme is a LISP-like recursive
expression.

a; The DEFINITION table

 

The DEFINITION table is a list of pairs. The first entry in
each pair is a symbol and the second entry is a symbolic expression

which defines the value of the symbol. The location of the beginning
