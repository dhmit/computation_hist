Dear Professor Morse:

Thank you for your letter of May 1). Like the Center,
our annual report has been delayed, and the picture section is
still not quite complete. We should therefore be glad if you
would keep us in mind when the photographs are taken. F~ven
though they do arrive too late, they can always be held in

reserve for next year's report.

Sincerely yours,

oe A. LAL,
