Reference: Contract N50ri-06001 ' DIC-#6345, #6915

| Under the proposed plan submitted herewith, Project
#6345 (Whirlwind Operation) would terminate on June 30, 1957.
The task order for this period would include the usual Vhirlwind
project activities:

1. Research in methods of numerical analysis and
the formulation of scientific problems for machine
solution, together with the training of personnel
in thegse methods.

2. Support of the Sclentiflc and Engineering Applica-
tlions Group of Project Whirlwind so as to make the
computer useful and available for the above-mentioned
regearch. .

In addition, 1t ie proposed that the following task
order arising in connection with the Type 704 EDPM be included:

3. The development of a sultable interpretive program
and assoclated coding techniqueese to permit effective
implementation of the Type 704 machine.

It is anticlgated that a separate project will be set
up to handle the Type 704 utilization within the MIT Computation
Center, and a geparate request to the ONR for support of this work
will be made in the neear future. In thils respect certein
experienced programmers could be made avallable for transfer to

this new task as of January 1, 1957. This anticipated transfer

has been taken into account in the budget proposed for Project #6345,

The foregoing proposal does not take into consideration
termination costs which may be associzted with the oclose out of
this contract and the possible dlsposition of the Vhirlwind Computer.
It is proposed to delay the submittal of any budget for this matter
until such time as disposition of the Whirlwind Computer is
determined.

The estimated budget for the period July 1, 1956 to
June 30, 1957 1ls attached herewlith as page 3.

Very truly yours,
