Dear Professor Morse,

On behalf of the Tufts Chapter of
Sigma Xi I wish to than; you for your fine presentation
of "The Use of High Speed Digital Computers‚Äù at the Tufts
Chapter meeting on this past Tuesday evening. I am sure
that we all have a better idea of what these digital
computers are and can do. I know nothing about math and
found your presentation both interesting and informative.

Thank you again.

Sincerely vours
