Dear Professor Caldwell:

I have reviewed your letter of Juue 22, %o De. Draper, relative
to the transfer of the Differential Analyzer Facilities %o thic labora-
tory and particnlarly %o the transfer of the associsied shop facilities
effective July 1, 1950. St

o We find no point of difference with your leSter and accept i%
in its entirety.

I believe you have talked with Panl Cusick relative to the
transfer of the inventory to the Inetrumenietion Leboratory. We have in-
formed Paul that this transfer is acceptable to ws end have requested his
advice to the end that the transfer ean de offected in & menner accoptable
to the Covernment auditors. Howard Forbas, Purchasing Agzent of this
laboratory, should ve kept informsd of all setica in this area.

Non-gtaff personnel in ocur leboratory are under the supervision
of Robert S. Temblyn. I am referring your lotter o Bo® gso that he can
talte the action necessary to get Froat, Forbes and Wipther on our payzroll
effective July 1, 1950.

The DIC mumber assigned %o the Differentinl Analyzer is 6783.
The szlaries of the three ghop men and all further rateriala required by
the shop should be charged ageinst this number. The same number will, of.
courss, bte charged with the inventory tranmsfer already mentioned. Thig
munber will also carry fhe salary of Fredrickson end the pecond Ingtrumenta~
tion Laborstory man whom we send over for training purposes.
