suggested budget, for three years, is tentative and is more
depenﬂent on our ability to hire one or two’moro experts in
computer programming than on the amount of work to be done. If

we can find more men of the right sort, more work can be done.
During the calendar year 1957 we may rot be able to find more

than one senior man, one or two post-doctoral fellows and a couple
o technical assistants. By the fall of 1957 we may be able to
persuade one or two faculty members of the cooperating institutions
to spend appreciable fractions of their time at the Center, works
ing on some of the problems mentioned earlier. A suitable fraction
of thelr salaries should be carried by the research funds of the
Center and, if the work is in the social sciences, would be charge=-
able tb the proposed grant. Some of the experiments in "gaming"
will require special input og;ﬁg&put equipment. Therefore, it may
turn out that less than 35,000 wlll be spent the first year; more
than 35,000 the second. The important point, however, is that be-
