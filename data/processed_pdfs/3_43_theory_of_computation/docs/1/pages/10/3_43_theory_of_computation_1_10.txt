Let I be the set of non-negative integers
0,1,2,..;} and .denote the successor of an
integer by n' and denote the equality of

integers n and n2 by nlznz. If we define

functions succ and eq by

 

succ(n) = n'

eq(nl,nz) =pe 1 nl =n,

=1t ny 7 n,

then we write Cz; &= succ,eq} . We are interested
in- C g’f? . Clearly all functions in C({’?y
will havé either integers or truth values as
values,

First we dofine the predecessor function
pred (not defined for n=0) by

pred(n) = pred2(n,0)

pred2(n,m) = (wm'=n — m.T— pred2(n,mn')).
We shall denote pred(n) by n~

Now we define the sum

.

min = (n=0 —m,T — m"+n"),
tho product 3

mxn = (n=0 — 0,T -~ m+mxn")
the differcnce

m-n = (n=0-=>n,T = m—-n")

which is defined only for m?Z n, the inequality
m<n = (n=0) v (v(n=0)A (m" < n )
the strict inequality
m<n = (n<n) 4~ (m=n)
the integer valued quotient
m/n = (m<n--0,T— ((m-n)/n)"'),
the remainder
rem(m/n) = (n < n-—m,T— rem(m-n/n))
and the divisibility of a number n by a number
m
m'n = (n:O)\/(Oan0/1(m[(n—m))).
The primeness of a number is defined by
prime(n) = (n£0) /] (n£l) Aprine 2(n,?2
