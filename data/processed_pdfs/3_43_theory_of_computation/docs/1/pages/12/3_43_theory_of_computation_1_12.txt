Functions with functions as arguments are called
functionals.

Another example is the functional least(p)
which gives the least integer n such that p(n) for
a predicate p. e have 5

least(p) = least2(p,0)
where

least2(p,n) = (p(n) =+ n,T— least2(p,n+l))

In order to use functionals it is necessary
to have a notation for naming functions. We use
Church's! lanbda notation. Suppose we have a
function £ defined by an equation f(x ,...,x =0
where e 1is soie expression in xl,..., 8

The name of this function is 2((}{1, .o oxn).e) o LOPr

f defined by

example, the name of the function
- 2 : : 2
£(x,y) = x“+y is A ((x,y),%x%+y).
A(x,y),x2+y) (3,4) = 13 but
AUy, %) ,%%4+y) (3,4) = 19.
The variables occurring in a2 definition are
dumny or bound variables and can be replaced by
others without changing the function provided
the replacement is done conblstcntly. For ex-
ample, the C“ple5101o 7y (Cas, y),“ +y) and
2((u,v), “+v) and A ((y,x),y2+x) all represent
the same function. Tisir=2

‘hen the functions with which we are dealing
are defined rccursively, a difficulty arises,

level 2 we have functionals taking functions of = =~ —
level 1 as arguments, At level 3 are functionals'

taking functionals of level 2 as argunents etec,
Actually functionals of several variables can be
of mixed type.

However, this hierarchy does not exhaust
the possibilities, and if we allow functions
which can take themselves as arguments we can ;
eliminate the use of label in naming recursive |
functions., Suppose that we have a function f !
defined by =

f(x) = £(x,£)
where £(x,f) is some expression in
function variable £,
named o

This function can be

label(f, 7 ((x), 2 (%)) . i

ilowever, supposc we define a function g by

g(X) (p) = 6 (X, /7(()() ;?(X:g)))

(%, A((x) :8’(’* ?))))
we Lhen have v

f(x) = g(x,g)
since g(x,g) satisfies the equation |
g(x,8) = £(x, 3((x),e(x,8))) '
Now we can write f as 3
Pe=b F6x) 5 ClY; {?) Ly, 2((u), &(u, 5‘/*))))
(x, A ((y, 8”é§(y Aet(u)i =5

eﬂth “))))

This eliminates label at what scems to be an
excessive cost. Namely, the expression gets
quitc complicated and we must admit functionals
capable of taking themselves as arguments thus
escaping our orderly hierarchy of functionals,
