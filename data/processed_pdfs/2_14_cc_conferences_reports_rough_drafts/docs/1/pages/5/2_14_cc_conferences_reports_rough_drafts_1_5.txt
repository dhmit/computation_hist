5. Machine solution of simultaneous linear algebraic equations,

6. Solution of partial differential equetions on computing equipment,
7. A study of machines and components: REAC, CPC, and WVI,

8. Application of computers to practical probleas,

9. Evaluation of available @puting equipment.

Needless to say, this outline proved to be a rather smbitious undertaking.
Particularly, when one considers that 3-hour subject ( offered on a semester
besis) contains only 43 lecture hours.

It was immedietely apparent that this outline hed to be curtailed
in some manner. One solution was to delimit the list of available computers
to the following types:

1. The desk calculators: Friden, Marchant and Monroe,
2. The REAC Analog Computer,

3. The IBM Cerd Programmed Calculator (CPC)

4. The Whiriwind Computer -- Summer Session version,
5. Other Computers in general.

Admittedly, this shortened the task appreciably; however, it was still a
large assignment.

Figure 2 illustrates a block diegram of the subject material which
immedistely raises another question: What is the proper sequence to present
the material in the classroon? Should a "horizontal line" attack be used, i.e.,
to study all five clesses of problems on & particuler mechine? Perheps &
"wvertical” approach should be used? Maybe 2 "sig-zag" approach should be used?
Fortunately or unfortunstely as the case may be, time did not perait a thorough
study of the program shown in Figure 2. Therefore, e "gvertical line" of
presentation was employed as described in succeoding sections.
