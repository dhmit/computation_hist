Proposed Budget

Some costs of the Symposium can be borne by having them charged
to Government contracts of the individuals concerned. We have estimated that
there will be 85 grants for travel expense and per diem. The average travel grant

is estimated to be $150 and the average per diem $72 or 6 days at $12 per day. Thus
