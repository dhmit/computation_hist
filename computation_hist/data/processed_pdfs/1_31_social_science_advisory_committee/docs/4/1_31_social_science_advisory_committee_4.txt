Now that the installation of an I.B.M. 704 at the Computa-
tion Center at M.I.T. is only a month or so off, we should get
started planning our research program for the next academic
year. We hope that an important part of our work will involve
research in the soclal sciences. To provide for this possi-
bility, to advise us on the directions to explore and to serve
as llaison between the Computation Center and research groups in
goclal sclence in thls neighborhood, we desire to set up an
advisory committee on machine applications to the social sciences.

Could you meet with me and several others of the Center staff
to help organlze this committee? I append a sheet with several
possible dates. Could you mark those dates which you could make,
with numbers 1, 2,... in order of preference, and mark with
crosses those you can't make, sign the sheet and mail it back?

~ Thanks.
