to departmental budgets. Also possibly special felliowships and
other grants could be obtained t¢ help with F.

Sgace Problems - To house this equipment, staff and space for
classes, we would need 8,000 square feet working area, st least
twice as much space as our present IBM installation (itewm B) is
using. There are several possible ways of getting this space (no
order of preference is implied in the following list}!

1. Take more space in Bullding 20. (Probably not possible.)

2. Build a new bullding to house it. (Not very expensive
construction, but would need air conditioning.) 7y

3. ©See if IBM could provide space for it in a possible new.
building they are considering building in Cembridge for
their own sales crganization (not feasible unless the IBM
bullding were on or very close to the campus). The Barta
Bullding, now housing Whirlwind, would not be desirable
and, In addition, Whirlwind will be used by Lincoln Labs.
for several years after we relinquish it.

Participation by other Universities - If MIT can give our sister
colleges in flew England some benefits of the Computing Center, it
would be a little easier to explain why we got such preferential
treatment. Even without the desire of IBM for us to do so, it
probably would be good policy to extend an offer of help, even to
the extent of having a coordinatiocn committee of representatives
from some of the other Institutions. The cooperation would not
amount to much unless the other institution contributed actively,
which would mean in practice having at least one of their starff
at the center at least half the time. In fact, it might be
appropriate to sgay that any institution which wishes to partici- .
pate actlvely should contribute directly to the support of budgets
E and F, either by cash payments or contribution of personnel.

Possible Timing - IBM Indicates that it will not have a TO4 avail-
able ror us until about January 1957. Until that time the present
arrangements glven in items A and B can continue, these groups
getting thelir funds by charging the DIC projects. Since MIT is
already giving courses on machine uze, IBM has offersd to give

us a 60 per cent educational discount on the machines 1in item B,
until the time when the 704 will be sent to us. This will ease
the budget pressure on B. Item C will have to be discontinued on
June 1956, unless8 machine earnings have increased sufficlently for
Ssome money to be avallable to hire graduate assistants..

In this transition pericd the two groups A and B are being
coordinated, so they can be combined into one group, when the new
equipment comes, with minimum loss of efficiency.

The main question requiring decision in the near future is
that of housing. The present plans and the donation of the equip-
ment by IBM cannet be implemented unless the 8,000 square feet of
working space is avallable for the proposed Couwputing Center by or
before January 1957.
