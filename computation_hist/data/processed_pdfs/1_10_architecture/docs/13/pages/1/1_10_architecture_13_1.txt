Room 6-109

Dear Professor Morse:

I am enclosing a copy of a trip report containing the results
of the meetings at the IBM Corporation in NYC on July 24th,

Since we did not have adequate information regarding the noise
measurements on the 704, Mr, Labate made additional measurements on
Saturday, July 28th, He intends to have a final report regarding his
findings in your hands in the very near future,

Section 5 of this trip report indicates present plans regarding
the trip to Poughkeepsie during August 24-29, respectively,

The day~long meeting at MIT on Friday, July 27th, was highly
successful, and we are currently working on a final outline for the
course which we will discuss with you on your return,

Sincerely yours

ek

F, M, Verzuh
