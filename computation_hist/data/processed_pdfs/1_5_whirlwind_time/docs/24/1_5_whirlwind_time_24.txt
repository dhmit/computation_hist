~ referred to my attention. In accordance with your request for
~ literature on programming the IBM 704, I am enclosing a manual
on this machine, This 4s a typical IBM manual which provides
basic information regarding the machine and its uge. However,
I am certain you realige that it does not describe any of the
‘interpretive systems that have been developed for the 704.
Particularly, I am referring to IBM's FORTRAN, G.E.'s CAGE,
and United Airsraft's SAP, etc, The latter material will be
available during the forthcoming academic year, When you
arrive in September, you should contact me TSANG this
additional material,

1 have checked whether your income from the assistant-
ship is taxable from the U,8, Government, and I find that it

‘is indeed taxable!

Sincerely yours,
