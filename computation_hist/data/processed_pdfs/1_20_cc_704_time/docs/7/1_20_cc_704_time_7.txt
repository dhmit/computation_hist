Dear Dr. Verzuh:

In answer to your questionnaire dated February 7, 1957,
regarding the use of the 704 computer, I should like to state the
minimum request of the Solid-State and Molecular Theory Group
for the fiscal year 1957-58. We should like to request a minimum
of 50 hours of machine time, which we understand will be charged
at the rate of $180 per hour. This time will be both for the use
of the members of the group who are on my ONR contract, and also
for those who are on the Lincoln staff, or otherwise supported
by Lincoln. Of the $9, 000 which will be charged for the time, we
shall expect to pay one half from my ONR contract, and Dr. Lax
and Dr. Davenport have informed me that Lincoln will be prepared
to pay the other half. I hope that it will be possible to make this
much time available for our project work. I understand from the
discussions on February 7 that additional time will be available
for thesis work and other purely academic work.

Sincerely yours,

John C. Slater
Institute Professor
