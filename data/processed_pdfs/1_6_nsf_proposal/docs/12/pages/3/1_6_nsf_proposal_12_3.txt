research group, which will energize and take the lead in the re-
search carried on at the Computation Center by students and staff
of MIT and the participating colleges., We list 1n<Aaﬁta¢tg¢£mJ(&
of the specific research projects we are prepared to start on.
Other projects will develop naturally from these and from the
problems encountered by the other workers at the Computation
cqnterf '

@he project would not start at full strength. The 704 will
not be installed untll January or February 1957, though analytic
work can be started before the machine is installed. The present
Whirlwind computing research group can be supported by the present
ONR contfaét until December 1956, but a few new staff members must
be broﬁght in in September in order to get ready for the new machine
installation., We estimate that a total budget of $60,000 would
suffice for the next academic year, $90,000 for 1957-58 and $100,000
for 1958-590.;\[1\% thef;&m:l‘g&gf} \‘1 g;xthe program should be re-
evaluated to determine needs beyond that time.

After conversations with the scientific directors and division
chiefs of ONR and NSF, we are requesting financial support from
both agencles, an equal share from each. We believe the work can
be divided so that separate contracts can be written. Some of the
proposed tasks would be different, though some of the broader
fields of investigation would 6verlap. We would hope that we could
put out a combined progress report. In some published papers,
credit could be given to one organization alone; in others, credit

would go to both. Bookkeeping would be somewhat more complicated,
