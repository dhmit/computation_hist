Fe;O4 is an inverse spinel, Fe*t(Fe**Fe*)0,. The
interaction between the tetrahedral Fe®t ions and the
octahedral ions can be fully explained by semicovalent
exchange but only partially by superexchange. Accord-
ing to both models the tetrahedral Fe®" ions would
couple antiferromagnetically with the octahedral Fe**
ions. However, superexchange does not provide for the
Fe**—Fe2t interaction since it applies only to inter-
actions between identical ions. Semicovalent exchange
corresponds to antiferromagnetic coupling in this case
also. Between the low-temperature transition and the
Curie point the spins on the octahedral sites are also
aligned parallel to each other through double exchange.
Therefore all the spins of the octahedral-site cations
are aligned parallel to one another and antiparallel to
those of the tetrahedral-site cations. In this temperature
interval both the superexchange and semicovalent-
exchange mechanisms provide for the ferromagnetism of
Fe;04. Below 119°K, however, the IFe3* and Fe** cations
are ordered so that double exchange cannot occur. At
these low temperatures the superexchange model
provides no mechanism for a parallel alignment of all
the octahedral-site spins. Since Fe;O,4 is ferromagnetic
below 119°K, the antiparallel alignment of all octa-
hedral-site spins with respect to the tetrahedral-site
spins, and the consequent parallel alignment of the octa-
hedral-site spins must be due to semicovalent exchange.
Semicovalent exchange provides the more adequate
model.

It is proposed in this paper that the structure of
Mn;O4 is Mn*H(Mno!'1)O4. Elsewhere the structure
Mn?**(Mn**Mn*t)O; has been proposed. Mn*t in
tetrahedral sites is partially covalent. Mn'!! forms
square covalent bonds. Octahedral Mn?** and Mn**
would be ionically bound. In the Mn**(Mn?**Mn*+)O,4
model Mn** octahedral-tetrahedral interactions would
be antiferromagnetic according to both superexchange
and semicovalent exchange. The (Mn®* tetrahedral)-
(Mn** octahedral) interaction cannot be treated with
superexchange, but semicovalent exchange predicts
antiferromagnetic exchange. Thus the structure
Mn?**(Mn**Mn*")O4 would be ferromagnetic just like
Fet(Fe**Fe*t)04. Yet down to 72°K Mn3;0O4 has been
found to be paramagnetic.

In the structure Mn?**(Mn™'1)O4 there would be no
octahedral-tetrahedral semicovalent exchange because
all octahedral-site cations are covalently bound. There
would be no double exchange because Mn?* and Mn'!!
are ordered in different types of sites. Thus the model
Mn**(Mn'1)O4 is paramagnetic. Since Mn3O4 has been
found to be paramagnetic as low as 72K°, this observa-
tion supports the Mn?*(Mny''1)O,4 model in preference
to the Mn*t(Mn**Mn*")O4 model.

4. CUFCQO4

This spinel is partially inverse with the formula
Fe,Cui_a (CunFes_»)04 as discussed in Sec. IV B, 2.
If Cu'! forms square covalent bonds in the octahedral
sites, as is suggested in this paper to explain the
tetragonal structure of CuFe,Oy, then the octahedral
copper does not contribute to the magnetism.

Since the exchange between the octahedral- and tetra-
hedral-site cations is the only spin interaction of
significance in CuFe.0y, it is expected that the octa-
hedral-site spins, if they contribute at all to the mag-
netic moment, are parallel to one another and anti-
parallel to the tetrahedral-site spins. If M aus and Mus
are the atomic moments of tetrahedral-site and octa-
hedral-site copper respectively, where ps is a Bohr
magneton, then the magnetic moment per molecule of
CuFe;04 is | (2—2N)5+2AM,— (2N)5— (1—=2\)M o | ps
= | (1=2M)10—M .+ 2\ (M v+ M.) |ug. Pauthenet and
Bochirol® report 2.19us for the magnetic moment of a
CuFe;0,4 sample which had been quenched from a 700°C
anneal. Bertaut?” found that a similarly treated CuFe,O4
sample had an ordering parameter A=0.37. Although a
direct comparison between data from two different,
though similarly treated, samples is not strictly justified,
it is interesting that for A=0.37 the predicted magnetic
moment of CuFe,04is (2.64+0.74M,—0.26 M ;) us which,
for M,=1 and M,=0, is 2.3us(>2.19us). It is reason-
able to assume, therefore, that the octahedral-site
copper ions do not contribute to the magnetic moment.

VI. SUMMARY

The covalent bond in spinels has been shown to
influence cation ordering, lattice distortions, and
magnetic-exchange interactions. Covalent bonding
modifies the Madelung-energy and geometrical cal-
culations of previous workers. Octahedral and square
covalent-bond formation are as significant as is tetra-
hedral-bond formation in determining cation ordering
in spinels. From only qualitative considerations it was
possible to predict nearly all the observed cation
distributions.

While orthorhombic distortion, as observed in Fe;Oy,
can be ascribed to cation ordering in octahedral sites,
tetragonal distortion is shown to be due to ordering of
the square bonds in octahedral sites. The two distortion
mechanisms are vastly different, as is evident from the
difference in transition temperature, thermal hysteresis,
etc. A certain minimum concentration of square-bond-
forming cations in octahedral sites must be exceeded
for the lattice to distort. Covalent bonds in tetrahedral
sites tend to hinder tetragonal distortion.

The structure of Mn3;0O,; was found to be Mn?**
X (Mno'"1)O4 rather than Mn?*t(Mn*tMnit)O4. The
tetragonal structures of metallic indium and the
indates are accounted for by the square-bond model.

Semicovalence is defined as covalent bonding due to th

coupling of a single electron spin to the net spin on e
cation. This coupling leads to semicovalent exchange :
mechanism producing antiferromagnetic coupling ,of
cation spins. The paramagnetism of Mn?*(Mn,!11)0), is
explained on the basis of semicovalent exchange a.s4 is

APPENDIX I. THE INFLUENCE OF OXYGEN
(sp*)-ORBITAL HYBRIDIZATION ON THE
AXIAL RATIO OF TETRAGONAL SPINELS

In Sec. I.IIB, it.has beep pointed out that the oxygen
p* orbitals in a spinel are instrumental in the formation
9f covalent bon.ds between oxygen and its near neighbors
in ogtahedral sites. \v"Vhere there are empty cation orbit-
als in tetrahedral sites the oxygen can be bound co-
valently to at least two octahedral and one tetrahedral
cation through the admixture of oxygen (sp?) orbitals
with the p* orbitals. The p* orbitals overlap strongly
with the empty orbitals in the octahedral sites but not
with those in tetrahedral sites while the set of (sp?)
orbitals that overlap strongly with a tetrahedral site
do not overlap as strongly with the octahedral sites as
do the p* orbitals. Therefore the admixture of oxygen
(sp®) wave functions with the p* wave functions in-
creases the amount of covalent bonding of oxygen with a
tetrahedral near neighbor but decreases the amount
of covalent bonding with the octahedral near neighbors.

It has been proposed that the tetragonal distortion of
many spinels is due to square covalent bonds in octa-
hedral sites. When covalent bonds are formed by one
oxygen with both octahedral and tetrahedral sites
through (sp?) admixture, the bonds are less covalent in
the octahedral sites than they would have been if no
covalent bonds with the tetrahedral ions existed.
Therefore the axial ratio of a tetragonal spinel is a
maximum when only the octahedral cations are co-
valently bound, and decreases with increasing amount
of covalence in tetrahedral sites.

This can be quantitatively shown as follows. The
amount of covalence in the octahedral sites due to
oxygen p-orbital overlap and that in tetrahedral sites
due to oxygen (sp*)-orbital overlap is arbitrarily set at
unity. The amount of covalence in the octahedral sites
due to oxygen (sp*)-orbital overlap is given by 6(<1),
that in the tetrahedral sites due to p® overlap by the
very small fraction e. The wave function for the (sp?)
orbitals and the p* orbitals are admixed in the ratio a':B,
where o?+4 2= 1. The normalized mixed wave function
is then denoted by a(sp?)+B8(p*). The amounts of co-

:valence due to each term in the wave function is shown
in Table IV. [The physical properties are proportional
to the square of the wave functions; cross products
aB(sp?) (p°) are neglected here.] Therefore the amount
of covalence in octahedral sites is (a?6+/?). The amount
of electrovalence is 1— (a2+482). If it is assumed that
the bond length is a linear function of the amounts of
covalence and electrovalence, the following bond length
is then derived :

o' = (’0+5%)a+ (1—a®—p%, (A.1)

where a is the covalent bond length in octahedral sites
in the absence of (sp®) admixture, and ¢ is the electro-
valent bond length in octahedral sites. The axial ratio
is then given by

In spinels in which there is no appreciable covalent
bonding in tetrahedral sites, such as Mn;0y, the axial
ratio has been observed to be ¢/a=1.16. The amount of
overlap of oxygen (sp?) orbitals with octahedral cation
orbitals is estimated to be about 70 percent of that of
oxygen p* orbitals with octahedral cation orbitals. On
the assumption that §=0.8, the axial ratio is plotted in
Fig. 6 as a function of the admixture of oxygen (sp°)
orbitals.

For spinels like CdIn:O4 and ZnMn,O4 an axial ratio
1.14 has been observed ; for Fig. 6 this is seen to corres-
pond to a=0.6, 3=0.8. It is significant that such a large
amount of admixture of (sp®) orbitals, and hence con-
siderable covalence in tetrahedral sites, only slightly
reduces the axial ratio. In fact pure (sp*) wave functions
for oxygen (a=1, 8=0) still allow enough covalence in
the octahedral sites for distortion to an axial ratio
¢/a=1.10.
