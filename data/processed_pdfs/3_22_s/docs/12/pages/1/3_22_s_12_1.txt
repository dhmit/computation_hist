Dear Phil:

I understand that the computations carried on with
the new IBM 704 Calculator by Mr. Carlos M. Varsavsky
represent the first completed research project on the new
machine. The conclusions from his results are extremely
interesting, and I doubt that they would ever have been
obtained had an extremely rapid electronic computer not
been available. This conclusion denies a statement by
Harold C. Urey in a recent issue of Nature that tektites
could not have origlinated from the moon because if they
had, they would have been distributed uniformally over
the earth. Mr. Varsavsky showed that a fairly wide solid
angle of ejection from the moon coupled with a considerable
range in velocity (about 1 km/sec) could result in a very
sharp line of demarcation between a high concentration of
tektite falls on the earth and a region where none fell.
The results of his calculation will be published in due
course of time,

Thus I should like to express official appreciation,
both from the Department of Astronomy at Harvard College
and from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory for the
fine cooperation obtained from your group in the use of the
new IBM calculator.

Very best personal regards,

Sincerely yours,

   

Director
