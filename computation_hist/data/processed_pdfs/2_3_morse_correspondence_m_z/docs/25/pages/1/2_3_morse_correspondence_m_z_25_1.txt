Dear Professor Cast:

Your May conference on computers sounds like an
interesting one. There are three persons connected with our
activity at the Computation Center who might be useful in
this conference and who might be free to come to Iowa at that
time.

The first is Dr. Frank M. Verzuh. He is the
operating head of our high—speed digital equipment here at
the Institute. For quite a while he operated the Bush
differential analyzer and in the past two years has switched
over to digital operation. He certainly could talk on
present equipment in both analog and digital form and could
give examples of problems which have been solved.

Professor Jay W. Forrester of the Sloan School of
Industrial Management here is another possibility. He was
the chief active spirit in the development of Whirlwind, one
of the first high-Speed digital machines to run smoothly and
deliver results. He then was active in development of the
SAGE system for air defense and this past year has become a
member of the Industrial Administration Department, where he
is investigating the application of machines to business
problems. I have not been able to find out whether he could
come to Iowa in May or whether he would be interested in
taking part. If you could persuade him to come there is no
question that he would have a great deal of interest to say.

Finally, one of our senior graduate students, Mr.
William Jewell, has been spending the last two years in
developing machine techniques for solving actual practical
problems of production planning and transportation routing
which have already had enthusiastic reception by a number
of large companies.

If any of these
follow the matter up 1” yo
be better for you to write

     

h However, it orobably would
the individual yourself.

Sincer ‘v
