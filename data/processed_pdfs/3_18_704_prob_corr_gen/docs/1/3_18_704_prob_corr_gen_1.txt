SUBJECT: M.I.T. Computation Center 704

Last month, the National Broadcasting Corporation spent several hours
at the M.I.T. Computation Center filming the 704 in operation. It

was planned that this would be used as part of the background for one
of the series "World Wide 60", discussing the creation of the universe
and modern astronomy. Some of the discussion will concera Dr. Fred
Hoyle who used the 704 here to perform some of his calculations.

The name of the program is "The Immense Design" part of the series
"Woirld Wide 60". It is scheduled for Saturday, April 2, 9:30 - 10:30 p.m.
on NBC-TYV.

Since the film has not yet been edited we do not know how much of the
footage will be utilized. It will possibly be in the area of 2 1/2 minutes.
The film that was taken shows the operation of the console, console
lights flashing, cards being read, tape units in action, the printer in
action, the core memory unit, etc.
