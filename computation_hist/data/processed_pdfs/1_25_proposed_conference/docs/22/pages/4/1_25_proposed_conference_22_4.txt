3. How Do We Interest Bright Young Students To Enter This Field?

     

 

      

There was a brief discussion on the problem of interesting bright young
students to do their major work in this field, There was an agreed advantage of
having funds for the computing center to allocate to students for thie type of work. ‘
such a policy was carried out extensively at one university, and was not uncommon |
at others, and had proven successfyl. There was also considerable comment thet (
the shortage of personnel in the computer field was a strong incentive. Most of
the difficulties and awkwardnesses revolved about the academic degree reguirements

was an immediate agreement that as long as the b r:.‘.:*'i allocation for
