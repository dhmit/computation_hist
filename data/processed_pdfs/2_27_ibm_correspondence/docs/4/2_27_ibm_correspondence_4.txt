Mr. Arthur B. Bronwell, President
Worcester Polytechnic Institute
Worcester, Massachusetts

Dear Mr. Bronwell:

It is with a great deal of pleasure that I enclose our check
for $800.00 representing the first semester portion of the stipend
for the IBM Research Associate recently appointed for the 1959-60
school year in connection with the M.I.T. Computation Center. A
detailed description of the appointment is attached.

The increasing use of the IBM 704 Computer at MI. T. by
the New England colleges both as an educational device and a research
tool has been very encouraging to 1BM, and we are delighted that
Worcester Polytechnic Institute is having an active part in it as
represented by this research appointment.

_â€” Sincerely

M. Loren Bullock
