Ihis 18 the fourth of an informal exchange of information of particular interest Lo
those New England Universities having IBM 1620's and also participating in the
M.I.T. Computation Center. Contributions to this Newsletter should be sent to
Mr. M. Loren Bullock, IBM Liaison Office, Room 26-=147, M.I. T. Computation
Center, Cambridge 39, Massachusetts. Attached is a current list of the present
members of this New England Univeraities 1620 Group.

I TS TR,

On Wednesday, August 30, 1961, 1l a.m. = 3 p.m., a meeting of all members
of the New England Universities 1620 Group will be held at the new computing
facility at the School of Industrial Management at M.1.T. This is located in
Building 52 on the ground floor in Room 52-031. This is the same building as
the Faculty Club. The meeting will allow for an informal exchange of program-
rning and technical information so bring your print-outs with you. Mr, Harvey
Willson, Director of the S.1. M. computing facility has also indicated that there
will be opportunity to use or see demonstrated their 40K, card-only 1620. This
date is in the middle of the one-week 709/90 Programming Course being given
by the M.I. T, Computation Center, 80 there may be representatives already at
M. X, T, from the New England Universities. Pleass return the attached form
indicating who (or at least how many) will be attending from your group. One
topic of discussion will be the possibility next summer of a 3 or 4-day workshop
on computing in engineering curriculum .

FORTRAN SUBROUTINE COMPATIBILITY 1620-709

 

The use of the final F in subroutine names is required when using 709/7090
FORTRAN. Thus the use of SQR(X) or ATN(X) is not permitted on the 709.
To be consistent with both 1620 and 709/7090 only the following subroutine
names should be used: ‘

SINF(X)

COSF(X)
EXPF(X)
LOGF (X)
SQRF(X)
ATNF(X)

Note also that on the 1620 only one argument is permitted.

LOAD-AND-GO FORTRAN FROM M.,I. T, CIVIL ENGINEERING

A Load-And-Go version of 1620 FORTRAN hae besn developed here, and is
undergoing ''field testing' by our users at the present time. The source language
is identical to 1620 FORTRAN and compiles identical programs. A sample
program, which took eighteen and one=half minutes from loading the processor
to punching the first answer on the standard card system, took only seven
minutes on the load and go system.
