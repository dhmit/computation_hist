Dear Phil,

Gordon Walker Just returned from a trustee and couneil
meeting of the AMS in Chicago and also had a long talk with Taub.
The main conclusion is that the Society will arrange the meeting
In anywhere we decide, without any stipulation regarding time,
place and whether or not #%Â° have formal lectures. The Society
will not regard the meeting as an officially sponsored symposium
since symposia are to be planned for one year in advance by
various committees and there would not be time to have this-
arranged. This does not make any practical difference to us at
all. However, in the light of this it would seem pleasant to
hold the meeting in Allerton House of the University of Illinois
after all, at approximately the date originally intended, and
Taub is looking for available dates right away. We should hear
within a day or so.

I expect you had the circular from Wymore regarding our
Sub-Committee's numbers 1 and 2. I am glad he is starting to
move. As you probably know he is also holding the southwest
universit'X's computing conference at the University of Arizona
on March 18 and 19, I am writing to him to suggest whether he
would get together with as many directors of centers as possible
during that meeting, thrash out preliminary plans and gather
ideas for our conference,

, HAs soon as I hear from Taub about available dates for
Allentown House I shall make an appointment with you through
Miss Hill, TI spoke to Arthur Grad a couple of weeks ago and
he has set the ball rolling on the application. Since you are
on his Committee, this will not be news to you.

Best regards.
Sincerely yours,

pr
