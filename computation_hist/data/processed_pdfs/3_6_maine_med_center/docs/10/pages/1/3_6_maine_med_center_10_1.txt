A concept frequently used in electrocardiology is that of the "heart-vector".
his may be defined as the resultant vector of all the individual current sources and
sinks in the heart. Another concept is that of the "equivalent dipole", which, as we
understand it, is the single dipole which could be substituted for the heart genera-
tor without altering the potential distribution on the body surface. From this point
of View, the resultant dipole is not necessarily synonymous with the equivalent di-
pole. That is, although there may not always be an equivalent dipole, there must
always be a resultant dipole, by definition. If the sources and sinks, or groups of
these, are too widely dispersed throughout the heart volume, the resultant dipole
may not have much physiological significance, but it must exist, nevertheless.

It has been shown (1) that the resultant dipole moment E of a system
of sources and sinks inside a volume conductor can be found by an integration over
the bounding surface of the conductor. In the general case, one has the sum of the
integrals of potential and of normal current. If the surface is metal, potential V
is constant, and normal current only is integrated. If the surface is insulating,

viously applies to the human body, and we have
