Dear Dr. Locke:

It has occurred to me that T could venture to ask your assistance
in getting an opinion of a manuscript which we received for publication,
and which I am enclosing herewith. This book has been revised once, but
I do not seem to have any reading opinion on it., I shall be indebted to
you if you would put it in the hands of a person you think most competent
Lo give a critical review of this proposed monograph.

I hesitate to trouble you,but I am taking the liberty of imposing
on you in this instance.

Thank you for any suggestions you may have.

Sincerely yours,

JAQUES CATTELL

Vice President & Scientific Editor
