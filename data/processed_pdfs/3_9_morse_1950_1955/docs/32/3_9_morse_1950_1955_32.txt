Professor P. M, Morse
Room 6-109

Dear Professor Morse:

I am enclosing a copy of a report entitled
"Statistical Services Progress Report," dated Sept. 20, 1951,
which describes some of the activities of this group. At my
last meeting with Dr. Stratton, he suggested that I keep you
advised regarding the scientific computing activities.

(The Scientific Computation Section begins on page 10,)

In addition, I am enclosing a report prepared by
F. J. Corbato which describes our recent application of the
604 Electronic Calculator to X-ray diffraction studies. This
work is a great improvement over the previous manual and semi
automatic processes,

Since there is some consideration underway regarding
the advisability of publishing the above paper for a wider cire-
culation (provided thisis justifiable), I would like to have
your reaction to the report.

Very truly yours,

F. M, Verzuh
