of the

Committee on Machine Methods of Computation

April 18, 1951

Persons Pressnt: R. R. Bverstt, H. Feshbach, Z. Kopal,
P. M. Morse anu . Reissner

The Mathematics Department reported thzt two 1 people (Miss
Splevek and . Hall) recomme ended for resc arch awaluua;uUzig
for next year had declined. Peissvur recomnended that Mr.

N, J. Hicks be considered as a possibility fer an as ssistantship.
Mr. Hicks had l ‘eady been offered a tcavulnu fvlluxch.p in
Mathematles, but the de partment thought that he would be.a

good powgialgi ty for this posltion. The Comaittee consicored
his case and recommends that the Mothematics Do par?vﬁﬂt cffer
him a choice cf a teaching fellowship in Mathematics or an

assistantgiilp in Machine Cudnutaudnno

Morse showed the letters of recommendation waich had
come in for Mr. Sol I. Rubinow for a post-doctoral assistant-
shlp. The Committee decided to approve his application, and
accordingly receommends to the Phvsics Dﬁyﬁ¢um¢nt that he be
appointed a post-doctoral research assistant in this field for
next year. Presumably he would re port to Professor Feshbach
for his work. The Physics Department will send out the ap-
ﬁClat‘(HC and Morse will write R“Lirawj indicating the n:tuzm
of his assigrments.

There will be uo mﬂ@*¢<g of the Committee next Wednesday,
