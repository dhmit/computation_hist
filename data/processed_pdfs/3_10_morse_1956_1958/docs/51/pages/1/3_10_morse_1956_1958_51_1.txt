Reference: Contract N5ori-06001

Dear Sir:

The Massachugetts Institute of Tseschnology submits
herewith a revised proposal for extension of the reference contract
to June 30, 1957 at an additional estimated cost of $20,960,.00,

We understand that this proposal has been the subject of dlsous-
gions between Professor P. M. Morse of MIT and Mr. A, J. Wise

of ONR=-MIT, Dr. Carl F, Mukenhaupt of ONR-Bogton, and Dr. F. J.
Weyl of ONR--Waghington,

There follows a summary of expsndlitures and funds
remaining on the two projects, Whirlwind Operation and Machine
Methods of Computation, which are currently actlive under the
reference contract:

Project #6345 (Whirlwind Operation) has an unexpended
balance of $97,000 as of November 30, 1955, The current expend-
itures are approximestely $10,000 per month, The average "income"
received for Whirlwind usage is approximately $3,000 per month «-
a net expenditure of $7,000 per month, If it is assumed that the
present level of income ($3,000 per month) is maintalhed during
the nineteen-month period December 1, 1955 to June 30, 1957, a
minimum amount, assuming some tapering off, of $119,000 will be
required during this period.

However, for the purpose of establighing an estimate of
unexpended funds on this project as of June 30, 1956, it 1is esti-
mated that a higher level of income will exist during the remaining
geven months. This may average something abové $4,000 a month., On
this basls we estimate that $57,000 of the $97,000 mentioned above
will remain unexpended as of June 30, 1956, An sdditional factor
affecting the budget shown on page L 4g the estimated Computer
Income for the one-year period ending June 30, 1957. For this period
only $18,000 in Computer Income has becn estimated, This is ine-
flusnced by two factors: one being an expected tapering-off of the
use of the Whirlwind machine by other projects, and secondly the
expected beginning of operations under the IEM Type 704 machins,

Project #6915 (Machine Methodsg of Computation) has an
unexpendsd balance of $71,000 as of November 30, 1955. The current
expenditures are approximately $7,000 per month, If it is essumed
that the present expénditures remalh constant, there will be a balance
of approximately $22,000 on June 30, 1956, In accordance with our
present plang for terminating the ONR support of this project on
Junhe 30, 1956, there will be certaln additional costs extimated at
$7,000 ssgociated with the closing out of this project including such
