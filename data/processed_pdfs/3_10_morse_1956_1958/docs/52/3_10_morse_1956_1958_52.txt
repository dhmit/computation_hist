Dear Joe:

I enclose a six-month report on problems done on Whirl
wind for ONR supported projects here at M.I.T. The report glves
problem, ONR Contract Number, time used and equivalent dollar value,
at our agreed-on charge of #250 per hour, which we charge to othep
projects but do not charge the ONR projects. You will see that:

1. Only 1/3 or less of this time comes from the Project
(6915) which 1s supported by the Math, Division. Nearly all the
rest 18 in support of projects underwritten by the Physics Division
of ONR.

2. That ONR would come out saving money if 1t supported
the programming group directly in the next three years, rather than
for each project to be charged for machine time used, as we may
have to do if we don't get some support of the sort I discussed
with you and Tom last week.

I hope these data are what you need; if you have any
other questions, please write, I'll get an initial proposal for
next year's research to you in the near future.

Yours,

Philip M. Morse
