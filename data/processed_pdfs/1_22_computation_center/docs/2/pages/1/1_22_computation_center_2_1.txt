Dear Sir:

The Nattonal Bureau of Standards is planning, conditional upon
support by the National Science Foundation, to inaugurate a Training
Program in Numerical Analysis for Senior University staff.

The purpose of this program is to give regular university staff,
heretofore specializing in fields different from numerical analysis,
a training in that field which will enable them to direct the operation
of a university computing center, and to organize training and research
in numerical analysis on their return to their own institutions. It
will occupy the whole of the second semester of the academic year
1956-1957 (from February 1l to June 9) and has been arranged at that
time so that narticipants may get familiar with the details of their
own computing equipment during summer and be able to conduct courses
in the acadamic year 1957-1958.

Details of the course are given on the attached sheets. 1In
order that individual attention can be given the number of participants
will be limited to twelve. Selection will be made on the basis of
qualifications of the individual and of the computational program of his
institution by a committee approved by th. Mathematics Division of the
National Science Foundation. Grants will be made to the parent
institution of one half the individual's salary, and the whole of his
travel expenses and subsistence.

This preliminary announcement. is made in view of the short time
for selection of candidates, and consequent re-arrangement of teaching
schedules, in the hope that you can give it some thought at once. If
your department would like to take advantage of this program, please
let us know the names of your candidates at once.

Sincerely yours,
