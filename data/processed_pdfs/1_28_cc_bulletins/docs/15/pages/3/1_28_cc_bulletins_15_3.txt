4. Format Statements read in at object time.

FORTRAN will accept a variable Format address. This
provides the facility of describing a List at object time.

@.g.: DIMENSION FMT (12)
1 FORMAT (12A6)
READ 1, (FMT (I), I = 1, 12)
READ FMT A, B, (C(I), I = 1,5)

Thus A, B, and C would be converted and stored according to the
Format Specification read into the array, FMT, at object time.
