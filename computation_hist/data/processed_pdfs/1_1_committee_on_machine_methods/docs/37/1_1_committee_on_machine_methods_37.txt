The meeting was devoted to discussions of appointments
for the coming academic year. Morse reported that at present
seventeen assistants were on the payroll, that possibly four
of these would not continue next year: Fox, Hicks, Mower and
Newst d, leaving thirteen appointments to be renewed. Analysis
of this year‘s budget indicates that we can probably afford to
support twenty-five assistantships next year; consequently,
twelve new appointments can be made this spring.

For the first round of appointments, the Mathematics
Department recommended R. M. Smith, J. W. Burrows, L. A. Segel,
Pg L. Phipps, P. R“ Klein for appointment for half-time
assistantships beginning next September. The Committee approved
these. The Electrical Engineering Department recommended
E. C“ Hoy who was also approved by the Committee° The Department
of Physics recommended H. Yilmaz, J. T. Harding, Jr., C. O.
Dechandu These also were approved by the Committee.
