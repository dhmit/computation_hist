Dear Dr. Morse:

Thank you for your letter of November 30. We are, of course,
appreciative of MIT‘s pre-emiuence in the field of high-speed
computation. Our thought in making our suggestion was not so much
to do any selling as possibly to present to some uninitiated seg—
ment of your student population the thought that computing offers
some outstanding career opportunities and to give them the views of
a fairly typical industrial installation on practical, down—to—earth
uses of this equipment.

Thanks, also, for your invitation to present a technical paper
at your seminar. We do not feel prepared for this at the moment
but we will certainly remember the offer and hope that it will still
be open in a few months from now when perhaps we will be in a posi—
tion to accept it.

Very truly yours,
