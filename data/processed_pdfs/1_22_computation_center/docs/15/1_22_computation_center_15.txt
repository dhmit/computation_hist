The Chi-Square Integral (Part III)

Before displaying further approximations, let us
present the 'analysis' that went into our choice of
parametric form for the Cross-section fits of Note-20,
We sought a parametric form that would be as useful
in the fitting of cross-sections for low values of

m as for large values of m.

When m is Large

Referring to Fisher, we learn that the Chi-Square
Integral is approximated by

2X 2-om-1
Ut
(1) FE) eo 2° 4s
—- 00

for large m. This suggests that we use a variable
such as

(2) A =~2m-T - +232

in a form such as

(3) FLX) = 4 z
Leah +2220, 03]

 

for approximation over OvE¢n. Our reason for this
choice is that (1) behaves much like a decaying
exponential function of (2) and the right member of
(3) handles such a function very well. But how could
& form like this be used for small m?

When m is Small

The Chi-Square Integral is essentially the Incomplete
Gamma function. Here's a little sample approximation
