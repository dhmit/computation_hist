Dear Mr. Gasteyer:

Your letter of June 22 to Professor Morse has been referred
to me for reply since he is currently on vacation.

 

We will be very happy to have you participate in the educational
aspects of the MIT Computation Center. To assist you, I am enclosing
copies of the following forms:

1. CCF-1: Policy for 704 Computer Usage
2. CCF-2: Application Form for Computer Usage (2 pages)

You should fill out CCF-2, submit to your institutional representative for
his approval and return it to me here at M,I.T.

You should have access to the 704 Programming material,
literature, etc., which has been submitted to Wesleyan, in particular to
Prof. Hing Tong. I am certain that he can assist you during the formative
stages of this work,

I am sorry to inform you that we have no travel funds to defray
the cost of your expenses from Middletown to Cambridge. Again, how-
ever, you should contact Prof. Hing Tong concerning this matter since
he is completely familiar with the financial contributions which have been
made to Wesleyan.
