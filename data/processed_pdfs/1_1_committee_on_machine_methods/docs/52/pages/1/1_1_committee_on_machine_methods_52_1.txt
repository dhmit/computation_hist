‘COMMITTEE ON MACHINE METHODS OF COMPUTATION
Minutes of the Second Meeting
December 1, 1954

Persons Present: C. W. Adams, S. H. Caldwell, S. D. Drell,
J. W. Forrester, P.. M. Morse, J. D. Porter,
B. Rankin, F. M. Verzuh

Adams reported he had been granted a year's leave of
absence, commencing in February, to study machine applications
to business problems, and that Porter would take over the control
of the Whirlwind research activities.

Porter reported that the announcement that time on
Whirlwind is ¢o be paid for has cut down on Whirlwind's use re-
cently and that there is a fair amount of spare time. Several
methods of getting Whirlwind's capabilities known to more of the
Institute faculty and students were discussed. Porter and Morse
are to investigate -farther.

Porter reportod that an extrapolation of the amounts of .
purchased time indicate an income of only about $50,000-70,000 -
next fiscal year, less than half of the amount needed for opcration.

Morse reported that Hildebrand will run a Special Summer
Program in Numerical Analysis June 20 through July 1. Special
attention would be given to machine applications. This program
will, to scme extent, take the place of the programs on Machine
Oporatlons, given 1n past summers by thc Whirlwind staff but not
to ba 31v¢n this summern

Rankin reported on the projeet seminars held this fall
and on the work, of the mathematics wmembers of Phe project, in
numerical analysis. He indicated that this group would like to
be of help in working out toush numerical analysis problems, prior
to machine coding.

The next meeting of the COmmittee will -be 3:00 p.m.,
12 January.
