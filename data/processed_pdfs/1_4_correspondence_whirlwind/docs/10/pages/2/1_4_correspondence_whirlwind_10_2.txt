We thus strongly recommend that the above enumerated costs be reviewed
before approving the total. In this we understand that Dr. F. L. Foster's
office in the DIC will be glad to cooperate. MlMore specifically, we recommend
that our obligations to the Photo Service be met with the following amounts:

Typing, 63 1/2 hours at $1.50/hour $95.25
Everything but typing including 25% overhead 36630
Total for both projects $461 055
Total for each project $230,77

We regret the inconvenience that this might cause but feel that the
presence of the DIC office should aid rather than hinder a careful business
attitude.

Sincerely,
