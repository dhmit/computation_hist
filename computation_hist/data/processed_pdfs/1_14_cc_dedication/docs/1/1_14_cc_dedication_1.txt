April 9, 1957

Mr. James G. Kelso
Exec. Asst. to President
Room 3—208

Dear Mr. Kelso:

Enclosed is a list of persons suggested to
be invited to the ceremonies on June 10 in connection
with the formal presentation of the IBM equipment to
the Computation Center by Mr. Watson.

I include addresses for the non-MIT people.
There are probably duplications in the MIT list,
with other lists you have. I presume you will take
care of these. This does not include the list of

10—12 names of IBM people, which I understand you will
obtain directly from Mr. Blackburn.

Yours truly,

Philip M. Morse, Director
M.I.T. Computation Center
