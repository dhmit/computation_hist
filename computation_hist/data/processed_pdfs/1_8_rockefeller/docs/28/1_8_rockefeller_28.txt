The high-speed computing facility, to be installed by
Ian at the new Computation Center at MIT will be the largest and
most flexible facility in this country to be devoted exclusively
to unclassified research and education. IBH'will contribute more
than a fifthintea million a year in its support for maintenance
and operation. what is needed,in addition, to make this an
outstanding center for the intestigation or digital computer
potentialities in all branches of scientific research. is about
$100,000 a year for the support of a research staff, which can
work with scientists in various fields to develop new and more
effective techniques of machine utilization.

Arrangements have been made for all the colleges in
New England to participate in the use of the machines, and IBM has
set up funds for Aseistantshipe to enable graduate students , at
MIT and at the participating colleges to spend time at the Center,
learning to use the equipment. ./The installation is expected to be
completed by February 1957. Details at the installation and of

arrangements with the participating colleges are given in Enclosures

3 and C to this proposal. This Center and these arrangements
represent potentialities for new developments in social and physical
science of great and unexplored importance.

There will be no charge, for machine time, made to students
or faculty of the participating institutions. Maintenance and the


.2-
routine aspects of operation will be taken care or by IBM, so that
those who know how to use such-squipnent can use it, without cost,
up to the 14 hours a day during which the machine will be avail-
able at first. A number of problems in economies are going to be
put on the machine by Professor 8010!, of MIT, and by Professor
Orcutt, at Harvard and, as other research workers in the social
sciences learn how to use the equipment, other problems will be
brought to the Center.
& Importance 2;, leg; Research ,

> But an instrumentality, by itself, cannot produce new
research. To make the important advances, which are possible
with a computer or the speed and flexibility of this, one needs a
team or research people, some of whom know the machine and some
of whom know the research field. To get exciting new possibilities
beyond the stage or a “gleam in the eye" we need, in addition to
the machine, a staff of experts in machine use, ready to team up
with those scientists who believe the machine can help them but
are not sure how, so that, between them, they can translate the
"gleam inthe eye" into new and important results.

In the long run, the various social scientists in New

England will probably learn enough about machine operation to be
able to make the machine useful to them. But it takes time to
learn to program a machine of this size, and research workers in
any field are reluctant to take much time off to learn new tech-
niques. In addition, to get the most out of a computer, one
should have more than a casual knowledge of the electronic details
of its operation. This combination of knowledge, of a social

science and of a computer, will probably be developed in our next


generation of research workers. But if we went to get started
«me computers in social science 391. we will have to use a team;
a man who knows the field plus a man who knows the mchine.

This last ingredient is the part which is *ett out of the

contribution which IBM has made to the Computation center. To put
the Center at the forefront of research. we must have a full-time
staff of enthusiastic machine specialists. to teach prospective
users how to make the machine do its tricks and to Join with re-
search workers, who come with a ”gleam in their eye," forming
teams which can utilize to the fullest the computer's capabilities
in research. This staff will be hard, but not impossible, to
recruit. We have the beginnings of one formed now, at present
slanted chietly toward research in the physical sciences, and we
have obtained an NSF grant or $35,000 a year for three years to
support it. We have the graduate student bodies of the partici-
pating institutions to pick from and we have already begun to
make contact with those students who are interested in machine
utilization. There are about two dozen IBM research assistants
appointed for this year. We should be able to pick from the best
of these a few who would like to stay on for two or three years
more, after they have obtained their advanced degrees in engineering,

mathematics or science, to be a part of our research staff, potential

members of research teams.

Budget for the Social Sciences

 

To make up a staff which could handle the social science

problems as well as the physical science ones would need another


.h-"
tour or five good men. research nenplus the technicians to back
themﬂup, plus e. small budget toritra‘rel and incidental ewplies-
and eﬁaipnent, approximately ”5.660 a year for three years. It
' would take about three years to get rolling and the developments
should be reviewed at the end of three years, to see where to go
next. Such a staff should be more important during the beginning
stages of the utilization of electronic computers, when the prob-
lems are not too clearly formulated and when neither partner in
., the team knows the others plans and ideas. Later, when some or
the more important potentialities have been demonstrated, the
research can be split up into proJects, each with a definite goal
and with its own budget, which can include partial support for
the continuing staff of the Center. 80, eventually, the Center
could be financed indirectly by contributions from each project
which uses it, if this were considered to be the most desirable
way of keeping it going. At present, however, support by contribu-
tions from established research projects can only support about a
third of the $100,000 needed, which would leave unsupported the
most fruitful research of all, the unknown results which are sure
to come when a machine expert of the Center staff works together
with the economist, psychologist or sociologist, on the faculty
of one of our participating colleges who comes to the Center with
only a "gleam in his eye."
Possible Initial Directions 333 Investigation

As indicated, we cannot write down in any detail the

directions which this research effort will take, as the various

teams are formed and begin to interact. There are several general


-5-
areas which we feel should be investigated, which are certain to
produce results of mediate interest and which. in addition,

should provide hints as to still more important applications.
A. One of these is the deeper investigation of machine

logic itself. A computer of the complexity of the 70% is too big
to be able to see imediately how it can “think." Host machines

are now programmed to do ordinary arittmetie, a few programs have

"ih’een devised to make the machine obey the rules of Boolean logic

 

and some téousht has been spent on working out programs to make tn
machine play chess or checkers, in other words to obey the logic
of a game. Different sciences and branches of learning have

their own kinds of thought processes. For example, economics

and genetics each have patterns of thought which do not exactly
duplicate those of physics. Fundamental research is needed to
work out programs, rules of thought for the machine, which correspond
more closely to these other patterns. with a machine of the
flexibility and storage capacity of the 701%, such research is wort:
while. It will have to be tackled. at the beginning, by teams of
experts in the field of interest, together with mathematical
logicians who know machine operation.

B. Another general line of attack is /€-ﬂe field of the
storage and rapid access to information, such as is needed in the
problems of language translation and historical research, for
example. Several schemes of coding of infomation, so that it can
be found quickly and easily, have been devised on paper, but the
"bugs" in such schemes will only become apparent when masses of
information, of the order of several hundred thousand items, are

to be ordered and sorted out. The new installation at the


computation Center will have , storage capacity of this site. Some
or the proposed schemes should be tried out, and others developed,
by members or the Center staff working with persons familiar with
the intonation and its uaear For example.a proJect in mohine
translation has already been set up, under the direction of
Professor. Locke of the Language Department. is it develops, it
will need the help or machine programing specialists and will
need the use ore machine to that its ideas. The translation
project is already supported by the Rockefeller Foundation, but ‘
parallel'r'uork by the Computation Center on techniques for rapid
access to large-quantity data would help this work as well as
others. Another promising direction of investigation is in the
application of machine techniques to library inventorying,
cataloguing, and record-keeping. Although special-purpose
machines will probably be required in the end, many ideas and
procedures can be developed and checked out on the general-
purpose machine at the Center with the addition, perhaps, of some
specially built input and output equipment. The staff of the

MIT Library is interested in this work and will contribute its
knowledge to its progress.

C. Perhaps the most promising line of advance, in part
because the least investigated up till now, is in the field of
social science experiments, where the computer can be used as
recorder, scorer and referee. Tactical situations in warfare are

already being studied by "gaming techniques" at Hand and in other
military operations research groups. Similar problems in various

fields of the social sciences can also be studied by simplifying


. -7'
the situation down to acne sorter “gamed uith more or less
, complicated rules ,' which can be played by groups of investigators,
"to see what are the consequences or fix-ions strategies. It the
"games" are to correspond, even distantly, to some actual social
situation, the rules mat be quite complicated and the scoring
will require a great deal of'etatistical computation. It has
been found that only by the use of computing machines can the
scoring be speeded up sufficiently so that enough genes can be
run through to provide an overall grasp of the situation under
study. Such "gaming techniques” are cloaely related to the
experiments of Bavelas on the behavior of task-oriented groups.
The use of a properly programmed computer would provide such
experiments with a powerful and flexible means of changing,
controlling, and analyzing these experiments in social psychology.
In this field we could work in close collaboration with the
Center for International Studies at PET and with the psychology
departments in several other colleges.
gagested Guidance _r_oz; t_11_e Research
The research activities or the Computation Center are

guided and coordinated by an Advisory Comittee consisting of
representatives from each or the participating colleges each
chosen by the president of their college. This Committee provides
overall policy guidance in all activities. But to guide the work
in social science outlined above, we will need another, more
specialized group. If financial support for this activity is
forthcoming, about six top-flight social scientists from the
participating institutions will be invited to Join a special advisory


.8-
committee, to talk over possible lines or research with the center

to be done then there 1: inchine tine aveileble. ‘
Eggiment, Personnel and E2253.

The attached enclosures give details of the equipment to
”'be installed in the Computation Center by February or March 1957,
and the arrangements with other colleges in New England. The
suggested budget, for three years, is tentative and is more
dependent on our ability to hire one or two more experts in
computer programming than on the amount or work to be done. If
we can find more men of the right sort, more work can be done.
During the calendar year 1957 we may not be able to find more
than one senior man, one or two post-doctoral fellows and a couple
or technical assistants. By the fall of 1957 we may be able to
persuade one or two faculty members of the cooperating institutions

to spend appreciable fractions of their time at the Center, work?
ing on some or the problems mentioned earlier. A suitable fraction
of their salaries should be carried by the research funds of the
Center and, if the work is in the social sciences, would be charge-
able to the proposed grant. Some of the experiments in "gaming“
will require special input orzgggput equipment. Therefore, it may
turn out that less than $35,000 will be spent the first year; more
than $35,000 the second. The important point, however, is that be—

_ ‘ rue III-.1. r. Computation cents inns been recently
eatahliehed for the purpose or promoting academic research

7 'in the New England area with codern elect ronio digital »
computing machines. As such the-center will make available
to new England Colleges research facilities which hsVe been
heretofore denied because of the large financial and start
obligations required for modern computer operation. To ‘
implement the operation of the Center, the IBM Corporation
is installing a high-speed model 70# computer along with

an extensive set or peripheral machines required for

proper usage. These machines will be operated by the >
Center and will be at its disposal (with the exception‘of
one-third of the 70k computing time which has been temporarily
retained by the IBM Corporation because of the current
shortage of computing facilities.) The remaining two-thirds
of the 70k computing time will be evenly divided between

research at M.I.T. and research at the remaining New England

Colleges.

In addition to the cost-tree use of the 70%
computer, the IBM Corporation will provide machine maintenance
personal and will contribute financially towards the support
or about a dozen technicians required for the effective

operation or the computer. The latter will include two

to promote broad academic familiarity with modern eonpnter
techniques and applications. The individual assistants
and associates will do research 'inxilgtheir respective
specialties, with the general criterion that the work should
lead to results at pnblishable significance. ll'his aspect of
the program will be supervised at the Center by a full-time
research Associate.

The M.I.‘r. Computation Center is under the direc-
tion of Professor P.M. Horse. To advise on general policies
and to help coordinate the program there have been set up a c'
committee of M.I.T. departnental faculty representatives and
a committee of Institutional Representatives from the

faculties of the other New England Colleges. The members

of these two groups also act as supervisors over the activities

The l. .i‘. computation Center rill have its
permanent quarters on the NJ. 1'. Campus in the m Carl '1'. '
Compton laboratory, which is scheduled for completion about
March 1957. In this building the Center will occupy
integrated parts ot the hesemeut, first tloojr and second ’_
floor. This area will have office space for the research
staff, technicians, research assistants and associates,
besides ‘room for the computational equipment used by the
Center. I

The computing equipment of the Center, which
will be furnished by the 1.3.14. Corporation, will-primarily
consist of e 70" computer and the related peripheral
equipment. This machine is an up-to-date, fast, general-purpose
electronic digital computer. The basic machine code
includes over 80 instructions, including those for arithmetic
operations with floating—point numbers. The basic operating
time is an microseconds for most instructions, with a normal
maximum of 21m microseconds. The 701} to be installed will
have a magnetic core memory with a storage capacity or
8192 words, each word containing 36 binary digits. (The
storage capacity will be increased to 32,768 registers in
1958.) The computer will also have, as an additional
storage device, a magnetic drum with a 8192 word capacity.

As with most modern computers, magnetic tape is used both


for additional storage and for inputmtput requirements.

'V:_Thp installstion will have 13_ tape units, (at seat 10 under*~'
computer control), each unit stories up to a maximum of
V900, ooo wax-cu,

, ' In addition to the sometic tape units, the ‘
input-output equipment which will be under direct computer >
control will be a punched card reader. a line-by-line printer, '
e card punch, and a photographic oscilloscope-unit". In
addition there '111 be units, not attached to the computer
directly, for recording csrd infatuation on magnetic tape
and tor reading informsticn from magnetic tepe‘snd printing
or punching cards. Finally, for card preparation purposes,
there will be the usual assortment of standard IBM accounting
machines, including key punches, printer, reproducer, sorter,
etc.

As a further feature the installation will also
include a punched card tranceiver which is a device for
transmitting or receiving punched card information via
telephone lines to remote punched card centers similarly
aquiped with a tranceiver unit.

An additional computer output device planned

for the near future, will be a Photon machine to be

provided by the "ﬁ’PEEEBn incorporated.,nﬁv____n_ This
machine, designed as a high-quality photographic replacement
for periodical and book type-setting, will offer the oppor-
tunity of transcribing computer results directly into better-
than-averase publication form without any human intervention.
Because of the possibility of built-in self-checking, the

process can be made completely error-free. The Photon machine
