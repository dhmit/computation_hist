Waltham, Massachusetts

Dear Dr. Sachar:

It is with a great deal of pleasure that I enclose our check
for $1,500.00 representing the first semester portion of the stipends
for the IBM Research Assistants recently appointed for the 1959-60
school year in connection with the M.1.T, Computation Center. A
detailed description of the appointments is attached.

The increasing use of the IBM 704 Computer at M.I1.T. by
the New England colleges both as an educational device and a research
tool has been very encouraging to IBM, and we are delighted that
Brandeis is having an active part in it as represented by these research

 

appointments.
Sincerely SY 8,
M. Loren Bullock
