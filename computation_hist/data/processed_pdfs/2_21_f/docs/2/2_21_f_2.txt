Pesr -sir:

I am interested in entering the M.I.T. graduate school in
September, 1964, and I would like to request information as
to the availability of part time vositions at your installa-
tion and financial help to graduate students in the computer
sciences. I would also be interested in the possibility of
full time work this summer.

I have a Bachelor of Arts degree 1n mathematics from The

University of Texas. I am participating in an ‘information
processing graduate program under the directorship of Dr.
Robert K. Lindsay, Assistant Professor of Psychology, as a
first year graduate student at Texas. I have studied in the
areas of pattern recognition, came-playing machines, simula-
tion of neural nets, theorem-proving machines, problem solving,
learning, information retrieval, mechanical translation of
natural languages, simulation of cognitive processes, symbolic
logic, and linguistics. My programming experience in these
areas includes work with IPL-V and participation in o current
project to create and implement a new lisT processing language.
