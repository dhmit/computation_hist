A PERIODIC ALGORITHM FOR CUBIC FORMS *

By Harvey Conn.

1. Introduction. In a very famous memoir in 1896,
set up a continued fraction type of algorithm for the
linear homogeneous forms in three integral variables. By the precedent set
in the ordinary theory of binary quadratic forms, such an algorithm has to
supply a definition of reduced form with several properties: Fir
form should be equivalent under unimodular change of var

e conjugates, each spanning a (totally
real) cubic module, the number of distinct reduced forms should be finite.

Probably the most immediate application of such an algorithm would be the
determination of units of a totally real cubic field as
the finite chain of forms.

The purpose of this work is to present a new algorithm for such cubic
forms, combining some of the features of an ordinary (modified) continued
fraction algorithm with some of the features of Minkowski’s algorithm. This
new algorithm follows the former one to the extent that reduction is based on
a visually convenient array of ++ and — signs rather than on admissible ”
bodies; and it follows the latter algorithm to the extent that the proof given
here for the reduction theorem uses Minkowski’s work as a convenient starting
point. Once the theoretical aspects are established, it will be seen that the

actual calculations in cubic fields are very simple, although the units obtained
there are far from thoroughly investigated.

2. Modified simple continued fraction algorithm. The familiar simple
continued fraction (for binary quadratic forms) of course fulfils the above
requirements par excellence. We present a modification to emphasize some
curious resemblances to the definition of reduced forms that we presently
give for cubics. The quadratic form may be written

We recall that a lattice is said to be admissible with respect to a Convex

body K (or vice versa) if no point of the lattice except the origin is interjy
to K. The convex body which we use is the rectangular parallelopiped:

(3.1) P(&, 6) | Ti | = &.

The lattice we use can be written as
(3.2) z= bum; + bizm2 + isms, mj integral, i, j =1,2,3.

Its determinant D is assumed == 0, and we henceforth make the simplifying
assumption that none of the components x,, x, or x; shall vamsh for any
vector of the lattice except the origin. This fits in conveniently with the
intended application, where the triple (bi, bis, bis) spans the totally red
cubic field K; (where the index ¢ denotes the conjugate).

We consider an ordered triple of lattice vectors (4,4, 4s), wher
di = (2,9, 2,0, 2,). We call such a triple Minkowskian if P(z,", z,), 2,1)
is admissible. Such triples exist under very broad assumptions ([2]) aud
from Minkowski’s algorithm ([5]) such a triple is either co-planar ord

Remark. It seems that some significance was attached to the 3 X 3
array of signs of == A; by Minkowski [5], but the role of a fourth vector was
not considered.

Proof. We can without loss of generality multiply the 4; by constants
and reflect the coordinate planes so as to have

(5 11) ay =1, | aij | <1 if 155), a2, > 0,05 > 0,
(5 12) Ay = (1, a12, 1s), A2= (an, 1,03), A3= (31, Asa, 1).

Now the hypothesis that 4,, 4., 4; is a Minkowskian basis requires,
mong other things, that the 20 vectors = A; = 4; (15%)), = 4, = 4, = 4,
J on oF outside the cube |; | < 1. So from here on, we weaken the hypo-

6. Alternative form of the reduction theprerh. We have shown that
every basis is equivalent under change of basis to a reduced basis. It is no
Joss of generality to assume that the change of basis Invelves a matrix of
determinant + 1 (as all basis vectors can be multiplied by — 1 without
affecting the definition of reduction). Likewise We Miay assume by (4.21)
that Bi, B., Bs; are S, P, @ respectively. Finally we divide each 2; by a
constant so as to put the lattice in inhomogeneous form, whence b,; =1.
Then calling ba = &, bai =i We obtain the following result:

formed using only + §
the inequalities in (5.11)

Let three nmon-collinear points (&,mi) of the projective (&n)-plane be
given in some fixed order. It is possible to find an integral unimodular trans-
formation such that the points (&, mi) simultaneously go into the points (£4, 7's),

(6.2) B,: £=0,7.=0, 146+ 9=0;
Ry: £=0,7=0, 1+ & + 793=0.

Note that in order to cope with our previous lattice restriction (that no

lattice vector have a zero component except the origin), we must extend the
regions to the projective plane, thus permitting division by zero.

G1) 2; det (a bsc3) = +1

7. Cyclic basis. A very important type of lattice is one with a cyclic
basis,

(7.1) bij = ax, where k=1 + j (mod 3) (k=1,2,3).
In this case the ternary form ®, as a function of the my is invariant under
cyclic permutations, and conversely. Here the basis Bj, (j =1, 2,3), (in the

notation of 4) is reduced if and only if, of the four quantities a, ®, %s;
— (9 + a + a5), two are positive and two are negative,

(or oyaaarg (oy + ap + a3) < 0).

 

A PERIODIC ALGORITHM FOR CUBIC FORMS 87

We now single out the “hard case,”

where, under o ro
and (possibly) a change in sign of al] %, a change of indices

we have the inequalities
(7.2) Tt 02 > a> a> a>,

Then, except for the hard case just cited, the c

yelic basis will be finitely

eclors P, Q, BR, § for the
om among the 26 vectors + Bi, + B; + B,
fu ’

The above statement can be easily verified. We further note that the
hard case must be separated since the three numbers 1, %s, ®3 can otherwise be
arbitrarily close to one another and still satisfy the conditions (7.2). There-
fore, even 1f the set of 26 vectors above were extended to any finite set
however large, of the type k;B, 4 IB, + m;B;, it would still be possi
to choose the a; so that of the four desired basis vectors P,Q, RB, 8 the
one (S) which is in the all 4 (or all —) octant would be the one for
which kj; + I; + m; = 0, while the other three vectors would be such that
kj + 1; + mj; = 0, contradicting condition (4.21).

Fortunately, in many applications, the hard case simply does not occur.
For instance, for later reference, take

(7. 3) a = 2, exp (mim/p), (k=1,2,3),

where p (=1mod 3) is a prime and m through a complete set of residues
of cubic character indicated by k. Here a, + a, + a3 = —1, and therefore
if the a; were all of one sign (as in (7.2)), we should have | aa. | = 1/27
in contradiction to the fact that « is an algebraic integer. Hence the lattice
given by (7.1) and (7.3), (determined by contraction of a cyclotomic field),
has a reduced basis very close to the cyclic basis described here.

Finiteness.

8. Norms and discriminants. We now consider the case where the
21, &2, T3 components in (4. 42) are the conjugates of three numbers spanning
a (totally real) cubic field. We shall show that although the neighbor process,
for instance, produces a chain of 3 X 4 matrices (see 12 below), they are
strictly proportional to only a finite number of classes. Thus the ternary and
quaternary forms take on only a finite number of values.

As a preliminary step, multiply through the matrices so as to make all
of the pi, qi, ri, s; algebraic integers. We let A represent the (common)
absolute value of the determinants formed by omitting any one of the four

where G3 (7, Q)) = (1192 Za q:P2)*(Psqa — 7301) (Paqs — q2Ps)>. Since GHP, 2
(3 1s a rational integer, it follows that one column, RE, of the chosen pair R, S,
, has bounded norm. By repeating the argument we see that some three of
the column vectors (say) P,Q, R have bounded norm (as indicated above).
Likewise, regardless of whether R or

(8.5)

S has the bounded norm,

GP, Q) = NX(Q)d(P/Q) = N*(P)d(Q/P);

hence any of the twelve fractions of the

A lattice in three-dimensional space will be called reduced if its basis vectors
zt”, z{°, 23” together with #{° = —3 z{°(j = 1, 2, 3), lie one in each octant
of space or its negative octant. It may be seen that every lattice has a reduced
sublattice of universally bounded index (and the examination of a handful of
cases may even reveal this index to be unity). This type of algorithm is very
similar to one by Minkowski in which the basis vectors were three shortest
independent vectors under certain deformations, and two bases were called
neighbors if they had two basis vectors (out of three) in common, making three
neighbors in general. In the author’s algorithm the bases are “not far” from
Minkowski’s bases, and the process of finding neighbors involves agreement, of
two (out of four) basis vectors. Here there are three to six neighbors in general,
making for more complicated patterns.

Similarly, reduced quaternary forms [I> n:a$? (G=123,4,7i=1,223)
can be defined. If this form is the norm in a totally real cubic module, it can
be shown there are only a finite number of reduced forms under change of basis;
and the neighbor concept will lead to finite (periodic) multi-dimensional struc-
tures. Finding the structures by this algorithm is very simple since it involves
only patterns of signs. For the integers in the cubic field for which D = 49, the
structure of the norm is 8 forms connected like the vertices of a cube. For D = 81
and D = 148, the structures have 16 and 28 forms respectively. Structures with
certain symmetries turn out to correspond to abelian fields, and the periodicity
of the structures, of course, leads to unities of the field.
