VARIABLE Bcunos MEMORY PROTECTION
_______..~_—._—_________~_____i

Two rcvrsters are providedn designated the Lower and

prp' Registers. When in the protection mode, any CPU
'gguerated memory address, including "1" cycles, is compared
against these two registers. The comparison is made after
relocation» if any» If the address is less than the con«
tents of the lower register or greater than the contents
of the Upper register, a trap is generated, storing the
actual (unrelocated) value of the instruction counter

in location 32 and transferring control to location 33.
The execution of the instruction causing the trap is
blocked. In addition, execution of any trap will take

the CPU out of both the protection and relocation mode,
leaving the contents of the registers unchanged.

Two instructions are provided:

M1) Set Protection Mode Y

and 21=27 of Y into the Upper and Lower register,
reSpectively. In addition, the CPU is placed in the
protection mode. The protect mode, however, does not
become effective until after the instruction following
the SPM has been executed. In additiong no I/b traps

Execution of this instruction will place the contents

of the Upper and Lower Registers in positions 3=9 and
21~27 of Y, respectively. If in the Protection Mode,

2 "1" will be stored in position 2 of Y0 The instruction
is indexable and indirectly adoressable.

Tragging

When in the protection mode, execution of the following
instructions will cause a trap:

Set Protect Mode

Set Relocation Mode
