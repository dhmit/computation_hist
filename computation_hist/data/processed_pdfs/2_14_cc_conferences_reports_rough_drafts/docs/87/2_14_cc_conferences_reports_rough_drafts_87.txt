Dear Professor Morse,

It was good to see you at the Corporation meeting.
I am sorry we did not have longer to discuss your pro-
position for new machines. We have been extremely
happy with our relationships with M.L T. since the com-
puter program started, and we are most appreciative of
all the cooperation we have received from you and your
associates.

As you know, the total program represents a con-
siderable investment on IBM's part, and we feel that
with the programs you have underway, this investment
will pay great dividends in the future, both for the Institute
and for our company. We are under substantial pressure
for the transistorized machines, and I know that in
talking with our people you will recognize this problem.
On the other hand, I am excited about the possibility of
several departments using the machine through remote
consoles, and this might be quite a significant piece of
pioneering for both of our organizations.

I hope you will keep in touch with me as the situation
progresses and that if I can be of help at any time, you
will not hesitate to call on me.

Sincerely yours,

eh Oa Tes

Professor Philip M. Morse
