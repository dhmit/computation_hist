contains the symbolic instructions in the order given
together with the octal representation of the binary
words generated. Errors detected by the assembler
result in error flags. An error flag is a code letter
placed in the left margin of the line containing the

offending instruction. The code is as follows:

Phase error or phase relocation error
Reference to an undefined symbol
Reference to a duplicately-defined symbol
Undefined code in the operation field

OO B GRS Y

Boolean error (non-Boolean symbol in a Boolean
field)

Relocation error

Error in a data-generating pseudo-operation
(DEC, OCT, BCIl, BCD, or VFD)

L Error in a literal

Several features have been added to FAP to improve the
assembly listing. If the card immediately following

the COUNT card contains an asterisk in column 1, the
contents of column 2-72 of this card will be printed at
the top of each page of the listing, together with the
page number, If the card following the COUNT card does
not contain an asterisk in column 1, it will be treated as
a normal operation or pseudo-operation, and only the page

number will appear at the top of each page of the listing.

The list-control pseudo-operations SPACE, EJECT, UNLIST,

LIST, TITLE, and DETAIL have been added to the assembler.

The SPACE pseudo-operation causes blank lines to appear in

the listing. The value of the variable field is the number

of blank lines to appear, except that if the value of the
variable field is zero, one blank line will appear. The

EJECT pseudo-operation causes the assembler to begin a new
page. The UNLIST pseudo-operation causes the assembler to
suspend listing until a subsequent LIST pseudo-operation is
encountered. When UNLIST is in effect, any line which contains

an assembly error will
