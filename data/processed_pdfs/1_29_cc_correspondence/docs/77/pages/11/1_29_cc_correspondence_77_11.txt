Although "/" is usually an operation involving only one term,
by convention "A/B" is taken to mean A*/B. Thus the table for

"/" as a two-term operation is

0/0 = 0
0/1 =0
1/0 = 1
1/1 =0
Other conventions are:
+A = A+ = A
-A = A- = A
A = A* = 0 (one operand missing)
A/ â€”=CA
| o=
=0 (both operands missing)
/ = JTTT177777777

The above tables define the four Boolean operations for one-
bit quantities. The operations are extended to 36-bit
quantities by the rule that each bit-position is treated
independently. Note that the leftmost 18 bits will either

be all zeros or all ones. A Boolean expression is evaluated
