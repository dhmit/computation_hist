Kopal reported that the situation was not yet clear about
Verzuh or Salzer. Tho Committee felt that Verzuh should teke
139 this term, bub verzuh hes not yet gotten clear snough of his
various duties to be able to carry this and teach his course and
tekeo M39 and do his thesis. Nevertheless the Committee felt 1t
wes better for him to sign up for M39 now and to work toward a
lightening of his duties: if this turns out to be impossible, to
cancel M39 later. It appeers only to welt action by Stratton to
cloopr the matter up. In salzer's cese his supervisory committeo
