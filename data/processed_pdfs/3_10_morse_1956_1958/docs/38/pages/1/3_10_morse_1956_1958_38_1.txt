The present plan is to have the formal lectures in Room 2-180

(capacity 200) each morning. However, this room is reserved for our
use all day long =0 {hat we may schedule a number of afternoon lectures.
Unfortunately 2-190 is not air conditiomed, but it does have lantern
projection facilities which will be of value during the conference.

The space in Building 52 consisting of eight (8) rooms on the
first floor will allow us to accommodate a group of 100 with an average
of about 12 persons per reom. Since each roon con handle at least 16,
we are again safe aos far as capscity is concerned.

Thig arrangement will be satisfaciory siuce the morning lectures will
be held in Building 2 followed by luncheon at the Faculty Club at noon,
and then the afternoon segsion on the first floor of Building 52.
