COMMITTEE ON MACHINE METHODS OF COMPUTATION |

Minutes of the Third Meeting
January 25, 1956

Persons Present: D. N. Arden, H. Feshbach, F. B. Hildebrand,
J. A. Hrones, C. C. Lin, P. M. Morse,
B. Rankin, F. M. Verzuh

Morse reported the progress of the plans for the new
Computation Center. He reported that IBM was contributing g30,000
for Research Assistantships and Associateships starting next fall,
which would take the place of the ONR Assistantships. The arrange-
ments for application and appointment would be the same as before,
but the men would be expected to spend more of thelr time definitely
helping out in the work of the Center, spending a definite nuwber
of hours a week at the Center. :

Morse also reported on the various training courses on
704 operation which will be given this summer: 1.) a three-week
course given at M.I.T. and IBM the latter part of the summer and
2.) a ten-week course in New York (information sheets were dis-
tributed concerning this course). Morse said Truman Huntcr was
coming from IBM to handle details of arrangements. He would be
avallable here for consultation in a couple of weeks. Further in-
formation on all this will be sent the committee in the near
future.

Morse also reported the development of a cooperative
program with other schools in New England (see copy of minutes
enclosed). He also reported on developments in applying for funds
from ONR and NSF for support for research in numerical analysis
and in programming techniques.

Morse asked that the committee members find out how
many persons in their department will wish 1.) ¢o apply for the
Assistantships and Assoclateships and 2.) to take one of the
704 training courses this summer. At the next meeting of the
committee, in February, we can begin to get a picture of the

numbers involved.
