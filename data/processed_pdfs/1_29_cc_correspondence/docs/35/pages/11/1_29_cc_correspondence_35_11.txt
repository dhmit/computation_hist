B. Yortran Programs Containing SAP-Coded subroutines

SiP-coded subroutines involving no input or output
are almost directly convertible into FLiP, the Fortran issembly
Program, since the 704 instructions are (with one exception,
TQO) a subset of the 709 Instructions, and FAP retains the
ma jor pseudo-ops of SAP, i.e. â€˜U, 0OCT, DEC, BSS, BES, and
BCD (n.b. the specification of BCD is slightly changed).

several pseudo-ops hiave been included in FAP that
make the machine coding of Novtran progrems simpler than it
was in SAP.

Prograwms that included input-and/or output must

be partially rewritten using the 709 commands.
