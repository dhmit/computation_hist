From ¥,.li.llorse, Director Ii. I. T. Computation Center,

Subject: Replaceuent of 704 by a 7090,

Background = In June, 1957, somewhat less than three years
ago, al, 704 wes installed at the Computation Center by IBI, under
a special agreement whereby IBI maintains the equipment, contrie
butes toward anortizing the additions to the Compton Hehorateny
which house the Center and supports a number of res arch, aBmon
ciliates who assist users of the machine, and pT stafif# and oper
ates the Center for the use of LIT and other cooperating New
England colleges and universities, The brimary purpose of the

college as are chenistry laboratories, for Xample. A secondary

purpose is to foster research in the use of computing machines,
particularly in those fields of applicstion which have not yet
been explored or exploited fully,

To this end, priority on 704 time has been accorded to

special ceding courses which are given by the Center staff during
cach term and summer. A number of other collegen bring some of
their classes in for one or more laboratory sessions, Class use
will expand further, but its expansion will be haipered by the
linitations of access Go the 704, as will be discussed later,

The use of the machine by the other cealleges has expanded
rapidly until nearly a full shift is now cccupied with their work
(including their class exercises). But this use tents to be self=-
Pr for, as soon as a college faculty begins ful.y to apprec-
ate the possibilities in education and research of coma the

pressure builds up for a machine of their owa on thelr own campus,
By now at least eight of the cooperating institutions yes = a
of their own. These are smaller machines, of the 650 Byrn "50 ppd),
ese instituions still come to the Center to use the 704 for their
bigzer jobs; but it does mean that the use of the Center ly the
other New fngland colleges will tend to level off to a reejonable
load (about one shift, it now app pears) rather than growing sontin-
uously, as the HIT usage is doing. This result, of course, is in
accord with our conviction that computers should be as prevent
as chemistry laboratories.
In contrast, the LIT use of the 704 for research into isw
ications has grown so that now we are not able to satisfy 11

the experiment or the scientist can go on to the next step and
request the next computation in turn. On the 704 this would
reguire the exclusive use of the machine, though only a fraction
of the 704 speed would be used; obviously again, time-sharing
techniques are needed, |

These, and many other programs now in progress, such as
the character-recognition studies ~~ © _ , the research
cn economic forecasting end on operational behavior using large-
scale simulation techniques, should be of particular interest to
LB, for they have direct bearing on the progress of computer
design and utiliza tion, They represent the sort of cooperative
research between experts in different fields which KIT does so
effectively, and they involve the combination of research and
education for which ilIT is pre-eminent. This work deserves
support by IBil, in addition to the educational activities which
are already being SiBpoT ad So the present contribution of the 704,
They can most effec tivaTalin the installation of a 7090, replacing
the 704, in the near future; IIT will then be able to provide
the «aE=eme ancillary equipment to push ahead with dispatch.
Because of the "inter-connectedness" of much of this research,
it can best be carried out (perhaps it can only be carried out)
in the atmosphere of mutual cooperation and exchange of infor-
