Dr. Joachim Weyl

Office of Naval Research
Navy Department
Washington, D. C.

Dear Dr. Veyl:s

In accordance with our telephone conversation last week,
I am sending you our most recent estimate of plans and costs of
operation of Whirlwind I for the next two years. This can be taken
up in two parts: the one concerning the operation of Whirlwind I
and the support of its necessary maintenance, programming and ade
ministrative staff (DIC project 6345); the other concerning the
general research and training program designed to extend the use
of digital computers in scientific and engineering research at the
Institute (DIC project 6915).

Project 0915 - Taking up the second part first; the goal
set up in our St proposals to ONR, to make faculty and students
aware of the usefulness of high-speed digital computers by investi-
gating applications in many fields, is well on its way to attain-
ment. Graduate students and faculty supervisors in most departments
of the Institute (Blology being the major exception) have investi-
gated applications of wachine methods to problems in their own
fields and are in the proesess of obtaining results worthy of pub-
lication in their own field's journals. This part of the program
was originally set up for a yearly budget of $100,000, but the

rate was reduced to $80,000, at the request of ONR, before the
project had reached ite criginally plammed full strength. It is
now estimated that about $70,000 will remain in the budget of this
project by June 30, 1955; consequently, it will be able to continue,
at about its present level of aetivity, for only one further year,
unless further funds are provided.

But it is quite possible that most of the aims of sush
a general research program will have been attained by June 1956

42% the worthwhile parts then active should each de supported,
cparate projects, by funds from various sources. Now that the
sibilities of machine use are known by faculty and students,
wther support of research using machines can perhaps be provided
sn the strength of the importance of the research itself, rather
than because of ite interest as a problem in machine coding. Some
of these research projects may be supported by industry, some may
still need support from ONR, but the support need not all come from
‘the Mathematies Division of ONR; the other divisions, interested
in the research, should contribute their share. Consequently, no
additional funds will be requested for DIC 6915 at this time, Next
summer the situation will be re-assessed and a final decision as to
its future will then be made.

Project 223 - The situation with respect to DIC 6345,
the operation o wind I itself, 1s quite otherwise. This
equipment is the only high-speed digital computer available at
present for general research at the Institute. Unless enough
funds are available to pay for maintenance, operation, programming
and scheduling, no research requiring machine computation of this
sort will be possible at the Institute and the goal set by the
other part, project 6915, would be nullified. At present WW1l is
supported in part by Lincoln Laboratory and in pert by ONR. The
tiwe not used by Lincoln, whieh is used by workers in project 6345
and in the general research and educations) activities of the Ine
‘stitute, is equivalent to abeut 40 hours a week, full one-shift
operation of the machine. The ¢os® not born by Linsoln héve been
trimmed to about $160,000 per year. The problem 18 how to provide
this amount during June 1955-June 1956 and how to provide the
LSTESY Smount to keep going later if Lincoln should withdraw its
supper ° : 3

Jr One possibility would be to charge each user proportionally .
to his use of the machine, irrespective of the nature of his work.

This, of course, would have thesresult of discouraging most thesis

research and general faculty use of the machine, thus nullifying

the resulvs of the efforts of projeev 06915, which was set up, in

pert, to stimulate this interest. Another possibility would be

to charge those users who sould afford it (the sponsored projects)

enough to pay for the full $160,000 needed for the next fiscal

. year and toc allow thesis and general educational research free time.

. Costs to other ONR Projects - But this year somewhat more

"than one half of the sponsore » non-Lincoln) work done on WW1l

was done for various ONR projects carried on at the Institute.
Quite a bit (3-5 hours a week) was done for the project on Selid
State Physies under Professor Slater; much time is used by the

; Laboratory and 80 on. Therefore, if ONR decided
/t project 6745, direstly, it would have to add about #100 000
ar to the budgets of several other of its projects at if
aished them to continue at their present rate; for each of these
ojects, now gating frie time on WWl, would have to contribute
neir share directly or not have the use of WWl. But such com-
pletely piecemeal supprrt 18 not healthy for continuous operation
of a facility like Wil. The staff is at the mercy of chance
fluctuations of demarsis and comsequently is often tempted to take
on purely commercial computing tasks, for cutside firms, to tide
over a 8lask period.

    

   

~ Suggested Svlution for 1955-1956 - The better solution
would be for ONR vo mire 1Us contribution in a single sum, so that

o

the various ONR projrete at MIT need not pay extra for WW1l time,
and then to scherge "he nou-0NR, non-Lincoln, sponsored projects
enough for their uvre of the facilities and staff so that Whirlwind
can afford to deveie some of its time to gencral educational re-
search without chirge. Such a system of charging has already been
worked out and »:5 been gone over with the ONR fiscal officers
the sharges are $250 per hour for machine time plus extra sharges
for extra time of the programming staff and for extra use of output
equipment. (ir present estimate of the number of non-ONR non-
Lincoln spor:ored projects willing and able to ecntribute in this
way indiesv:8 that we should be able to carn about $60,000 during
1955-1956, Sueh support would, of course, be subject to the
fLlustuati ns mentioned above, but these fluctuations would now be
in a min =ity fraction of the total budget rather than in the
major prt, and hence would not be s0 large in magnitude. This
ameun’ represents a reduction in use of WW1l Dy non-ONR projects,
below the level of last year, because a number of thess projects
‘geno afford to pay charges of this size undar thelr present
v.getis. In other words, the imposition of such charges will
jrerense this type of work to about 1/3 of the total sponsored

not including Linsoln) cone oa Will. It is
psssible thet this fraction will incregse again as theese other
oro jeste cone to include computer charges in their future budgets,
"45 418 unlikely that much increase 1will come in 1955-1956.

Weyl lo January 17, 1955

Pogsibili Lies after June 1956 - The longer range pros-
re much more vague, of course, If Lincoln Laboratory
,0 stop 16s support, it would cost about $250,000 a year to
WWl 3 running effec eotive ly on a one-shift, 40 hour-a-week basis.
Jounteract this, the non-ONR project support might be increased
4100 ,000 a year. In adds ition, the Institute is endeavoring to
stain general’ support from industry, to supplement the present

JAR support and, we hope, eventually to superscde it. Perhaps by

1956 this support could amount te about £50,000, though this is
only & hope as yet. :

The most optimistic estimate ee be to expect that,

though Lincoln will not ppive tho support t gives now, it still
1111 contribute enough so that only $200, 000 a year extra would

and general industrial sontribut ions of $50,000 a year could be
raised, then only $50,030 to $70,000 would be needed to carry through

Further extrapol ation beyond this date 1s obviously

endation = It is therefore recommended that ONR

 

grant an nal 20,000 to $30,000 to be used in 1955-1956
for WW1l operating budget (1.e., Supplementary funds for project
DIC 6345), that g50,000 to $70,000 be tentatively allosated to

6345 for 1956-1957, that no further funds be allocated for project
pt ~ re

6915, and that in December 1955 the situation be re-avaluated to

ee what later ne¢ds will be,

If this can be done, it will be possible to furnish come
puting tne free to ONR pro jests at the Insts ltute, as well as to
general educaticnal research here, for another ye ar, and there
will be no need to take on Jobs outside the Institute to keep
WWl running in 955-1956. (Note: Free time on Whirlwind is only
granted by the Institute Interdepartmental Committee on Numerical
Analysis and lMrchine Computation; thus, free time is not Just
granted for th: ask ing, only worthwhile research projects are
allowed time.

I hope that this exposition answers the questions you
have raised /nd that you can reach a decision in the near future.
If you agree with my recommendations, let me know, and I will
arrange for the proper official proposal to be sent to ONR.
