Dear Alan:

In June I sent you the manuscript of the report of
the Conference of University Computing Center Directors, which
you had suggested could be published in the Communications of
ACM. I have not heard from you as to whether you received
this manuscript, as to whether it is to be published, and when.
Could you let me know what the status is? In a letter accompany-
ing the manuscript I mentioned that we might want to obtaln a
falr number of reprints. Since the original copies of the report
are now all distributed we are anxlous to know whether we will
be able to distribute reprints. Consequently, I would appreclate
hearing from you.about this also.

As one editor to another may I suggest that a routine
acknowledgment of manuscripte sent to the Communications of ACM
would be appreclated by many contributors?

Yours,

Philip M. Morse, Director
