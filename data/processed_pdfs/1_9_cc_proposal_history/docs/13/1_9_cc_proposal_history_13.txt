List of Ideas for Research Projects

1. Algebraic and logical compiler

Development of a routine capable of translating to and from
computer coding and algebraic notation,

Possible including some automatic selection of numerical
techniques and automatic error analysis,

/ 2. Investigetion of Structure and Syntax of possible input languages

3. Coding of Tarski's decision method for elementary algebra and geometry,

 

4, Investigation of microprogramming and other methods for increasing thd
flexibility of computer design, |
