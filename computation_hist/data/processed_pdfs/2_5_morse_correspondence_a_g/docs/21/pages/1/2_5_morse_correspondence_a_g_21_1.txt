Dear Professor Martin:

Along with nearly all orgenizations such as ours, W€ suffer from
a drastic shortage of competent technical people. We have found that
one of the best ways to alleviate this shortage is to expand our use of
gutomatic computing machines. These machines relieve our highly trained
technical personnel of many routine tasks so that they can devote thelr
+time to creative efforts.

However, expanding the use of automatic aids has created 1ts own
problems. The effective utilization of these automatic aids itself
demands the services of highly qualified +echnical people. It thus might
be argued that we have only "robbed Peter to pay Paul,"” but we feel that
one competent man 1n this activity can be of such assistance to our tech-
nical staff that our problems can be solved with a minimum number of
+rained personnel.

describe the work TO appropriate groups of college stuaents. Please note
+hat this will not be a part of our effort to attract competent graduates
+o Douglas, but will be a technical talk on the applications of electronic
computing equipment.

We hope that our representatives can speak for about forty minutes
at times which would not interfere with college activities. The talks

could be +gilored to an gudience, from freshmen to graduate students,
