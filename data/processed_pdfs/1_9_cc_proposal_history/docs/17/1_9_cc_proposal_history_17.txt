Continuation of Contract N5ori06001 (DIC 6345 and 6915)
beyond the current expiration date of April 30, and June 30, 1956,
respectively.

ONR Contract NSoriO6001

 

In accordance with our conversations with the following
ONR Representatives:

Mr, Alfred J. Wise, ONR Contract Administrator, MIT
Dr. Carl F. Mukenhaupt, Chief Scientist, Boston
Dr. F Joachim Weyl, Dir. Math Sciences Div., Washington

we recommend applying to ONR for an additional $20,000 to
supplement the expenditure of Project 6345 for the fiscal period
1956-1957.

Project 6345 (WHIRLWIND Operation) has an unexpended
balance of $97,000 as of November 30, 1955. The current expenditures
are approximately $10,000 per month. The average income received
for Whirlwind usage is approximately $3000 per month -- a net
expenditure of $7000 per month. If it is assumed that the present
level of income ($3000 per month) is maintained during the 17-
month period December 1, 1255 to June 30, 1957, a minimum amount
of $119,000 will be required during this period.

Project 6915 (Machine Methods of Computation) has an
unexpended balance of $71,000 as of November 30, 1955. The current
expenditures are approximately $7,000 per month. If it is assumed
that the present expenditures remain constant, there will be 2
balance of approximately $22,000 on June 30, 1986. In accordance
with our present plans for terminating the ONR support of this
project on June 30, 1956, there will be certain additional
terminating expenditures. It is estimated that $7,000 will be
expended for termination purposes.

. The expected arrival of an IBM Type 704 Electronic Data
Processing Machine at MIT about January 1, 1957 will create a
definite need for additional funds to finance the conversion of
existing WHIRLWIND programs to Type 704 programs.
