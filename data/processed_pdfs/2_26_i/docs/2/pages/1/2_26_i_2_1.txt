Dear Professor Forrester:

Thank you for your letter of January 22 and for the interesting
discussion of the research in industrial dynamics being conducted at the
School of Industrial Management, I am happy to inform you that we shall
be very pleased to make a grant of fifty hours of 704 time from the IBM
shift during the academic year 1959-60, As I explained during our discussion
on this subject, this grant is being made in recognition of the fundamental
character of your research and with the understanding that all results of
this work will be published and freely available to interested parties, We
shall, of course, expect to receive these publications as they appear,

Mr. M. L. Bullock, ABM Representative at MIT, will be very
happy to schedule the time for you as you require it,
