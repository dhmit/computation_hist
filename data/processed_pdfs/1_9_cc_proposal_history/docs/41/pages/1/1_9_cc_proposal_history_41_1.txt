1. Present Situation - Two separate inatallations (Whirlwind and
IBM, located apart and with separate staffs. Present budget
(approximate, including 40 per cent overhead charge on salaries):

A. VWhirlwind (excluding Lincoln use, but including
full-time programming research staff) g175,000 per year

B. IBM (excludiﬁg machines and staff used for MIT
administrative services but including rentals
for rest of IBM equipment) . 85,000 per year

C. Funds to support research assistants learning
. use of machines and aiding in programming 70,000 per year

Present Total $330,000

B 1s now financed by charging those DIC projects which can afford
it and giving the rest of the time free for class training and
Thesis research. C 1is now financed by a grant from ONR which will
terminate in June 1956. 4 is now financed in part by charging
those DIC projects which can afford it and, for the rest, by an
ONR contract which also terminates on June 1, 1956.

Disadvantages of Present Arrangement - Two group, separate loca-
tion, w some duplication of man-power and considerable loss in
effectiveness. All present equipment going out of date, will not
satisfy Institute needs in two years (see previous memo, attached).

Proposed Reorganization - The proposed new center for Gomputer Re-

search and Training would be built around an IBM 704 computer and
auxlliary equipment, to be donated by IBM. IBM would use it for

two of the four daily shifts (the night ones) and we would have

full use for the other two shifts (about 80 hours a week working
time). This equipment would have more capabilities than our present
two sets of machines and the two shifts should take care of our
educational and research needs for several years to come. The
budget for this center would be approximately:

D. IBM Rental (which includes provision for
operators and maintenance personnel provided by
IBM) at commercial rates, for comparison g400,000 per year
