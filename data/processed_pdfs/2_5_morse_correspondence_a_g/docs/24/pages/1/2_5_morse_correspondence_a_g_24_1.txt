Doar Jny.

 

am sure that ycu.will bo relieved that I haxe persuadeo thn
Computation Center people to take over this chore and Frank
Verzuh will probably do it. However, we would like to reaf-

- firm the iInvitation to you to take Jlunch with this grouvp in
dining room 3 at 12:00 m, together with Rdlph Treaman as host
and one¢ or %twe other colleagnas. ‘

Whetiuer or not “70&“ will be ready tc show off by that time
we cannot now predict, but in any case it seesms appropriate
that the Computation Center people who sre charged with
needling the economists intc the appraciation of the uses of
n7ou" should carry the ball on this occcaszion,

The Reglstry of Guests has been completely at sea in the whole

metter and has not yet found out from Mr, Dickson the nature
or the preclse number of who is coming and why,

Sincerely yours,

" John W, M. Bunker
Adviser toc the President
