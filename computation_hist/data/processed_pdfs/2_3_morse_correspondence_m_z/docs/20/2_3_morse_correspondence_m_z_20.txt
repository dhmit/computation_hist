Dear Professor Morse:

1 wish to express my appreciation to you for the very worthe
while seminar which a group of officers from the War College
attended at M.I,T. on 13 November.

The members of the group were most gratified by the interesting
and informative presentations on electronic calculations and
the demonstration of "Whirlwind." Information gained from these
presentations will be beneficial to our Advanced. Study Group in
its study of research methods. | FAR

Your efforts in arranging this seminar are greatly appreciated.
| Sincerely yours,
