GENERAL CONCLUSIONS

Computer scieance is & new scientific field and computing centers are recent

 

sdditions to institutes of higher learning. This was the first conference to discuss in
detail curricula related to computer science, as well a8 the administrative and financial
problems of computing centers in universities. Undoubtedly the greasteat value of the
meeting was in the interchange of ideas between the participants, ezch learning how
others had solved their problems. Of course, there were many different points of view
and many disagreements on details. Some of these points of view are reported in
Appendices D to H.

On & number of basic policy gquestions, however, there was virteal unanimity.
Since these agreed-on conclusions represent the combined experience of the majority
of the directore of university computing centers in this couatry, they are set down here,
in he hope that they will be usedul to other directors, and also to univer eity and
governmental authorities who are involved in creating new and supporting existing
computing centers. The following two pa;fagraphs summarize the concensus in general
terms; details are given in Appendices I to H.

High speed computing equipment has already become & necesesary part of the
educational and research facilities of meost U. 5. aniversities and as such should be
supported by the university oa the same baglie as other equivalent equipment, General
knowledge of the use of computers is even 0OwW expected of student in many fields ef
science and engineering; Within the next ten years these machines will become a8
integral a part of the educational equipment of a scientific curriculum as is & chemistry
laboratory at present. Becaueve of ite potentialities in non-scientific fields {such as in

commerce and Hnguistics) as well 25 in scientific ones, & university computing ceanter should

be administered and financed as an institution-wide facility, in some respects analogous
