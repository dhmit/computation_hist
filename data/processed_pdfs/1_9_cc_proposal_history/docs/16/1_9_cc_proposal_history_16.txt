ONR Usage of the WW1l Computer Paty the 6«Month Period
July l; = December 31, 1955

In armodanss With our gst discussions with Mr. Fe G. Weyl, ONR,
I have prepared & 6-month summary of ONR usage of WWil. The abtached

; 4-pege table contains a brealdown of WW1 usage on the project basis.

During this 6-month interval, ONR's "free time" usage of WWl
breaks down es follows:

 

8. Machine Computation Committes 24,708.63
bo Solid State and Moleculer Theory (Slater) 29,092,74
Co Miscellansous projects al,2320)2

375, 083,49

The total machine usage during this &month period for this type of
work is 18,006.6 minutes, or approximately 300 hours.

think the information contained in the following table, such es
Tl title, programmer, M.I.T. Department, supsrvisor,
DIC contract number, ONR contract, minutes used, snd “free time" dollar

value, should give Mr, Weyl all the information he nesds for budget
discussions,

A consideration of the attached statistics reveals several items
which are worthy of mention. Specifically, some of the thesis research
is quite expensive as illustrated in the case of Jack Uretsky's |
problem 235 in which he has spent $13,925 during a G-month period. As |
a matter of fact, he has spent $18,132.70 on this problem since
November, 1954, Similarly, B. Campbell has spent $12,834. on problem 245 |
during this 6-month period, and $15,863.35 since November, 1954,

Likewise, Mr. K. Bryan has spent $1,870 during the pest six months and

a total of $19,841.60 since November, 1964. I think the G-month expenditure
of Slater's group == $29,092.74 is a fair indication of the efforts of ~

his group. Furthermore, his group has spent $47,944.25 since

. ape


"Qua

November, 1984 on this group of problems. There are other problems
which have been completed prior to June 30, 1954. All of this
indicates that we must exercise a tighter financial control on

some of these projects since there must be some maximum amount we
can properly spend on a thesis. I am looking forward to discussing
this matter with you at our next meeting.
