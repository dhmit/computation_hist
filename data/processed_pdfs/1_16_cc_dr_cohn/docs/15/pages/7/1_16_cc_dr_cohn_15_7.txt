A PERIODIC ALGORITHM FOR CUBIC FORMS
HarvEy CoHN

A lattice in three-dimensional space will be called reduced if its basis vectors
xf”, x5, 5" together with z{” = —z x5 ( J = 1,2, 3), lie one in each octant
of space or its negative octant. It may be seen that every lattice has a reduced
sublattice of universally bounded index (and the examination of a handful of
cases may even reveal this index to be unity). This type of algorithm is very
similar to one by Minkowski in which the basis vectors were three shortest
independent vectors under certain deformations, and two bases were called
neighbors if they had two basis vectors (out of three) in common, making three
neighbors in general. In the author’s algorithm the bases are “not far” from
Minkowski’s bases, and the process of finding neighbors involves agreement of
two (out of four) basis vectors. Here there are three to six neighbors in general,
making for more complicated patterns.

Similarly, reduced quaternary forms HZn,-xﬁ-” Gi=1,2,8,4;1=1,2.3)
can be defined. If this form is the norm in a totally real cubic module, it can
be shown there are only a finite number of reduced forms under change of basis;
and the neighbor concept will lead to finite (periodic) multi-dimensional struc-
tures. Finding the structures by this algorithm is very simple since it involves
only patterns of signs. For the integers in the cubic field for which D = 49, the
structure of the norm is 8 forms connected like the vertices of a cube. For D = 81
and D = 148, the structures have 16 and 28 forms respectively. Structures with
certain symmetries turn out to correspond to abelian fields, and the periodicity
of the structures, of course, leads to unities of the field.
