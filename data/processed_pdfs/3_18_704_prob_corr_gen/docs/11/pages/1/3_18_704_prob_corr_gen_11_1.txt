Dear Doctor Stratton:

A story in the New York Times last November 3 describes how your
704 computer now has a 60,000 word vocabulary., I would like to
explore this possible application with you:

We evaluate the reputations of companies, using a technique based
upon the investigation of all the words that can be used to describe
a corporation. (See enclosed booklet.) We are now in the process
of extending our evaluations to magazines and newspapers. Can your

704 computer save us the trouble of going through the dictionary
again?

To do so it would have to be able to sort out all the words that
can be used to describe a magazine.

In December I shall be in Boston and if this use of the 704 sounds

feasible, I would like to hear from you so I will know who to con-
tact there.

Yours very truly,

17
