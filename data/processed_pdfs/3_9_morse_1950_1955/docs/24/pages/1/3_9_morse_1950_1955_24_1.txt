Dear Professor Morse:

s Il am enclosing a copy of a letter which I sent
to Wright Field in connection with our contract. In ad-
dition, you will find a copy of the Quarterly Progress
Report for the period ending February 28, 1953,

There is also enclosed a copy of Report R-52,
which summarizes one of the major problems which we have
been doing on the Rockefeller Differential Analyzer =--
techniques for solving pursuit problems,

There are a number of technical reports in
various stages of completion, and I shall send you copies
of these when they are ready.

Sincerely yours,

F. M., Verzuh
