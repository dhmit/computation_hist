Reference: Contract N5or1-06001' DIC-#6345, #6915

items as the preparation of summary reports on the program of
Machine Methods of Computation,

This summary 1s based on estimstes prepared by Prof-
essor P. M. Morse.

Professor Morse further advises that the expected
arrival of an IBM Type 704 Electronic Data Processing Machine aÂ®
MIT about January 1, 1957 will create a definlte need for addl-
tional funds--to finance the converslon of existing Whlrlwind
programs to Type 704 programs. |

Under the proposed plan submitted herewlth, Project
#6345 (Whirlwind Operation) would terminate on June 30, 1957.
The task order Tor thies period would include the usual Whirlwind
project activities: |

1., Research in methods of numerical analyels and
the formulation of sclentific problema for machine
solution, together with the %training of personnel
in these methods.

2. Support of the Sclentiflc and Engineering Applica-=
tiong Group of Project Whirlwind so as to meke the
computer useful and available for the above-mentioned
research,

In addition, 1t is proposed that the following task
order arlging in connection with the Type 704 EDPM be included:

3, The development of a sguitable lnterpretive program
and sgsociated coding techniques to permit effectlve
{mplementation of the Type 704 machine,

It is anticipated that a separate procject will be set
up to handle the Type 704 utilization within the MIT Computation
Center, and a separate request to the ONR for support of this work
wlll be made in thse near future, In this respect certaln
experienced programmers could be made avallable for transfer to
this new task as of Januery 1, 1957. Thig entlcipated transfer
has been taken into sccount in the budget proposed for Project #6345,

The foregolng proposal does not take into congideration
termination costs which may be associated with the close out of
this contract and the possible disposition of the Whirlwind Computer.
It is proposed to delay the submittal of any budget for this matter
until such %ime as disposition of the Whirlwind Computer ls
determined,
