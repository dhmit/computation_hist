TOPIC: SYMBOLIC WORK ON HIGH SPEED DIGITAL COMPUTERS

    

 
 

ohn G. Kemeny, |
Mathematics Dep


STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM

High speed computers have augmented man's ability to
handle numerical data ang to get numerical solutions
However,

 

to problems,
the ability to handle symbols and formulas and to get
symbolic solutions to problems is even more fundamental to sci-
entific research,

 

 

 

Relatively little work has been done to study
the possible uses of high speed computers for such symbolic work.

We are convinced that the present computers have suf-
ficiently complex logic and are sufficiently adaptable that they
will be efficient in symbolic work, even though they have not
been designed for this purpose. We propose

l. to explore the general problem of how a digital
computer can be used for symbolic work,

2. to develop a machine language in which symbolic
work can be easily carried out,

3. to write a detailed "flow-diagram! adaptable to
any high speed machine for the carrying out of
one Important class of problems,

Lb. to write a program according to this "flow—-diagram!’
for the IBM 704 and possibly |

5. to make some recommendations for new designs in

computing machines that would adapt them better
for symbolic work.

For the specific problem to be tackled we propose the

finding of analytic solutions to a wide class of ordinary dif-

ferential equations. This is a sufficiently broad problem so

that one would have to face and solve all the basic issues that

would confront us in doing symbolic work on the high speed

com-
puters. On the other hand, we are convinced that this problem

1s not so great that we should be unable to show a possible re-
sult in a year and a half. With reasonable luck we should have
both the flow-diagram and at least a first version of the code
completed.

This code would of course have some immediate practical
use, but much more important would be the lessons we can learn on
how practical the high speed computers are for solving symbolic
problems and what is the best way of utilizing them. We propose
to write a specific code for the IBM 704. because we have ample
time available to us on such a machine, However, the theoretical
conclusions, as well as the flow-diagram, would be of use on any
high speed computer, and even the adaptation of the specific code
should take much less time than its original writing. Hence, we
believe that a very wide class of computers would profit from the
results of this work. Last but not least, we hope that this work

will suggest some improvements in computing machine design.


PERSONNEL

The proposed personnel for the project consists of
seven members of the Dartmouth College Mathematics Department.
The principal investigator would be John G. Kemeny, Professor
of Mathematics and Chairman of the Mathematics Department. In
addition there would be G. L. Thompson, J. McCarthy, and R. Z.
Norman, Assistant Professors of Mathematics, and R. E. William-
son, T. E. Kurtz, and J. B. Fraleigh, Instructors of Mathematics.
Biographies and bibliographies are appended.

TIMING

It is proposed that the project should start on Feb-
ruary 1, 1958, and run through June 30, 1959. This would in-
clude three academic semesters and one summer,

The principal investigator and five of the staff mem-
bers would expect to devote somewhere between 1/4 and 1/3 of
their time to this project. This figure is an average over the
year and a half of the duration of the project. It 1s expected
that Professor McCarthy's contribution will have to be more

limited, due to other commitments of a related nature.

COST

The exact cost of the project 1s somewhat hard to es-
timate, due to the fact that salary increases are to go into
effect this coming year at Dartmouth College. The size and ex-—
tent of these increases has not as yet been announced. However,
a fairly careful estimate would indicate that the actual cost of
the project (including both direct and indirect expenses) would
be in the neighborhood of $30,000.
