Dear Tolta:
I would like to report that the people at the Bducational Television and Radio

Carter are very much interested in contracting with WOBH-TV and MIT for the
production of the proposed ssrisz on computers. In fact, I believe I am quite

pale in saying that we need merely submit a definite proposal; with the budget,
in order to get this contract. This would give MIT exposure, via the kinessope

recordings, on the 2L existing ETV stations as well as the 8 others that ave
scheduled to be in operation by the emd of 1967.

i de not know how I can peselbly pat forward as strougly as I would like to our

feeling that this series should be deme. I am certain that you agree with us

in car thinking about the gresai importance of computers in our present society.

"he confusion that exists in peoplefs minds about the natures and function of

compaters 1s a result of poor and mieleading information and lack of information.

Fe feel here that it is our responsibility to try to do something aboat this.

We know that the people from MIT can do a series that will inform the public
in an organized, definitive manner shout computers. We agree that bafors we
can sctdslly treat thoraughly the function and significance of these devices,
as they relate to society in general; the public met have basic vu

&s to how the compubers work. My hope is thet the people at HIT will fesl
thelr responsibility for inforwing the public abeut this ares of ssientiflic
endeavor as mich as we do,

To get dom to cases, I feel that we can make certain adjustments as to the
amount of time required from any ome individual from the MIT faculty end/or
hell. AY one point ws discussed having a principal person released fulletime
for 9 months for this series. I am not at all certain that this is ReCesSeaRTY
With the proper ressarch, writing and production tsam operative, the key indie
vicuial on the series showld be ebls %o do this job with considerably less time
then was previcasly discussed, T want to repeat that I think it vitel that
one individual be the principal person appsaring on the series, although he
might certainly have guests on individual programs. This individual sheald be
chosen as mach from the standpoint of personality (in terms of effective TV
presentation) as from the standpoint of his knowledge and ability im the fisld.
