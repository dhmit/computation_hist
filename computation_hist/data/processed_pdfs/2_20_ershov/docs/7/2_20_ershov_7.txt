Dear Mr, Ershov
I have received your first two parcels of books. Many thanks.
I have sent you two books =~ by McCracken and by Davis,

My next parcel will contain notes on an advanced Programming Symposium
held at Michigan, and back issues of the Association for Computing Machinery
Commmnications, I also am arranging to send you the IMM Journal of Research,

Mr. Yovits told me of his meeting with you in London, Thank you fer
the copy of your paper,

1 should like to issue you an invitation to visit Carnegle Institute of
Technology, and spend from two weeks to a month in residence here. During
that time you could give some lectures on advanced programming, and work
with us on the development of new programming s ystems - like Lhe Zurich
language, and the language for symbol manipulation.

I would arrange for people interested in our work to visit Cernegie
Tech as well as for you to visit a few other Center's.

During your vieit here you will be considered a member of the staff
with all of its privileges.

We hive a programmer on our staff who speaks Russian fluently - however,
I feel sure after two »>eks in my company you will speak English quite

well,

It is hoped that such an invitation will be reciprocated by your
group, You understand it is important that such a visit not be for two
short a period in order that some worth while results may be obtained, If
you are interested please tell me how I may formally invite you.

If this letter is sufficient please let me know of your decision.

Sincerely yovurs
