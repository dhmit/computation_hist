Dear Phil:

Communications are slower than usual at the moment
because I am spending several weeks in Boulder, Colorado.

The draft of the report on the Chicago meeting seems
good on the whole. However, we did not receive a copy of
the appendices, and so cannot say anything about them.
There is one section in the report, starting with the last
sentence on page 5, which I believe to be inaccurate. I
suspect that some universities which put overhead money
into a computing center nevertheless make direct charges
for computing time devoted to sponsored research. 1 know
definitely that most (if not all) universities which re-
ceive NSF grants for support of computing centers make
such charges.

The provisions for distribution of the report are
certainly adequate. I doubt that we will have need for
anything like 100 copies.

Sincerely yours,
