vo] Dear Jacks

“On april 23 you wrote me  cgiitiot a sons : cliatah in
the space allotted to IBM in Puilding 20 and in the Compu~
tation Center. I have discussed the questions which you
raised with Professor Morse and Mr, MacKinnon. Our con-

clusion is that we cannot provide classroom space as oute
lined in your second choice, because of severs crowding

En 3 during certain periods in the regular acedemic year. There-

fore, you should plan to continue to use the Space assigned

35, Jou in Building 20C,

~~" Professor Morse Yas also aaroil. that you could use
Room 24-145 in the Computation Center and make the shifts
in your present Space that you outlined,

Very sincerely yours:
