Dear Dr. Morse,

e I do not remember whether you met my wife at
the meeting-at Ax; you probably did at the receiption.
You will be sorry to know that she died on 17th August,
after a very distressing disease which we all hoped might
be beaten, even up to the end.

Because of the very great shock, I have been
advised to make a very grezt change for at least .a short
time, and am therefore flying to Monireal on 9ti. veptember
for three weeks,~be£ore—returning’tv*take"up“my*appotntmnnt
with the University of Hull.

During my period in Cenada, I would wverymmuch
like to make a short visit to your part of the world and 1if
you are available, to see you. T would particularly like to
discuss educationazl matters, more especially as I have been
asked to organise a one year post graduate course in Operational
Research- for the University of Hull, have done all the
preliminary organising and start 1in earnest in October.

 

My address in Canada will be :

cfe A.F. Hanly,
615 Carleton Avenue, West Mount. Montreal.

Yeurs sincerely,

N .S wan
