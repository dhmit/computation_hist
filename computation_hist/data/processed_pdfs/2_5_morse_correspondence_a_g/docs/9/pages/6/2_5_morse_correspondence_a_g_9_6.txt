:1 In an alternative arrangement of beads of thef
kind described are formed as a set of heads 0
different dimensions, the connecting heads'may
be arranged to fit only into correspondingly
sized sockets and special junction beads maybe
provided with heads and sockets of noncor-
responding sizes. By this arrangementagraded
necklace may be built up with a number of sets
of beads, possibly of graded sizes, havtng the
same size heads and sockets and with the vari-
ous sets of beads joined by the special junction
heads.

7 According to a further feature of the present
invention each bead may be formed of a number
of parts which are joined together, for example,
by being made in the form of two halves of a
hemisphere which are subsequently joined. This
construction has the advantage that it enables
hollow beads to be made, which is particularly
advantageous for larger size beads since it
saves material and enables a light-weight bead
to be made. This form of construction further-
more provides one means of making multi-
coloured beads since the various parts of the

bead may he made of different coloured ma-
terials.

8 The two halves of a bead formed as two hol-
low hemispheres may be made to join together
With a snap action, for example by forming one
hemisphere with a portion, around the mouth
of reduced external diameter so as to fit in»
side the mouth of the other hemisphere. The two
engaging hemispheres may be resiliently locked
by forming a number of recesses or a circum-
ferential groove on one of the mating surfaces
and corresponding projections or a circum
ferential ridge on the other. -

beads is by using a double moEldinlglpl'o‘cfs’s-‘reld

11 The method of joining beads or similar bOdie
described above is applicable [0 pendant or“:
ments such as earrings. For some such Orna-
ments it may be desirable to provide head;
with more than one socket whereby two 0, more
pendant beads or like bodies may be attached to
one bead.
12 For use in a string of beads, it may be con.
venient to mould a plurality of beads together as
a unit, the beads being joined by aflexible neck.
Such a unit would be provided with a neck and
head at one end and a socket at the other end so
that a series of such units can be joined together
or joined to individual beads to form a necklace
or the like.
13A particular feature of the construction of
beads described above is that it permits ofcon-
siderable ﬂexibility in the junction between the
beads. This ﬂexibility may be obtained either
by flexibility of the neck or by the freedom of
play of the neck in the socket of the next bead.
Preferably the socket is formed with a conical
or similar opening to permit angular movement
of adjacent beads without the necessity of flex-
ing the neck. It may be found desirable in some
cases to taper the neck in order to permit greater
freedom of movement. Such taper need not
necessarily be a straight taper. it will be ap-
preciated also that the use of along neck will
increase the ﬂexibility of a necklace formed
from such beads.
14 It will be understood that modifications of the
above construction are possible without depart-
ing from the scope of the invention. For example,
instead of having a socket on one side and stem
on the other, each head may be formed with two
sockets, the beads being connected together'by
means of separate double-headed stems or llnk
Pieces. Furthermore, the inventionhas SPPII‘?‘

22Figure 8 is a cross—section of a modified
form of the bead of Figures 1 and.,2.
mReferring to Figures 1 to 3, there is shown a
construction of bead necklace in which each
bead is formed as asolid substantially spherical
body 10 having projecting radially therefrom a
short and comparatively thin neck 11 carryinga
substantially spherical head 12. Diametrically
opposite the head 12 is a socket 13 which is en-
tered by way of a mouth 14 of slightly smaller
diameter than the head 12 of another bead which
is to be received in the socket. The mouth is
slightly below the surface of the main part of
the body 10 and is entered by way of a tapered
entry passage 15. These beads are made by
moulding resilient plastic material, such as
polyethylene. The resilience of the material
permits of the head 12 on one bead being forced
through the mouth 14 into the socket 13 of
another head. The socket is made amply large
enough to accommodate the head 12. The head
can thus move in the socket. Since also there
is provided the tapered entry passage 15, the
construction allows angular movement between
the beads so as to provide the requisite ﬂexibili—
ty of a string of such beads. It will be seen that
the beads can be strung together without the
need of any conventional thread or cord and
that, moreover, the conventional clasp for
fastening a necklace can also be dispensed with
if desired. A necklace may be made up of a
number of identical beads but, as shown in Figure
3, the beads may be graded in size. Preferably
all the heads and sockets are made of the same
size but in a graded necklace it may be neces-
sary on the smaller beads to have smaller heads
and sockets. In such a case, the connecting
heads and sockets may be graded in size so that
each head will fit into a socket on the same size
bead and into a socket of the nextlarger or .next
smaller size. Alternatively, the connecting

heads may be aranged only to fit into corre—
spondingly sized sockets and special junction
beads provided with heads and sockets of non-
corresponding sizes. .

24The heads may be made spherical asdescribed
above or may be conico-spherical in shape, that

is to say, the head is formed of a hemisphere
which at its diametral plane is joined to a cir-
cular cone, the conical part of the head being
arranged with its apex directedoutwardly facili-
tating the assembly of the beads. In this latter
case, the socket mouth may conveniently be
made circular with a diameter less than that of
the major axis of the head.

25 Figure 4 illustrates an alternative construc—
tion in which each head 20 is provided with two
sockets 21, 22. The beads are joined by con-
necting links each formed by a stem 23 having
heads 24, 25 at the two ends thereof. It will be
readily apparent that it would also bepossible to
use the beads 20 with beads having two heads
projecting from diametrically-opposite points.
asFor large beads it may be preferable to con-
struct the bead as a hollow member in order to
save material and enable the head to be of lighter
weight. Such a hollow bead may be constructed
as shown in Figure Sin which the bead is formed
of two separate moulded parts 31, 32 each of sub—
stantially hemispherical form. The part 32 is
shown as having an inwardly-directed ﬂange 33
which engages a recess 34 formed on the part
31. The resilience of the material permits the
two halves to be joined together with a snap
action. It will be appreciated that the ﬂange 33
may not extend completely around the mouth of
the hemisphere and might consist only ofanum-
ber of projecting lugs which engage correspond-
ing recesses in the part 31. The parts 31 and
32 are formed one with a head 35 and the other
with a socket 36 for connection to similar beads
as in the previously described embodiments.
For convenience of moulding, in the two—part
bead of Figure 5, the socket is formed by a
short passage which tapers inwardly from both
ends to have a throat through which a bead is
forced to pass into the hollow interior of the
bead. It will be appreciated that hollow beads
similar to Figure 5 might be made of more than
two parts and also that the various parts may be
made of different colours to form multi-coloured
beads.

27 As shown in Figure 6, a bead 40 may be pro-
vided with a plurality of heads and/or sockets,
for example two sockets 41, 42 and ahead 43 so
that it may be joined to threeother bodies. Such
a bead will permit of a pendant ornament being
fixed on to a necklace or the like. It will, of
course, be appreciated that the heads and/or
sockets may be formed in any selected positions,
ea As shown in Figure 7, a number of beads 44
may be formed as an integral unit joined by
necks 45. Such an arrangement may facilitate
the construction and assembly of a necklace by
reducing the number of units required to be
joined together. Each group of beads may be
