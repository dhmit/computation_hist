Dr. A. Whitney Griswold, President
Yale University
New Haven, Connecticut

Dear Dr. Griswold:

It is with a great deal of pleasure that I enclose’ our check
for $2, 300. 00 representing the first semester portion of the stipends
for the IBM Research Associates and Assistants recently appointed
for the 1959-60 school year in connection with the M.I.T. Computation

Center. A detailed description of the appointments is attached.

The increasing use of the IBM 704 Computer at M.1.T. by
the New England colleges both as an educational device and a research
tool has been very encouraging to IBM, and we are delighted that Yale
is having an active part in it as represented by these research
appointments.

Sincerely yours, :

hia Su ier
