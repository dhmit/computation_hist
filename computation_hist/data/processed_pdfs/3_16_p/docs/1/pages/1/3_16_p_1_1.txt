M.I.T. COMPUTATION CENTER

To: Dean Francis Bitter Date: June 26, 1959
From: Professor Philip M. Morse

Subjeect: President's Report

The Computation Center has completed 1ts second year
of activity using the IBM 704 computer donated and maintained by
the International Business Machlnes Corporation. During the year
some 600 problems were active on the machine. These problems were
representative of many filelds of research such as physies, linquistics,
and engineering. The problems were programmed and coded by
graduate students and staff from M.I.T. and from the twenty-eight
cooperating colleges and universities in New England.

 

Usage of The machine has grown to the extent that nearly
all of the available time on the computer is being used. Because
of this and because of intrinsic interest in machine utilization;
several procedures have been developed by the Center staff to male
the operation of the machine more efficient. Primarily these
steps have consisted of organizing computer operations so that most
frequently used programs are read from magnetic tape as well as
eliminating manual intervention for non-critical thinking. Hence
time wasted is wminimized in running any given problem. Other
improvements have been the development of various utility programs
which have facilitated the usage of the Fortran II programming
system. The Fortran system, which is used to prepare about one-half
of the problems for the machine, has definitely made it easier for
problems to be prepared for the machines.
