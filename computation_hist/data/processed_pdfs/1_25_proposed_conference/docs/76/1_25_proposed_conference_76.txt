Dear Walter:

I got a telephone response from Grad concerning
the letter I sent to him. He says that they are very much
interested in getting a proposal from us for such a cone
ference and the sooner the better. He thinks he will see
you at a Math Soclety meeting or at the AMC meeting here in
September, and hopes to talk to you about the form of the
proposal. I will be back in this country by the twelfth of
September and will get in touch with you shortly thereafter.

I would hope we could get a proposal off to NSF
soon after that.

Yours,
Philip M. Morse
