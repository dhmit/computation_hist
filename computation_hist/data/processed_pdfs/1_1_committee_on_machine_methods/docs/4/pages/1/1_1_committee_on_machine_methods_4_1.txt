Kopsl listed the courses given in the Electrical Engineering
De ertnent in this general subject. There are four courses, 6. 531
«- 2.531;, inclusive, which Kopsl gives. these cover mainly the
fundamentals of Numerical Analysis with a certain amount of
laboratory work to develop facility in the use of desk machines.
Kopel feels that these courses represent a bare minimum of train-
ing .to get a person started in the field, and that it would be

desirable to have further more—advanced courses if we wish to ex-

pend our graduate training in this field.

‘ Another four courses given in the Electrical Engineer
Department are: 6.535, given by Welchmen, on coding for dis tel
machines; 6.536, given by Caldwell, on analogue machines; 6.53M,
given by Verzuh, onthe design of machine components; and 6.56,
given by Guillemin, on mathematical circuit theory, which con-
tains some aspects of the design of machine components. In addi-
tion, there is course H54, ustbemeticel Laboratory, given in the
mathematics Department, which is quite unconnected with these
other courses. The general feeling of the Committee was that
considerable discussion "will be required to decide wimt further
courses should be suggested, but that eventually further strength
would be needed in a moreoadvenced course, or courses.

Professor Brown arrived at tnis time, and the discussion
turned to the questions of the graduate students considered last
time. He reports that Professor Thomas is in charge of prepara-
tion of the written examination for the Electrical Engineering
Department for February. Professor Brown will suggest to Pro-
fessor Thomas that he get in touch with Feshbac’n, Lin, Morse,
and heissner with regard to collection of questions for the
special examination in February for Booton and Carrus. £0 a].

w ll talk to Booton and Caz-rue to let them Know the genera sub.
Ject matter of the special examination. Professor Brown will
discuss the other cases mentioned in the minutes of the last
meeting with the graduate committee of we Electrical Engineering
Department this Thursday and will report back on the other ques-
tions mentioned in the last minutes.
