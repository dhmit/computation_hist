We first perform an integral unimodular

for some integer In and some choice of :l: sign, We immediately see that only the

minus sign can occur: For we write out the lower left—hand elements of the
matrix equation

6. Change of generators

To gain more information about the representation of 9, we select the simplest
possible generators. It is more (convenient at times to use a triple of generators,
