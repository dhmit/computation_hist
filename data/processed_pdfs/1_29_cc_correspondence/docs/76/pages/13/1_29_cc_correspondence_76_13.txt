to initiate the next job. If no arguments are

given, all of core storage is dumped in octal—

this feature should not be used normally. The

last format indication may be omitted, in which

case it will be assumed to be octal.

Example:

22

Consider the FORTRAN Source Program

DIMENSION A(100), C€(100), B(100), N(100)
COMMON B
DO 22 I=1, 100

A(I)
B(I)
N(I)
C(I)
CALL

DUMP (?)

To dump the array A in floating point,
the CALL DUMP statement would be

CALL DUMP (A,A(100),1)
To dump both the A and N arrays,
CALL DUMP (A,A(100),1,N,N(100),0)

To dump in octal with mnemonics from
absolute location 10010 to the array N
but not including the array N, another

statement is required:

I, = XLOCF(N) - 100
CALL DUMP (N(L),N(101),3)

The use of this procedure, since it in-

volves an absolute location, is not
