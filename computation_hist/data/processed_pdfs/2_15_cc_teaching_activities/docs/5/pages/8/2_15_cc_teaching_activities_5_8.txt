Calculation of Nuclear Transformations -and Radioactive Decay

_ A MITILAC program was prepared whick computes the anumber
of atoms present in the nth chain member in the simultaneous
transformation by nuclear reaction in radioactive decay of 2
given target nuclide in a2 given neutron flux at any time.

Computation of Interest Calculations for Saviﬁgs Banks.

A basie 650 ‘program was proparad which automatically
handleg any . any of the six different methods for performing interest
calculations arising in the savings bank.

Computation of Bivariate f‘requency Distributions on the 850

A basic 650 program was prepared which computes the
bivariate freguency digtribution by corresponding class intervals
(for various parameters), and aleso computes certain statistics
obtained from the above-mentiomed distribution. An effective

method of storage allocation is employed which employs 2 neat

trick for obtaining the desired argunants and functions in an
internally-stored table of values.

Study of thinun.Progralninz on the 650 Calcnlator

A besic 650 program was prepared which studied various
methods for effecting semi~optinum data storage on the drum.
A compact decimal system for word storage and selectiom using

the ten branch imstructions (BRD 3 ~ 10, respectively).

Solvent Extraction of Hetals -

A basic 650 program was prepared for computing the
distribution coefficients of zircon and hafnium in the agueous
and organic phases.

Solution of the Heat Flow Equation

A basic 650 progrem was prepared for the solution of a
partial differential equation describing the heat flow problea

using several different boundary conditions.

Itorative Method for Solving Simultaneous Equations on the G650
A basic 650 program was prepared whick evaluates the

convergence rate, accuracy, and seolution time using Craig's

method, Conjugate Gradient method, and Lanczos's method,
rogpectively.

650 Solution of the Vertical Registivity Problem

A MITSS program was prepared for the solution of the integral
equation arising in geophysical prospecting.
