- Dean Harrison snd F. Verzuh, the disposition of the capital gooads, machines,
stock and materiais, etc. aveilable in the RDA machine shop was considered.
It was decided that the RDA shop eguipment was to be transferred to Room 10-481
‘ , vhere it will be reactivated as a shop to be used in connection with the com-
putationsl gctivities which have been recently transferred to Building 10.
