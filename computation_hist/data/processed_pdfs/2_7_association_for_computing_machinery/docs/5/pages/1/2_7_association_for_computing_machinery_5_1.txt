Dear Professor Douglas:

If it is still possible, I would like to deliver a
paper at the annual meeting of the Association for Computing
Machinery in Urbana, Illinois on June 11, 1958. The paper I
would like to deliver is entitled: "Generation of Spherical ,
Bessel Functions 1n Digital Computers," by Fernando J. Corbato
and Jack L. Uretsky.

I enclose the requested four copies of the title page,

form.
