i informed Ur, E. Po Little dering the early part
of the summer that the activity on this contract woulé not
pe initiated in full volume on June 1, 1852 because of the
personnel procurene nt problems This, in pert, explains the
delay in the submission of this first guarterly repofi.
The other reason 18 gimply that there are over 300 pages

ip the report and ils preparation was an exceedingly time=
consuming task, At sny rate, One reproducible (a transparasnt

1] wish te emphasize that only a portion af the work
represented hy this report was performed assing funds of this
contract. ¢pecificelly, this thesis represents several years'
work, and it is only the final siages of it which were performed

during this quarterly period.

Attached you will find an abstract of this thesis
reperi which will give you an idea of its content. I hope
this will be helpful to you,

in conclusion, I wish to stale that the succeeding
progress reports will not be as tardy as this one. Specifie-
cally, (uarterly Report Feo, 2 is toc de submitted to the
printer on December 1st, and you should receive it as soon
as the succesding publication technicalities will permit.

Very truly vours,

This report is primarily concerned with the solution
of uoundary-value preblems by means of autcometic computing
equipment {both enalogue and digital), Specifically, in
oddition to the familiar desk calculator, the felloewing
digital computers were used in this studyd the type 602A
Electromechanicael Calculator, the type 604 Electronic
Calculator, the Card Frogrammed Tslculater, and the M,I.T,
ihirlwind Computer. The anfilogue studies were obhlained by
uga of the M,1.T. Rockefeller Differential Analyzer.

This study is primarily concerned with the scolution
of ordinary differentisl equations in which certain boundary
conditions are specified at two or more values of the
Independent variable, Such problems are generally called
boundary-value problems, it is clearly evident that the
solution of such problems is inherently more difficult than
the solution of initialevalue problems in which 211 conde
tions are specified at one point, The particulsr problems
studied are further complicated by the fact that their
solutions are required over an infinite range which cone
tains regions of nen-gnajyticity.

A computational philosophy is presented which empha-
sizes thal a machine must Le evaluated on & firm engineering
and economic basigse~-a basis which must include the entire
computetional procedure, An evaluation is given of the.
relative advantages and limitations of the five computers
used In this study. A fair svaluvation must include the

time for: problem preparation, numerical analysis,
programming, coding, machine setup, machine solution,
checking, and so forth. The accuracy and cest of 8 particu
lar sciution must also ve Included,

This report else illustrates the manner in which the
techniques for solving simultanecus linear slgebralc zquaw
tions are apnrlied te the soluticn of the boundary value
problem, A detalled description of the entire computa

tional procedure characteristic to each cesputer fs aiven
in &n associated Appendix,
