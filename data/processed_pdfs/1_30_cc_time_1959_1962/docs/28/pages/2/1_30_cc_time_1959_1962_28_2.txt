The figures on pages 7 and 8 are a graphical representation of the .jlnromtion
reported in Tables I, II and III on MIT's total use for the 15 week period. An
additional breakdown by number of problems is represented in these charts.

INSTALIATION OF THE 709

The installation of the 709 was begun July S5th and the computer was made
available, on &8 part-time schedule, on September 6th. The first four or five
weeks of this installation period were spent in renovating the computer room
iteelf. The air-conditioning duct work layout needed extemsive modification, new
electrical service was installed and the steel plates which make up the false floor
had to be removed, reworked and replaced. Finally, after installation of the new
computer, the air-fiow im the room had to be re-balanced. The difficulties, expense
and delay occasioned by these modifications point out the advantages of recent
innovations in the design of computer installations; it is intended to use some of
these new techniques in the 7020 imstallation in January, 1962,

SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS

The first week the computer was available, it was used for testing of the
programming systems that would be used and the laboratory sessions of the
Computation Center's September Programming Course. For convenience, the period
September 15 through December 31, 1960 was taken as a single operating quarter.
During this time, 271 problems used 576 hours of computer time. Another 98
problems which had been authorized to use the computer made no use of it. The
use of 709 time was very light during the early weeks of this period primarily
because of the need to convert existing 704 programs to the 709. In the later
part of the periocd, the demand had increased so that serious thought was being
given to a six~-day operating week.
