was apleted in order to cause immediate ezZecucion of the assemblec program,

olic program is to be assembled with reference to 2 sSyabol
table punched during a previous a
vious assembly between MI GET SAP and UA SAP 150,
If the on-line punching of the symbol table is to be suppressed, place
UA £AF S5T between MI GRT SAP and UA SAP 150,

jeto

if the symbolic deck is to be read on-line during the second pass as
well as during the first pass, it must be Placed immediately folliowing UA
SAP 258, (or amy card which replaces UA SAP 258, UA SAP 2 NQ for example). The
symbolic deck must still be read between UA SAP 150 and UA SAP 258,

At the end of an assembly, the assembler executes a locad card sequence.
Thus if a number of assemblies are to be done with the same semse switch settings,
time may be saved by Puttiing the calling decks together in the proper sequence

and loading them into the on-lime reader as g single deck.

Putcigghﬁngolic DEcks on Tape with the Off£-Line Reader:

/A SHARE 80-84 reader board should be used,

The only end-of~file mark should be at the end of the last symbolic
deck loaded on the input tape.

%ach symbolic deck should be carefully checked to make sure the lagt
card is an END card,.
