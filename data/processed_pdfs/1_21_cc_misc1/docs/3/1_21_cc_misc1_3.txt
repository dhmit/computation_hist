Dear Professor Battles:

The Computation Center at M.I.T., by arrangement with
the International Business Machines Corporation, provides a
certain amount of computing service to accredited colleges and
universities in New England. To avoid overloading our facilities,
it is agreed that the service is extended only to accredited
institutions granting at least the bachelor's degree. I believe
the Hartford Seminary Foundation does not come under this
category.

Trinity College is a participating institution, how-
ever, and it might be worth your while discussing with our
Institutional Representative there, Professor C. R, Miller, the
possibility that Trinity would be willing to sponsor your work.

Sincerely yours,

Philip M. Morse
Director
