Dear Dr. Webbers 2 PR EERR

 

We regret to inform you that the National Science
Foundation is unable to support the proposal for "Computing
Research", under the direction of Dr. Philip MH. Morse.

‘ In evaluating each proposal submitted to the Founda-
tion, a number of factors are considered. They include the
following: the scientific merit of the proposal and its merit
in relation to other proposals received by the Foundation in the
sane general field of science; the relation of the proposal to
contemporary research in the field; the distribution among fields
of science within the program of the Foundation; the geographical
distribution of research support by the Foundation; and, finally,
the funds available for research support. Thus, many excellent
proposals cannot be supported for reasons aside from intrinsic
merit, although this is an important consideration.

Lven though we are unable to support this proposal, we
would be pleased to consider other research proposals which you
night wish to submit.

Sincerely yours,

Alan T. Yateyman
Director
