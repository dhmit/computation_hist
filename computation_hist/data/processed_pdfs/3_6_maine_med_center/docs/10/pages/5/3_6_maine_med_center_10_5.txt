torized version of a twenty-channel electronic multiplexer reported by the Naval
Ordnance Laboratory (6).

Each diode gate and its associated counter stage are ;ssembled on a
L" x 6" plug-in printed circuit board. The interstage circuit of the counter is
also mounted on this board. 20 such identical boards plus L additional boards for
the trigger circuits comprise the entire commutator exclusive of the power supply.
Power requirements are #50V and =50V at 1C ma each and +1CV and -20V at 100 ma
sachs The ring counter is made up of 20 binary stages using 2NL39NPN transistors.
These individual stages are coupled together by diode-capacitor interstages to
close the ring. Although no clamping circuits were used in the individual binary
stages, the rise and fall time of the collector pulses were less than 2 microseconds.
Diode clamping was added to the switching stace itself to improve the stepping action
of the ring. The input impedance that is seen by the signal source when the gate is
open is the back resistance of two diodes in parallel. Silicon junction diodes are
used to keep this impedance high. Tests made on the diode gates indicate a trans=-
mission gain of 0,996 for the open gate with a linearity of 0.5% from 10 millivolts
to 5 volts for both positive and negative signals, With the gate closed, input

signals were attenuated more than 60 db,
