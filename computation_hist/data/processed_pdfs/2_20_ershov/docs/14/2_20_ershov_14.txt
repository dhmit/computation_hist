Dear Professor Morse, re ay
T heard from Perlis regarding Ershov 's follows:

"rhe invitation to Ershov is being nego-
tiated by ONR and the Academy of Sciences. 1
will let you know as soon as I hear from them.
500.00 is plenty. As soon as an acceptable
itinary for Ershov is arranged a simple letter
to him should be made by me."

Sincerely yours,
