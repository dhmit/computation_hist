Dear Dr. Morse,

As you know, an informal meeting of University Computing
Center directors was held Wednesday night at the IBM Homestead.
It was the consensus of opinion of the group that an annual meeting
of university computing center representatives should be held just
before or after the annual ACM meeting. No formal organization
was proposed but it was suggested that a program committee be
formed to arrange the program for the next meeting.

In view of your expressed interest and the fact that the next
ACM meeting is to be held at MIT, the group felt that you would be
the most appropriate person to head this committee. The three of
us have been authorized to extend this invitation to you and at the
same time serve on the committee to assist you.

We sincerely hope that you will accept this responsibility
and we all look forward to working with you.

Sincerely yours,

Solon PY Sse dlese
