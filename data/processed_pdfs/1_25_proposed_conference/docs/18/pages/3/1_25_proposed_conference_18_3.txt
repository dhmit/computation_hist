In discussing these questions it is necessary to investigate whether certain
combinations of these policies can exist in steady state together. For example-

a charge policy of the form: ''those who can pay get first priority and those who

cannot get second priority'' cannot exist in steady state with a facility which is bedgeted
to break even==(example). In general economic laws will cause cheaper services to
drive more expensive ones out of circulation, and Gresham's law will similarly

favor lower standards against high quality.
