I'mages i a circular boundary.—1Iy order to
test the effect of a finite cireular boundary oy
the field .distribution, the dipole field rwas
mea.sured m a conventional single-layer tank
having fhe same diameter as the double-layer
tank. The “tank constant”, A, was again
made equal to 1.0. The results are shown in
figure 6. The finite boundary not only distorts
the field, but also increases the magnitude of
the potential values. Near the center of the
tank, the boundary effect is small, but the
effect becomes large in the vicinity of the
boundary. In ele('t1‘0('ardiography, potentials
are measured on the outer boundary, so that
1ts influence becomes of paramount impor-
tance.
| As the boundary in the single-layer tank is
Insulating, the equipotentials meet it orthog-
onally everywhere, The reason for this is that
the lines of current flow must be tangential to
the boundary in its immediate vicinity, and the
equipotentials are always orthogonal to the
current flow lines. A comparison betweel
.ﬁgl“'(‘b' 3 and 6 gives graphic evidence of the
Improvement brought about by the double-
layer tank.

The image system for a circular insulating

imﬂ’ge system shows that the zero potential

verse axis, and explains why points oi. max-

oral lie along the dipole axis.

In figure 6, the source and sink are located

If the boundary were not present, as in figure 3,
the potential at the same point would be

If the source and sink shown in figure 7 are
close together, they may be treated as a dipole,
al.ld an image dipole found outside the circle.

By letting the dipole in figure 8 take on
various positions and angles, and observing the
movements of the image dipole, one can
visualize the resulting potential and current
distribution inside the circle. The real and the
image dipoles can be assumed to be in free
space, and the field due to each can be super-
posed to find the resulting field.
