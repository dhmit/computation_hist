In accordance with our discussions regarding the proposal to list,
I am enclosing the following information.

Inchine lemt 93 the 3.1.1:. mutation Center

The ILLT. Computation Center will have a Type 704 Electronic

Data Processing llachine with the following machine complement:

12 magnetic tape units, 2 magnetic cons storage units containing a

total of 3,000 words, 1 magnetic drum unit containing 4,000 words

of storage, the usual gn-line punched card reader, alphabetic printer,

and punched card recorder as well as the 3 gig-line magnetic tape

controlled printer, magnetic tape controlled card punch, and punched

card—to-magnetic tape converter, respectively. Total machine

complement net monthly- rental is slightly over $45,000. In addition

to the 704, there will be 1_o auxiliary punched card machines including
. card punches, collators, sorters, reproducers, interpreters, and the

Type 407 Accounting Machine. The aggregate machine rental is in
excess of $ 50,000 per month.

 

 

me Type 704 EDPII unit is one of the fastest large—scale
commercial computers available today. Since the ILLT. installation
will be but one of many in the field, techniques, programs, and
numerical procedures developed for this machine will be of universal use.

Biographical Information

Dr. F. I. Verzuh, Director of Statistical Services, has been
connected with the operation of MJJr. computational work since 1940.
In this capacity he has had considerable experience with the utilization
of various analog computing equipment —- differential analyzers, etc.,

as well as a complete line of digital machines ranging iron the Inn
Type 601 through the Type 704.

He received a 3.5. degree in Electrical Engineering Iron the
University of Denver in 1940, a 10.3. degree in Electrical Engineering

from M.I.’1‘. in 1946, and a Son. degree in Electrical Engineering from
ILLT. in 1952.
