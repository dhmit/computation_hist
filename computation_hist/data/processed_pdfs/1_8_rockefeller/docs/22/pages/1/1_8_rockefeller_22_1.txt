for three years to help support a research staff, so that the V ,
Computation Center at HIT can explore new ms whereby highaspeed
computing equipment can be utilized in social science. Directions
for initial researoh are mdicated, though details cannot be given
before work is started. A tentative budget and description of the
computing equipment are appended, together uith an outline of the
arrangements for other New England colleges to participate in use
or the equipment.

I have talked this application over with Dr. Carl F. Floe,
Assistant Chancellor of MIT. and it has his approval. Please let

Sincerely yours ,
