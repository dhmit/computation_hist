Dear Professor Morse :

In accordance with our conference on May 6th,
I am enclosing two copies of each of the following reports:

1. Quarterly Progress Report, 2-28-53

2. Report 5—10

3. Solution of Boundary Value Problems on
Automatic Computing Equipment

The above reports are those which you suggested
could be sent to C01. Haywood with your next letter re-
garding the new contract proposal.

 

By the way, in my rush the other day I forgot
to ask you whether McGraw-Hill has asked you to review my
book on Machine Computation. 1 took the liberty of giving
your name as a possible reviewer—-I hope you don't mind.
I h_0£ to have this book ready for publication next spring.

Sincerely yours,

g—{WL
