communication of each operator with the machine. A typical application
would be a group of operators receiving sales orders each tied TO the
computer and the machine jtself tied to the tpransactlion group .

Computer operation would presumably be assynchronous, but there would

memory units and possibility of unit® failures, the scop€ of operations,
the possibilities of the queries to the computer, and the question

of ‘a responding—type memory .
