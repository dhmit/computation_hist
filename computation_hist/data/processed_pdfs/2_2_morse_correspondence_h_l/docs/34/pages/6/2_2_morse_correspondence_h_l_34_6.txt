are aluminum and silver, nor is it as poor a conduc.tor

not been isolated.

been made with radiation incident on the metal film
as well as with radiation incident on the backing, and the
computations were timed separately for both cases.
The first estimates listed are those for film incidence;
the final values obtained for film incidence are always
used as first estimates for the calculation for backing
incidence.

Provisions have been made for two methods of
obtaining first estimates. When actual values are
available, either from previous publications or from
tables for solid metals, these can be inserted into
Whirlwind I, which then proceeds to make successive
approximations. When no such values are available,
Egs. (9) and (10) together with Egs. (13) and (14)
are used by Whirlwind I to obtain first estimates and
to make successive approximations automatically with-
out external interference. As has been pointed out,
Egs. (9) and (10) are not valid in the visible wavelength
region, but they provide adequate first estimates to
start a series of successive approximations leading to
values of the optical constants within experimental
precision. Many data have been evaluated on Whirl-
wind I, and the results for samples prepared here are
scheduled for future publication. Table VII is a sample,
for A=7000A, of results obtained by Whirlwind I, cor-
responding to reflectances and transmissions measured
by Krautkraemer.® The results of Krautkraemer’s own
calculations are also included. It is at once noted that,
while Krautkraemer reported one pair of constants per
sample per wavelength, there are four such pairs calcu-
lated by Whirlwind I for each sample and wavelength.

10 T, Krautkraemer, Ann. Physik 32, 537 (1938).

There are two reasons for this. In the first place Kraut-
kraemer either discarded the measurements made with
backing incidence or, in some instances, used an ap-
proximation utilizing both film and backing incidence.
This approximation is based on an assumption that the
optical constants are the same for film as for backing
incidence. The results produced by Whirlwind I were
calculated for film and backing incidence independently,
as shown in the lines marked “f”” and “‘d,” respectively.
From these results it can be seen that the constants
obtained from film incidence are not necessarily iden-
tical with those obtained from backing incidence. There
may be several reasons for this discrepancy. In the first
place the measurements themselves may be at fault,
particularly for the very thinnest films, which have
low reflectances. In the second place there may be a
difference in properties of the metal at the air and at
the backing surface of the film. Since the reflectance
depends more strongly on the condition of the film
nearest the surface of incidence, a difference between
the two surfaces would manifest itself in the constants
calculated from film and backing incidence. The second
reason for the multiplicity of the results produced by
Whirlwind T is that a complete double-valued solution
was obtained, as indicated by subscripts “1” and “2.”
When Krautkraemer’s results are compared with those
produced by Whirlwind I, it is seen that his results for
deposits thicker than 24A agree quite well with the
results having subscript “2,” for which ne< ke, and
that for the thinner deposits Krautkraemer’s results are
in agreement with the results with subscript “1” for
which 7:> k1. According to Krautkraemer’s results the
curve n vs thickness crosses the curve & vs thickness.
