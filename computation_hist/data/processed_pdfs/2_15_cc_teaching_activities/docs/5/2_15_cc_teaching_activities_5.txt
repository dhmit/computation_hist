ACADEMIC COMPUTATIONAL TRAINING PROGRAM

introduction

There are a number of graduate subjects in automatic computation,
numerical analysis, and now electronic data processing, offered at HM.I.T.
The present list of subjects directly related to machine computation includes
the following:

It is spparent from the above list that these subjecis are predominantly
Graduate A subjects -- which indicates that this subject is primarily for
graduate students. However, it is perfectly possible for undergraduate

students in their senior year to teke these subjects as an elective.

Machine-Aided Analysis - 6,25

Subject 6.25 ~-- Machine-Aided Analysis -- was offered for the Zirst
time during the fall term 1253-1954. This subject differs from other
computational subjects in the following respects:


1. It is a fourth-year elective subject designed for the
undergraduate,

2. It is a survey subject which covers numerical analysis,
analog computation, and digital computation,

3. It provides the student with a ganeral knowledge of some
of the numerical metheds necessary for machine computation.

Admittedly, such a survey subject camnot be all inclusive, and because of

the large enrollment, it is no longer possible io provide the student with
actual physical contact with any computer.

Since 1853 this subject has turned out to be increasingly popular.
As a matter of fact, it is now offered both fall and spring terms, Tho
attendance is quite high. There were 106 students in 6,25 during the
Fell Term 1958, and 47 students during the Spring Term 1956. This subject
offered at the undergraduaie level enables students to decide whether they
are interested in taking additional subjects in this area, and if they are,
there are 10 graduate subjects in which they may enroll.

Introduction to Digital Computer Coding and Logic - 6.535

This subject was, as usual, again offered during the Spring Term 1856,
and there were 97 students envolled. As a result, it wes necessary to divide
the subject into two sectiens taught by D. Arden and P. Helwig, respectively.

Because of the large enrollment in this subject, no attempt was made
tc make actual use of any computer, As a matter of fact, the usual detailed
coding for the Whirlwind Computer was not presented, and students were not
allowed to use the computer because of the large size of the group. Since the
departure of Professor Adams, the content of the course has been changed
somewhat, and during the spring term considerable emphasis has been devoted
to a study of the logical design of the internal system aspects of several
large computers ~- Whirlwind, NORC, IDl, etc,

Electronic Computational Laboratory ~ 6.5338

The subject matter offered in 6.538 since 1947 provided the student
with two basic types of material. Specifically, some 80% of the laboratory
work was devoted to 2 study of electronic circuit Sospoumnte by actual
laboratory work on the following ezperiments:

Detailed information rogazding the above nine experiments was given
to the students by means of a written set of notes (230 pages) which were
written as reference notes znd experiment notes, respectively. In sdditien to
‘the above nine experiments, twe laboratory experiments were devoted to the use
of punched card equipment. Specifically, one on the card punch, sorter, and
fabuletor, and the second on the Card Programmed Calculator, respectively. The
class lectures were primarily devoted to a discussion of basic construction of
digital computers, and their use in the solution of scientific computations
encountered in the solution of simultaneous algebraic equations, inversion of
matrices, solution of ordinary differential equations, etc.

Bececuse of the availability of the Type 650 Magnetic Drum Calculator,
it was decided that the subject content of 6.538 should be revised considerably.
Accordingly, during the Spring Term 1956 all of the above-mentioned electronic
experiments were deleted from the subject content and the subject was devoted
entirely to the application and use of digitel computing equipment. The
students were taught the basic principles of digital computers by performing
experiments on card punches, sorters, accounting machines, the Card Programmed
Calculator, and the Type 650 Magnetic Drum Cslculator. The principle emphasis
was actuslly devoted to a study of the use of the 650 machine in the solution
of "scientific and business data processing problems”.

Students were taught to program the CH0 by tT familiar with
the basic 650 language. After the basic language was understood, they were
taught the "following interpretive systems:

1. MITSS MIT Selective System
2. MITIIAC FLOATING DECIMAL Interpretive-mnemonic coding (1600)

3. NOPI Fixed and Floating Interpretive-numeric coding (600)
4, SOAP Symbolic Optimal Assembly Program

5. FLIMSY Floating Interpretive Matrix System (815)

G6. BIL Fixed and Floating Interpretive-numeric coding (1000)

It is obvious that the students were not able to become completely familiar with
2ll of the above systems. All students instructed now understand the 650
langusge, MITSS, and MITILAC. However, only certain students became familiar.
with each of the other systems Ey upon their particular interest.

The following list of homevoris Ee experiments were persormed during
this subject:

i. Problem 1 - Laboratory use of the Type 026 Card Punch and
Type 082 Sorter

The student spends two hours in the laboratory using the
cayd punch and sorter to prepare and sort several hundred
iB8 punched cards, thus insuring complete familiarity with
these two machines. :

Problem No. 2 - Design of Punched Card System to Handle
Business Data Processing Work at the Eastern Joint Computer
Conference

This problem teaches the importance of overall flow
charts ; the design of suitable IEM card layout forms, the
preparation of accurate instructions for machine operating
personnel, and the estimation of the personnel and machine time

. required to handle the registration for 2,000 attendees at the

conference.

Problem No. 3 - The Solution of a First Order Differential
Equation on the Type 650 Magnetic Drum Calculator

The student is given a block diagram of a 650 program -
used to solve an ordinary differential equation using fourthe
order Runge~Kutta formulae. As part of the assignment, the -
student prepares the actual coding of the 650 program using
basic language, prepares a test solution for this program,
computes a few check points, debugs his program on the 650,
and finally carries out the solution of this problem on the
machine. After completing this particular experiment, the
student has a very intimate knowledge of the 850 machine.

Solution of an Ordinary Differential Equation on the 650

The student solves the identical problem stated in the
preceding section using the Card Programmed Calculator. This
teaches them the difference between the internally-stored program
features of the 650 and the card-programmed characteristics of
the Card Programmed Calculator.

Evalugtion of the Roots of a 98 degree Polynomial

A 650 program using the NOPI system was prepared which
evaluates the roots of the polynomial using Hitchcock's method.

Computation of the Actuarial Life Insurance Tables

Since a high degree 0f accuracy in this computation was
needed, the basic 650 language was modified to perform 20-digit
arithmetic in the solution of this problem.

 

Inversion of Matrices using Modified Elimination Procedure

A basic 650 program was prepared which automatically
includes a 'pivotal-condensation' technique. This program
correctly handles matrices which have zero elements on the
Bein diagonal.

given target nuclide in a given neutron flux at any time.

Computation of Interest Calculations for Savings Banks.

A basie 650 ‘program was proparad which automatically
handles any any of the six different methods for performing interest
calculations arising in the savings bank.

Computation of Bivariate Frequency Distributions on the 850

A basic 650 program was prepared which computes the
bivariate freguency distribution by corresponding class intervals
(for various parameters), and also computes certain statistics
obtained from the above-mentioned distribution. An effective

method of storage allocation is employed which employs 2 neat

trick for obtaining the desired arguments and functions in an
internally-stored table of values.

Study of Optimum Programing on the 650 Calonlator

A besic 650 program was prepared which studied various
methods for “for effecting semi~optinmum data storage on the drum,

Preliminary Anglysis of an Inventory Control System

A non-machine study of the many problems arising in a
systems study of the overall inventory control problem.
Detailed description is given of the nsture of transactions
involved, comsiderations involving volume of data, rate of
information flow, need for rearrangement of computational
procedure, study of the effects of errors, breakdown, and
interruptions, and finally a consideration of problem areas
of interest to management to provide better overall control.

Solution of a Payroll Problem on the G50 Calculator

A basic 650 progrmm was prepared for a hypothetical
payroll involving 200 employees. The study included a
consideration of piece-work as well as the regular payroll
in which employees switch back and forth several times each.
day. Th? usual items such as, regular pay, overtime pay, bond
deduction, hospitalization, income tax, union dues, credit
union, Community Chest end other miscellaneous deductions, were
included.

Hitchcock's Method for Svaluating the Roots of a Polynomial

A basic 650 program was prepared for evaluating the roots
of a polynomial, Particular emphasis was given To a con-
sideration of polynomials which cannot be handied by this method.

Study of Series-Parallel Switching Functions

A basic 650 program was prepared for evaluating the
switching functions of six or fewer variables. The program
employed is a modification of the McCluskey Quine reduction
procedure by means of which the preliminary implicants and
pinimur sum forms of the switching functions were obtained.
The solutions of 86 different problems were performed during
the course of this study.

Solution of Spheriodal Antennae Equation Using the 650

A NOPI program was prepared for the solution of this
equation using Milne's predictoxr-corxrector formulae.

650 Solution of the Production Scheduling Problem

A MITSS program was prepared for the solution of this
problem which determined production curves which minimize costs
for a single arbitrary sales forecast. Graphical results were
obtained which related the sensitivity of the solutions for
various system parameters using a quadratic production cost
function,

Solution ef the Inventory Control Problem on the 650 Calculator

A basic 650 program was prepared for a simplified inventory
control problem. Specifically, the program was designed to
handle any number of stock-numbered items up to 34-per-day iteas.
The program was limited to control and reporting of customer
products only. No attempt was made to control the component parts
for the items, Similarly, no attempt was made to report the raw
material requirements.

XXXII. Study of Brokerage Accounting

A basic 650 program was prepared for calculating the items
appearing in the transaction statement of a customer's brokerage
account, The following items were included in this study:

1, Commercial postage and insurance,
2. Federal transfer taxes, |

3. State transfer taxes,
4. S.E.C. fees.

Naturally a program of this type cannot be gll inclusive and a
number of simplifying assumptions had to be made to effect the
solution of the program in a reasonable amount of time.

A consideration of the above list reveals that a wide variety of
problems were considered. It must be emphasized that the latter group of
subjects were performed on a "term paper’ basis. That is, these studies
were performed on an individual basis, and elabarate reports were prepared
describing the problem statement, the actual 650 program, the results obtained,
and a summary and evaluation of the paper. Although the term paper was expected
to require 30-40 hours of home and laboratory work, the actual time put in by
the students varied enormously. For example, this time ranged from 30 hours
to 360 hours, respectively. In the latter case, students intend to use this
topic as a basis for their master's theses during succeeding terms, :

It is appavent from the above course description that an attempt was
made to cover both scientific computing and electronic deta processiag in the
subject. This can indeed be dome, particularly when individual term papers
ave assigned. However, as time goes on it may be advisable to separate this
subject into two distinct subjects, one dealing solely with scientific computing
and the other with business date processing.

This subject was taught by Dr. F. HM. Verzuh, Director, Office of
Statistical Services. There were 26 students enrolled in Subject 6.538 during
the Spring Term 1956 of which there we: 12 Electrical Engineering students,
4 Chemical Engineering students, one Geophysics student, 3 Economics students,
2 Business Administration students, and 4 Mathematics students, respectively.
This was the first time students were able to use the 650 Calculator as part of
their laboratory work. Judging by the large number of this group -~ 12 studenis =-
who are now using the machine for the solution of their thesis problems, it
appears that the subject was highly successiul.


—Q=

Sa in addition to the solution of scientific computing and business
processing problems, a number of classroom lectures were devoted to the
consideration and evaluation of the relstive merits of the many commexciglly-
available electronic data processing systems. Specifically, this was achieved
by a study of 16 representative intermediate-size drum computers, and seven
of the large-scale systems -- BIZMAC, Datamatic 1000, ERA 1103, IBM 704,
IBM 703, Raycom, and UNIVAC, respectively. Since many of the students were
entering various large business, industrial, and government concerns, it was
important that they have some knowledge of some of the relative merits of the
individual systems. Finally, several lectures were devoted to the IBM 704

Calculator which will be installed in the M.I.T. Computation Centex in the
near future.

Summary of Student Enrollment Statistics

: A detailed description of the course content of the subjects
listed in the introduction is given in the M,I.T. Catalogue.

An indication of the interest in machine ccmputation may be
obtained by considering the following enrollment in each of these subjects
during the academic year 1255~1036:

it is apparent from the above list that the total sttendance in these 1ll subjects
was 768 students. This does nei mean, hoWever, that there were 768 individuals
involved since many of the students tock a number of the above subjects, thus the
actual number of individugs exposed te machine cemputation is considerably less.
