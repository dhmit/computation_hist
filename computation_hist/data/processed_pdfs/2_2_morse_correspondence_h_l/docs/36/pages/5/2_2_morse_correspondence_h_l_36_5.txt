6.The program for Whirlwind I. A flow diagram f.or the program 18
<shown in Fig. 3; the following features require explanation:

(a) Main program refers to the calculation of R, R/, and T as f\lllctiqns
of n and k using ) into point

(1501205 iy (7). 1t transforms point (n, k
(R, T) or (R, T). (See Switch.)

(b) Yes-no decision. Whirlwin

d I can choose between two courses of

action by consulting the sign of any number stored in the memory.

(¢) Directing counter. For the computation of the partial derivatives,
the main program 18 used three times; each of these main program calcula-
tions is followed by 2 particular sequence of operations—t.hc first by chang-
ing n, the second by changing k, the third by the calculation of the partial
derivatives. Therefore, the machine must keep track of the required opera-
tion that is to follow each performance of the main program. The direct-
quence of orders and two control registers whose
sign digits are changed each time the

(d) Swilch. The switch 1s a simplified directing counter. It consists of a
register whose sign 1s determined by whether film incidence or backing
incidence is under consideration. A positive sign indicates film incidence;
g incidence. Initially, the switch has a posi-

hanged when backing incidence is reported.

(e) Data for backing incidence. 1t has been shown that for a given set of
n and & the transmission 7' is the same when radiation 1s incident on the
film as for radiation incident on the backing, but that the reflectance 1S
different for the two cases. The main program computes R and T when the
switeh is set positive, and R’ and T when the switch is set negative. Gener-
