A CONFERENCE OF |
UNIVERSITY COMPUIING CENTER DIRECTORS.

June 2=4, 1960, Sahih: ) { v5)

BACKGROUND.

In the Dash sen years the number, of university computing
nT adozen To ware thon a howd Ack,
centers has increased, 5 : E s the directors of these cwlrs
rew—heedtitdos have Sev zgled with ehe problems of introducing
new facilities and intellectual disciplines into their schools |
it has become clear == {oc them, if not to others == that the
tasks of University Computing Centers are spaclal ones, different
from those of other computing CELers, and peculiarly important
for the development of Computer Science in thls country. liany
directors came to feel that there was a need fora conference ab
which experiencef could be interchanged regarding these tasks
and, topefutlys a concensus could be reached regarding desirable
methods for thelr accomplishment,
Advantage was taken of the meeting of many Pniversity
Computing Center Directors at an I.B.l. Seminar at Poughkeepsie,
i) «Loy dune 22-26, 1959, to form a Committee to investigate
further the advisability of such a conference and, if found
desirable, to orffhize one and #4 project its program. The
Committee, in its final form, comprised |

 

Philip M. Morse, MIT, Chairman

A total of 5 par eloip: Gs attended the Conference, 26

the west coast, 1 from Canada and 1 from the Hetherlands,
Appendix B is a LL of these participants. Jost of a
chang

was aun of all parts of the me ¥ as well as of all
sizes of Computing Centers.

The agenda of the meeting, given in detail in Appendix 2h
C, provided time for general discussion of the major wgdas of 2
interest as well as opportunity for detailed discussion in &
smaller groups. During the first doy agreement was reached on £&
the topics which were to be discussed in the later sessions and
the division of these topics into five groupings, which could be 3
dealt with in detall by five panels. During the second day the ==

- Conference split into these five Pancla:

 

1. Computer-oriented Research (what are the areas, of real
intellectual challenge, for research in the use of computing
machines? How are students to be attracted to these areas?)
Panel Chairman, \.B.Kehl, Univ.of Pittesburg; Coghairman, HK

2. Curriculmum and Instruction (what sort of courses are
being offered in Computer Science and what others should be

realistic, that they include costs of staff and administration
of the Center, esmortization charges for the machine and of the

time in SH to survive is an anomaly on a university campus,
(Less than ten percent of the conferees represented Centers which
sold more than 20 percent of their machine time). Vhether the
financial support for operating the Center comes from educational
funds, overhead or from long-term grants from industry or ZOV=

usefulness to nearly all intellectual activities, all depart=

Center (as with the university iibrary). In MaNY , GSS the

Center has been established as an interdeparitmental and inter

gchool facility, with separate budget end staff, though some of

the staff vasedi have joint appointments to the center and to
some appropriate department. In these cases the Director of the

Center should report to an appropriate academic authority, such

as a Dean or Provost, not to a purely administrative authority,

   
 
 

such as a Re POF Imsasuver. In cases where the Center is

In general it was es that class=room use of the analing
should have first priority (within certain limits, of course) and
that priorities on research time should not favor the paying
users, if there are any.

It also was generally egreed that university computing
centers should run, ss far as possible, on an "open=shop” er
1e€e.y that the users should program and code thelr own probigfins
and, as far as is appropriate with the ejuipment, shodl partic
ipate in running the problem on the machine. The task of the
Center staff, therefore, shduld not be to encode problems for
machine users, but should be to instruct in coding and advise
on programming, to maintain a library of standard programs and
sub=-routines and to develop machine and programming techniques
which will make the computer more effective and easier To use.
