Allocation of Overhead Costs on 8 Machine Utilization Basis

It must be emphasized that the distridbution of the

overhead cests given in Table I is at best a very rough

stimate, This is perticularly true of the supervision and
administration costs, The principal reason for the rough-
ness of the estimate is the lack of operational experlence
with the Card Programmed Caiculator. However, 1f the above
distribution {s mccepted as & basis for cost allocatlen, the
following procedure may be used:

1, Distribute the overhead ccats for the tpcc!nl M -
chines among the underwriters on a percentage
basis = the percentage is to be based on the
menthly rental cost of the machine., Specifically,

Under~ Percent~- Monthly

The column labslled "Monthly Overhead Charge” is obtalned by
distributing 4074.15/8.333-5488,%0 per month {the estimated
overhead charges associated with special machines) on & pere
centage baslis, The percentage is, of course, determined by
the monthly rental cost of the machine,

This overhead cost is to be bllled to each of these
projects each menth aleng with the associated menthly rental
cost of the particular machine,

2., The overhead costs appearing in Table I in the
column lubelled Regular Machines is to be distributed
in accordance with the established formulae which
employ the machine utilization factor. (see pp.7-9
of the report dated Cetcber 1, 1952).
