Dear Gordon: a5

Professor Morse left for Europe on the afternoon of
May ninth, and I was able to see him only briefly at a
committee meeting that morning. He did not have a chance
to write a letter, but 1 took notes on his comments, the
sense of which I reproduce below.

Of the people in the computer field with an adequate
reputation for the job of heading up a large effort by
M.I.T. in establishing a central computing facility, Perlis
is the only one with the combination of reputation, techni-
cal ability and maturity for this kind of job. Morse would
hesitate to recommend any of the other major figures in the
field for this job, and feels that if we don't get Perlis,
we should probably breed our own. His evaluation of Perlis
is based on about three years of professional contact.

Sincerely yours,

Peter Elias
