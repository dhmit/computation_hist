To provide protection against misordering the cards during
fnanual processing, each card should have 3 unique number punched
into it. This number may be modified during computer processing
1':0 provide a cross reference between the concordance and the orig=-
inal text, Again with an €ye toward program generality, a ten-digit
card number has been agreed upon. In our present application, the
digits will be assigned as follows:

Book 1 digit

Chapter 2 digits
Section 2 digits
Page 3 digits
Line 2 digits

Other punching conventions to be used include the employment of the
$ to indicate the end of a sentence and the # to indicate an omission.
Verification of the key-punching is optional and dependent upon the
reliability of the original key=-puncher,

The next step in processing is to transcribe these cards to
magnetic tape,

The first computer operation is called the input data edit and
will perform several functions:

a) Sequence-check the input data on the basis of the ten-
digit card identifier;

b) Provide notification of any sequence errors and make

some assumptions (such as, a sequence break indi-

cates the start of a new sentence) and continue pro-

cessing;

Using the first (five) digits of the sequence number as

a base, and detecting the beginnings of sentences,

create a (seven) digit number of the following format:

C

S

Book 1 digit

Chapter 2 digits
Section 2 digits
Sentence 2 digits

d) Match each complete word, including rejoined hyphe-
nated words, against a small dictionary of frequently
occurring words to be omitted;

e) If the word is not to be omitted, compose a card-length
record for it b-;—space-filling to the right up to a pre-~
