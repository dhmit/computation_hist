Dear Professor Morse:

Sometime ago we received Fromiyon an account of your plans for
a digital computing laboratory at your institution. It was sub=
mitted in gnticipsiion of a program in the National Science Foundation
for the support of university computing facilities. Since the
President's Budget contains an item for Facility Support by NSF, you
may wish to consider submitting a proposal along the lines of your
earlier communication,

Although no assurance can be given at this time as to the avail-

ability of funds, you may be sure that, if funds are available, all

proposals will receive the most serious consideration.

Sincerely yours,

Leon We Cohen
Program Director for
Mathematical Sciences
