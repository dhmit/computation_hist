Minutes of the Seventeenth Meeting
of the
Committee on Machine Methods of Computation

Persons Pregents OC. W. Adams, Z. Kopal, C. Lin, P. M. Morse and
E. Reissner

The final list of appointments for research assistantships
for next year wag discussed. Kopal reported that Mr. Taylor, who
would have been appointed to the Electrical Engineering Depart-
ment, hes relinquished his assistantship and is coming from
England on a speclal English scholarship. Consequently, there is,
at present, no appointment from the Electrical Engineering De-
partment.

Reissner reported that kr. Hicks is coming as an assistant,
but that Oliver Smith had relinquished his appointment. Howevar,
he recormended that Mr. W. V. Caldwell and Mr. P. T. Hsu be ap-
pointed as half-time assistants from the Mathematics Department.
This was approved by the Committee and it is understood that the
Mathematics Department will write these applicants. The case of
Mr. Rosenblum was agaln considered and it was finally decided not
to appoint him. Consequently, the Math. Department has three
assistants appointed at present -- Hicks, Caldwell and Hsu.

Morse reported that, at present, there are four pre-doctoral
regearch assistants appointed in Physics -- Corbatd, Newstein,
sartori and Miss Altman; that there is one post-doctoral -- Sol
I. Rubinow. He recommended that one further appointment be made
Â«= ir, Aaron Temkin. This was approved by the Committee. IL Mr.
Temkin accepts this will make five pre-doctoral appointments and
one post-doctoral appointment from Physics.

It was suggested that the next meeting of the Committee be
some time before the tenth of Jume, and that if any member of the
Committee had business to take up, he should notify the Chairman.
