SUBJECT: Katerial for National Science Foundation Proposal

 

 

In accordance with our discussions regarding the proposal to NSF, ‘
I am enclosing the following inter-nation.

 

 

 

Machine calmnt 2!; the ILLT. Mutation Center

no ILLT. Commutation Center will have a Type 704 Electronic
Data Processing lachine with the following machine complement:
12 magnetic tape units, 2 magnetic CORE storage units containing a
total of 8, 000 words, 1 magnetic drum unit containing 4, 000 words
of storage, the usual on-line punched card reader, alphabetic printer,
and punched card recorder as ”well as the 3 o__ff-line magnetic tape
controlled printer, magnetic tape controlled —can— punch, and punched
cani—to-magietic tape converter, respectively. Total machine
“ complement net monthly rental is slightly over $45,000. In addition

to the 104, there will be lo auxiliary punched card machines including

L" Q card punches, collators, sorter-s, reproducere, interpreters, and the
Type 407 Accounting Machine. The aggregate machine rental is in
excess of 3 50,000 per month.

 

The Type 704 EDP! unit is one of the fastest large-scale
commercial computers available today. Since the ILLT. installation
will be but one of many in the field, techniques, programs, and
numerical procedures developed for this machine will he of universal use.

Biographical Information

 

Dr. F. l. Verzuh, Director of. Statistical Services, has been
connected with the operation of ILLT. computational work since 1940.
In this capacity he has had considerable experience with the utilization
of various analog computing equipment -- differential analyzers, etc.,
as well as a complete line of digital machines ranging from the IBM
Type 601 through the Type 704.

He received a 3.5. degree in Electrical Engineering iron the
University of Denver in 1940, a ILS. degree in Electrical Engineering
from 11.1.1‘. in 1946, and a Son. degree in Electrical Engineering from
MJJ‘. in 1952.

In the Office of Statistical Services he is concerned with the
utilization of In punched card equipment to fulfill the need of the
LLT. educational and research projects. In this connection a
number of research contracts have been executed for various branches
of the armed services. In July, 1955 he was placed in charge of the
operation 01 the Whirlwind Computer -- the high-speed machine currently
used for scientific research at the Institute. Again, several research
projects are being conducted using this computer as a basic tool.
