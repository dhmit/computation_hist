5. Improved Programmling System. I have a number of de-
tailed proposals for improvements which we can make in our TO4
system quickly and which will save large amounts of tlme.

Here I only remark that
1. A large fraction, 40 per cent, of our runs involve
less than .5 minutes computer time but take longer because
l) System tape twiddling
2) Card reading time
3 Operator reactlion time
A system which assumes that every run requires
32K of memory and 1is of the most complicated sort allowed.

MYy main proposals are for an operator system for Fortran
complled decks and a fast-service small job system for SAP
language programs. The latter, if fast-service system runs
were given priority, could cut 50 per cent of our present time
load in 3 and make another 15 per cent program more efficiently
in order to stay in the fast-service system.

This has an lmportant general application. While the demard
for computation from big users is insatiable, the amounts of
computation required per run range over factors of 104 and will
go larger. Small users can eventually be given dlal-tone-like
gservice without clogging the computer,

6. Making Big Users Pay. There do not seem to ne enough
sultable g users.

T. Enforcement of Allotments. If supplementary allotments
are always available, the allotment system does not really exist.

8. OR Study. Why delay longer?
