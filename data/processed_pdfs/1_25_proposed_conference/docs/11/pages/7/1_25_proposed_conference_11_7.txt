Center (as with the university library). In meny esses the
Center has been established as an interdepartmental and inter-
gchool facility, with separate budget and sbtaff, though some of
the staff usa&%&uahave joint appointments to the center and to
some appropriate department., In these cases the Director of the
Center should report to an appropriate academic authority, such
as a Dean oT Provost, not o a purely aduninistrative authority,

Tn general it was aggeed that class-room use of the machine

1t also was generally agreed that university computing
centers should run, sas far as possible, on an "open=shop" oa81s,
ie€.y that the users should program and code their own prc’b@sns
and, as far as is appropriate with the ejuipment, shodl partic-
ipate in running the problem on the machine, The task of the
Center staff, therefore, shduld not be to encode problems for
machine users, but should be to instruct in coding and advise
on programming, to maintain a library of standard programs and
sub=routines and to develop machine and programming technigues
which will make the computer more effective and easier to use,
