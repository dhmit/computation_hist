four or five good men, research men ‘plus the technicians to back

B . years to get rolling and the developments

should be reviewed at the end of three years, to see where to go
next. Such a staff should be moré important during the beginning
stages of the utilization of electronic computers, when the prob-.

- lems are not too clearly formulated and when nelther partner in

____ the team knows the others plans and ideas. Later, when some of

the more important potentialities have been demonstrated, the
research can be split up into projects, each with d definite goal
and with its own budget, which can include partial support for
the continuing staff of the Center. 8o, eventually, the Center
could be financed indirectly by contributions from each project
which uses 1ft, 1f this were considered to be the most desirable
way of keeping it going. At present, however, support by contribu-
tions from established research projects can only support about a
third of the 100,000 needed, which would leave unsupported the
most frultful research of all, the unknown results which are sure
to come when a machine expert of the Center staff works together
with the economist, psychologist or sociologist, on the faculty
of one of our participating colleges who comes to the Center with
only a "gleam in his eye."
Possible Initial Directions for Investigation

As indicated, we cannot write down in any detail the

directions which this research effort will take, as the varqpus

teams are formed and begin to interact. There are several general
