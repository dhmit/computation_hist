Attn: WCRR

This shipment ccnsists of one reproducible (transparent
nzalid) and four copies.

Ag 1 promised Dr. E. PF, Little during his visit
te M, I. T. on April 9, 1953, I am also including in the
above shipment § coples of Technical Report R-52 entitled
"Techniques for Sclving Fixede«Gun Alrcraft Pursuit Preblem
on the Rockefeller Differential Analyzer.” This report
describes work which we have performed on the ¥M, 1. T.
Rockefeller Differential Analyzer. You will notice that
it actually bears another Alr Force Contract number. This
was necessary because the costs of the operation of the
Anai yzer are being supported by this latter contract. Since
this work is described In our (umarterly Progress Report

{page 10 and reference 6), I felt it advisacle to send copies
for your use,

Irv conclusion, I wish to remind yeu that our local
De Io Co, Uf{ice has requested an extension of our contract

no, AF33{6168)=128 through December 31, 1953 without additional
funds.

Very truly yours,
