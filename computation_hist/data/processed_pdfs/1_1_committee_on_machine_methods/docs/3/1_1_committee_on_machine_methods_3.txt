Minutes of the Third lieeting
of the
Committee on Machine Methods of Computation

December 6, 1950

Members Present: G. S. Brown, H. Feshbach, J, W. Forrester,
Z. Kopal, C, Lin, P. M. llorse and E, Reissner

Professor Heissner reported on the procedure for doctor's
candidates in the Department of Mathematics. A written quali-
fying examination, similar to that in Physics, 1s given, usuzl-
ly at the end of the first year. This is based on the materiel
in five undergraduste and beginning graduate courses: Algebra,
Analysis, Geometry, and two terms of Complex Variables. The
Committee felt that little modification of this preliminary ex-
amination would be needed for men wishing to obtain a degree
from tne Mathematics Department in Numerical Analysis. Perhaps
a few less questions could be asked in Complex Variables and
Geometry, and a few questions could be added on Numerical
Analysis, or Machine lethods or on Physics, but tnut the modi-
fications could be taken up wnen a specific exauple &rose.
ifter some discusslon, it sppeared probable to the Comulttee
that, for the time, most graduate students coming in to the
field of Numericsl Analysis would pe fairly well grounded in
the undergraduate subjects of eitner the Matnematics course or
the Electrical bkngineering course, and that tuerefore most of
the students which thls Coumittee might help supervise could be
handled by suitable minor modifications of either the Electrical
Engineering or mathematics qualifying examination. Sooner or
later, of course, as the Ccumittee becawe better known, cases
would &rise which would not fit these two alternatives. It was
felt, however, thnat such problems were best treated az they

Two specific cases of men in the Mathematics Department
were discussed: Helwig and Porter. They have taken the neces-
sary undergreduate courses in Mathematics, but they have not
vet taken tneilr qualifying written exam. It 1s felt, however,
tnat tnere is no particular provlem in their taking the regular
Bathematics exem, and thet the Committee can first help in
tnese causes in helping supervise taeir thesis research.

At this time, Professor Gordon Brown czme to the meeting
and the discussion turned to consideration of the specific
cases of graduate students in the Electrical Engineering Depart-
ment. The following tentiétive decisions and guestions were
realised:


Minutes of the Third Meeting of ths
Committee on Machine Methods of Computation 2

(1) Salzer. He nas taken his written examination, but not
his oral preliminary. A supervisory committee (Kopal, Hazen,
Linvill) has been appointed. Professor Brown is to consult as
to whether it would be more spproprizte to have Professor Thomas
of the Mathematics Department on the committee, instead of Pro-
fessor Hazen, If thls is not desirable, no change is to be made
here, :

(2) Ham. His supervisory committee is yet to be appointed.
It was suggested that Professor Feshbuach might be a suitable
member of this committee. Professor Brown will advise us later,

(3) Carrus has not yet tukenhls written qualifying exeminae
tiony he will probably take it in February. It was suggested
that the usual Electrical Engineering written exawination be
modified in his case to de-emphasize power machinery, magnetic
circuits, and electrical measureuents, &nd tnut Professors Lin
and Relssner arrange to provide questions for one of the turee
toree=-hour examinations to be given in the subjects of courses
i351, W352 and M39, to be substituted instead of the exam on the
the three subjects to be de-emphasized. In addition, Professors
Feshbach and Morse will help in writing questions on Physics for
this part of the examination. Professor Brown is to notify the
four Committee members involved as to deadline dates on taese
questions.

(4) Booton is intending to take tne regular Klectricul En-
gineering written examination, although Professor Brown will ask
“him whether he would prefer to tuke the sawe examination as is
planned for Carrus. |

(5) Hiss Fox has dropped ner registration for tne present,
but will, it is s hoped, return next year. - Presumably, she would
take the regular Mzthematics qualifying written.

(6) Dolansky may &lso be a suitable person to take the ex-
amination prepared for Carrus, but any action will await Pro-
fessor Brown's word in the matter.

(7) Verzuh. This case is to be taken up again next time,
since it involves certain fundamental policies which need more
detailed consideration. Professor Brown will meet with the Com-
mittee next Wednesday at 10:00 4. K,
