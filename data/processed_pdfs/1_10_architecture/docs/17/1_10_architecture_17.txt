Mr, Peterson suggested that we make studies for ventilating and alr con-
ditigning the I, Bes M. Computation Area on the following basisy

a, Two (Z) separate A, C, units - one (1) for machine supply and ome (1)
for interior supply.

b, A combination of both systems into ons with two separate supply fans;
one (1) for machine supply and one (1) for interior supply.

Mr. Payson Hun'ex checked ine space allccations aguingt ranutramaents
and found that {, RB, M, had a total of approximately 800 square feet more
than they requested for all tioors,

[here was some doubt expres sed by Io BoM, as to the actual need for a
dumbwaiter in the Machine Roam. Mr, Payson Hanter will reconsider
the need for u and make a recommendation,

if ducts and cables are 0 be placed in the floor, 14' will be required be-
rwesn the steel plate and concretie slabs, Thio space gold be redwcad to
gn if gables alone were provided for, It was fait that the mechanical gn-

gingers would make thelr duct and cable layeuis based om the 89 dimension.
