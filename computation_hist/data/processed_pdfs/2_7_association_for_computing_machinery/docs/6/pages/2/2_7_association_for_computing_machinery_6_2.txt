A method of computation for spherieal Bessel functions
of real and imaginary avgument is given which is especlally
suitable for digital computers. The method involves the use of
resurrence relations with unnormalized values of the functlon.
The accuracy and convergence are examined and criterion foramulas
are given. A procedure based on the Wronskian 1s used to simplify
the final normalization.
