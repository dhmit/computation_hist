The Committee discussed the remainil; cases of ap—
pointments for the following year“ Two appli«atiors in Mathe-
matics , Bennington and Archer were discussed by the Committee
and were left for Reissner and Lin to make firal decision on
whether or not they were to be appointed. It was also agreed
that the Physics Department would appoint Hv.£tory to take the
place of the earlier appointment of A. Duran, now deceased.

The discussion then turned to the question of the
preliminary courses in Numerical Analysis to be given next
year. Reissner and Lin reported that there was some feeling
that the first—term course should be an undergraduate senior
course rather than a graduate course, This was discussed.

The Committee did not come to any final concltsion, but there
was some feeling the; it might be better to hsVe both courses
listed as graduate courses at least at first {particularly since
M351, the suggested prerequisite, is a gradua¢e course). '
Mr. Grosnh discussed the subject matter of tha course he was
interested in giving and suggested that he Peidips Should give
the first term and Evofessor Hildebrand the ss2>nd rather than
the reverse" The consensus of opinion of the.2)mmittea seemed
counter to this ideal It-waa suggested that ‘rosc? end Hilde—
brand get together in the near future to see ixether a combined
schedule of two one-term courses, with ldebzind giving the
first course, registered in the Mathematics Diiartsent, and
Grosch giving the second course, listed in the Electrical

   

-Engineering Department (at least for the firei yeax or so)

could not be worked nut. Mor3e expects to has? frcm Grosch
and Hildebrand next JGek.

Professor drones and his assistants in tke Flight
Simulator Project discussed the development 01 their project
and indicated that they were anxious that the equipment involved
be made available fee educational and general research activitie
of the Institute. rse outlined the activities of the Committe ,
indicated that it 2 possible that some of tre assistsntship
financing contcolle. by the Committee might be useful in support
ing some men e king with this equipment for zﬂvanced degrees,

. and asked whether some of the new assistants arriving this summer
and fall could be trained in the use of the equipment. Hronas
and Seifert and Boat-021 indicated that this was possible and Morse
said that when plats for the summer anrl fall could be worked ova,
he would get in to: ch with them again no see show, details.
