data would help this work as well as others. Another promising
direction of investigation is in the application of machine tech-
niques to library inventorying, cataloging and record-keeping.
Although specialopurpose machines will probably be required in the
end, many ideas and procedures can be developed and checked out on
the general-purpose machine at the Center with the addition, per-
haps, of some specially built input and output equipment. The
staff of the MIT Library is interested in this work and will con-
tribute its knowledge to its progress. .

c. Perhaps the most promising line of advance, in part
because the least investigated up till now, is in the field of
social science experiments, where the computer can be used as
recorder, scorer and referee. Tactical situations in warfare are'
already being studied by "gaming techniques" at Band and in other
military operations research groups. Similar problems in various
fields of the social sciences can also be studied by simplifying
the situation down to some sort of "game", with more or less com-
plioated rules, which can be played by groups of investigators, to
see what the consequences are of various strategies. If the I'games"
are to correspond, even distantly, to some actual social situation,
the rules must be quite complicated and the scoring will require a
great deal of statistical computation. It has been found that only
by the use of computing machines can the scoring be speeded up
sufficiently so that enough games can be run through to provide
an over~all grasp of the situation under study. Such "gaming
techniques“ are closely related to the experiments of Bavelas on
the behavior of task-oriented groups. The use of a properly pro-
grammed computer would provide such experiments with a powerful
and flexible means of changing, controlling, and analyzing these
experiments in social psychology. In this field we could work in
close collaboration with the Center for International Studies at
MIT and with the psychology departments in several other colleges.

Suggested Guidance for the Research
___i..________,___i___u._____.___

The research activities of the Computation Center are
guided and coordinated by an Advisory Committee consisting of
representatives from each of the participating colleges, each
chosen by the president of his coll? “ This Committee provides
over-all policy guidano lﬂ all actit es. But to guide the work
in social science out 6 above, we will need another, more spe-
cialized group. if f 1 support for this activity is forth-
coming, about six t. social scientists from the participating
institutions will he ion to Join a special advisory committee,
to talk over possible of research with the Center staff, to
help find those soc ate with "gleams in their eyes" re-
garding machine uti 1 their field, to help arrange the
formation of teams ‘ " it of the suggested research and

to advise on rela A if and when there is more work
to be done than th time available.
