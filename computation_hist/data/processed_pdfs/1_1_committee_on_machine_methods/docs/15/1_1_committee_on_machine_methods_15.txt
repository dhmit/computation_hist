Committee on Machine Methods of Computation

April 11, 1951

Persons Presents ER. R. Everett, H. Feshbach, Z. Kopal, C. Lin,
P. M, Morse, and E. Reissner

The Committee discussed several new proposals for research
assistantships for the prograrn for next year. The Mathematics
members reported that they had no further recoimencations at
present, though there might be more to recommend later. Pro-
fessor Kopal reported that Leigh, who had been offered an as-
sistantship, has taken a job slsewhere, and that I'razier has been
ziven a full-time job with Vhirlwind., This, consequently, leaves
the one Blectrical Engineering possibility, W. K. Taylor from
Bnzland, as still being on the list. Keopal hopes to hear from
hin in the near future. The Physics Department reported that
Mr. Spelsaan had taken a position elsewhere and proposed Leo
Sartori to take his place. This was approved by the Committee.

Morse reported the final program for the Conference on Use
of Computing Machines in Industry for May second and third.
After a short discussion on the methods of supervising the re-~
search assistants next year, and on the supervision of Verzuh's
thesia, the Committee adjourned.

There will be a meeting of the Committee next Wednesday,
April 18, at 10:00 A.M., unless it turns out that there are no
applications for consideration.
