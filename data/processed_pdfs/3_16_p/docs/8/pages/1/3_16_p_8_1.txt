M, I. T,

Dear Carl:

Now that Winter is almost upon us, I am again writing to
you concerning the various items of unfinished construction in the
Computation Center. Speecifically, there has beeun no action on the
following letters: 1) dated July 11, 1957, 2) dated August 27, 18567,
3) dated September 30, 1957, In addition to the above items, I would
like to add the following:

1., Doors

All of the doors on the fist floor of the Computation
Center have a 1" or 1/2" gap which allows dirt and
cold to enter. For ezample, we must weather strip the
door of the Receiving Room (26-140). The programming
staff in rooms 139 and 143 are freezing because the
cold air enters this room through the open shipping
Yoo .

2, aumber of the metal doors on the first floor can no
nger be opened (only with difficulty) because of
sagging of the building, e.g., rooms 169, 161, and 157,
respectively.

3. Various windows on the first floor have "warpedâ€™ to such
an extent that it is impossible to close theam {even if
you stand on an 8' iadder).

4. We are etill mbsing locks in rooms 054, 142A, 144.

5. 704 Room Flgor

covering the large holes in the 704 room using either
nasonite oy stesl plates, This must be done beiore
someons gets hurt,
