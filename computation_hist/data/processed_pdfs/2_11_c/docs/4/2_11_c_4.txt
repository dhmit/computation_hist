_ Dear John: '

, Thanks for your letter of December 22. I should be
happy indeed to hear from Hr. Anderson. I have not heard
from hen yet. Perhaps you could indicate to him that-1r he
wishes to apply for next year, he had better do it soon. ‘I‘
have spread the word about your needs at Ehapel H111 and now
that the vacations are over. I will mention it again.

We are all sorry that you will not be with us this
'ooming term. We hope your plans for Chapel Hill are going
smoothly and we hope to see you soon. Is there any chance
that you will come this way during the spring?

S inoere 1y,
