minutes of the Third Meeting of the
Committee on Machine Methods of Computation ~2-

(l) ﬁelzer. He has taken his written examination, but not
his oral preliminary. A supervisory committee (Kopal, Kazan,
Linvill) has been appointed. Professor Brown is to consult as
to whether it would be more appropriate to have Professor Thomas
of the Mathematics Department on the Committee, instead of Pro-
fessor Hazen. If this is not desirable, no change is to be made
here. '

(2) ﬂag. His supervisory committee is yet to be appointed.
It was suggested that Professor Feshbach might be a suitable
member of this committee. Professor Brown will advise us later.

(3) garrus has not yet takenkis written qualifying examina-
tion; he will probably take it in February. It was suggested
that the usual Electrical Engineering written examination be
modified in his case to de—emphasize power machinery, magnetic
circuits, and electrical measurements, and tnet Professors Lin
and Reissner arrange to provide questions for one of the three
threeanour examinations to be given in the subjects of courses
M351, M352 and M39, to be substituted instead of the exam on the
the three subjects to be deuemphasized. In addition, Professors
Feshbaoh and horse will help in writing questions on Physics for
this part of the examination. Professor Brown is to notify the
four Committee members involved as to deadline dates on these
questions.

(4) Bootgn is intending to take the regular Electrical En-
gineering written examination, although Professor Brown will ask
him whether he would prefer to take the same examination as is
planned for Carrus.

(5) Miss Fox has dropped her registration for the present,
but will, it is hoped, return next year. Presumably, she would
take the regular Mathematics qualifying written.

(6) Dolangky may also be a suitable person to take the ex-
amination prepared for Carrus, but any action will await Pro-
fessor Brown's word in the matter.

(?) Vergnh. This case is to be taken up again next time,
since it involves certain fundamental policies which need more
detailed consideration. Professor Brown will meet with the Com-

mittee next Wednesday at 10:00 A“ M.
