Boston, Massachusetts

Dear Dr. Case:

I am pleased to enclose a check for $900.00 for the second
semester portion of the Boston University appointment to the M.I. T.
Computation Center as described on the attached sheet. The IBM
Corporation is very grateful for the work of the Research Associates
and Assistants in the program for they have contributed a great deal to
its success.

There are now thirty-four colleges and universities in New
England participating with M.I.T. in the Computation Center. The new
IBM 709 has been in operation for four months, and already seventeen
of the colleges have made use of it. For your information, I am enclosing
a table of usage for the months September - December, 1960.

1 am delighted that Boston University continues to be a regular
user of the Center, and I am glad that IBM can have a part in your
strong educational program in the computation field.

With warmest personal regards.

Sincerely yours,

M. Loren Bullock
University Representative
