the usual response of a university administration is that, as
long as a University Computation Center (with its director) is willing
to prostitute itself to get money to support his salary and its
operation, they don't mind at all whether or not he teaches members
of its staff, its graduate students, etc., all sorts of information
through short courses not permitted in the catalog, etc.

Some of us have been lucky enough to evade some or all of these
major problems, but many university users are, I know, feeling
utterly hopeless in trying to continue a fight where there is no help at all
to draw upon. Any meetings which could help in these two areas

should certainly be given all our support, whether in connection with
other meetings or not.

I myself will be unable to attend the IBM conference in June since I
have not been invited, but I will be at the ICIP meeting in Paris, the
British Computer Society meeting in Cambridge, and the ACM meeting,
where I hope some of us from universities can continue the discussion
of these problems. Meanwhile, I would be very pleased to work with
you on either of the above ideas, or if they turn out to be too difficult,
any other ways of continuing communication among all of us. The

pace is so fast, I find, that I need continuing chances to draw upon
other people with the same problems. Useless, unplanned meetings,

of course, I am certainly heartily opposed to!

I want to thank you personally for your suggesting my name to

Dr. Thorndyke Saville for his study at the University of Florida. The
trip proved very worthwhile to me personally (and I hope to them as
well) in that it brought home, among other things, the two problems
noted above as they affect Florida. You may guess that what I learned
there caused me to think of the two problems stated above!

Sincerely yours,

John W. Carr, III, Director
Research Computation Center
