. We have @ wide range of problems from those of language Rk
translation to those of calculations of nuclear characteristics.
We do not code the usual problem which comes to us, so these
persons would be éngaged mainly in the special and interesting
problems and in writing out programs rather than detailed
coding (although there may be exeeptions)., By et

I would appreciate it if you could let me know of any
person who might be interested in taking sueh a position either
this spring or next summer, or in suggesting that such people
should write me directly. The Salary we would offer would be
normal to'universities, no as high as industrial positions, but
the man would have the opportunity of further ¢lass work and would
have contact with a widepr variety of problems than in industry.
