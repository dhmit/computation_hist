Newport, Rhode Island

Dear Captain Beebe:

I believe we now have a_i&nal schedule for your
visit here on Tuesday, November 13.

r/"

We have made arrangements for parking for about
three cars for the whole day, assuming that you would arrive
about 9.30 a.m. The cars should go to the parking lot
immediately behind the main buillding with entrance of f
Massachusetts Avenue. The drivers should report to the
guard in charge of the lot, giving your name and my name,
and say that they are to be shown to the speclal parking
places reserved for them.

Your party should then come to my office, Room
$=107. We will spend the morning discussing general
behavior of machines and some applications to naval prob-
lems. We had better break the morning at about 11.30 for
lunch because we have scheduled your party to see our
Whirlwind comput:r between 12.30 and 2.00. After 2.00 you
would be scheduled to get together at my office or some
room nearby for a question-and-discussion perilod which could
run on until 3.30 or 4.00, whenever you want to get started
back.

I hope this arrangement will be satisfactory.
Please let me know soon if you have any suggestions.

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse, Director
M.I.T. Computation Center
