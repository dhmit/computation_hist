MAC BKIP,THI, (ADD3,R, 3,T)
results in
™I ,.001
CLA R
ADD 8
STO T
50,001 SYN @

An explicitly empty argument terminated by & comma will be treated as empty;
created symbols will be supplied only at the end of the string of arguments.,
For example :

MAC ADD3 A, ,

compiles into

CLA A
ADD
ST0 ,,00n

where ,,00n is the amext available created symbol .,

Added Details on MOP

Those BCD characters vwhich are not legal as part of a macro name of
HOP? argument will be called breask characters, The complete list follows: W,
9 =y ® 1, (), $, comma, +0, -0, the redundant minus (which prints a quote
mark on some BTL equipment), blank, and all special characters., A blank if
encountered before colusmm 72 on any card except a BCD card is considered to
terminate the veriable field, and any information to the right of the blank
will appear in the listing of the macro definition but will not be stored as
part of the macro definition, In any cage, the variable field for a macro
definition or expansion stops with column 72, An EFC eard which follows imme-
diately may be used to continue the argument string of a MOP or MAC, The
maximun pumber of arguments which ean be used for a single macro is 63,

A macro name, or a substitutable symbol used within a macro definition,
may consist of from one to six legal BCD characters, excluding the break charac-
ters defined above, NMacro names may be entirely numeric, zero being an admissible
name, The name of a macro definition may not be blank; the cccurrence of a MOP
with a blank or any break character in column 12 will stop the assembly, A MAC
call with blank mame is permissible, and cauzes no imstructions to be inserted
into the assembled program, Thus the blank name may be considered to he re-
served for the empty macro,

All break characters other than blanks and terminal $ signs behave
exactly like commas in the range of a HOP, Consccutive break characters in a
EQOP argument string will not cause the insertion of dummy arguments with
symbol "0", but will simply be skipped.

lincro names meay not be headed, and the SAP heading character in
effect at the time of a macro definition is mot incorporated in the definition,
The heading character imn effect at the time of a macre call wiil be used on
symbols im the expanded macro, A macro which reguires = headed symbol in its
definition may be writtem so that both the heading character and symbol itself
are separately substitutable,
