Conclusion

 

The above discusslon of the Typs 705 machine is obviously ineomplete.
additional debteils are avalleble from the 702 and 705 manuals of operation.

The 705 unit employs a 6 digit parallel address and a different work structure
then the Type 702. The 705 is naturally a much faster machine «= almost 7 times
ag fast as the 702 cn reading end intépreting instructions. The arithmetic ope-
rebiong have been inoressed by o factor of 26 per cent and the total effect of these
changes is to indloate a two-fold overall increase in speedo

IBM has recently ennounced the Type 740 Cathode-Rey Output Recorder which
permits Wwiring data on the face of a Cathode=Ray tube ab the rate of 8,000 per

However,

soconde A 21" tube accurate to & per cent is used for physical inspeotion purposes
whersas a 7" tube scourabe to 01 per cent is used to automatically photogreph date
on the tubeo The Reaorder Unit is aveilable at & monthly remtal charge of $285600
The Recordep;X Unit is designed to operate with a 35 millimeter camera. Film
frames may be changed under calculator control in epproximately 650 ms per frams.

 

However, the calcoulator is actually interrupted for less than 50 ms. The time
consumed in displaying a pérticule.r point on the Cathode=Ray tume is o120 ms. A
soordinate grid of 1024 points is aveilable.

 

The IBM representatives believe the common language philosophy behind the EDPM
mechineg is one of their strongest points. This 1s true since one may convert a
fype TOL to a Typs 704 machine by merely replacing 3 units. Similarly, the Type 702
may be converted to a Type 705 by replasing 3 wnitse. .

In conclusion, IBM announced thet a EOOel.me-per-minute printer will be aval=
liable in approximately two monthse They indicated that work was, of cowrse, in
process on various paper-hendling devices, character readers, translistor computers,
higher-speed printers, eto. However, no definite statemont was made regarding a
possible delivery dete. Finally, it is rumored that the Type €650 machine will soom

be provided with magnetic tepe units and a mechenical tsbulator printer. Again, no
definite delivery date was indicated.
