Deayr Tolta:
I wouid iike to report that the psople at the Bducational Television and Radio

Caniter are very much intercsted ir comtracting with WOBH-TV and MIT for the
production of the proposed serisz on computers. In fact, I believe I am gquite

pale in saying that we need merely submit a defianite proposal; with the budget,
in order to get this contract. This would give MIT exposure, via the kinessope

recordings, on the 2L existing ETV stations as well as the 8 others that ave
scheduled to be in operation by the emd of 1957.

i de not know how I can pgseibly pat forward as strougly as I would like to our

feeling that this series should be deme. I am ssrtain that you agree with us

in car thinking about the greai importance of compuiers in eur present society.

"he confusion that exists in peoplefs minds about the nature and functiom of

competers is a result of poor and mielesading information and lack of information.

Fe feel here that iy is our responsidbility to try to do something aboat this.

We know that the people from MIT can do 2 series that will inform the public
in an organized, definitive wanney sbhout compaters. We agree that bafores we
can sctdally treat thoraughly the function and significance of these devices,
as they relate to society in general, the public mst have basic

&s o how the compufers work. My hope is thset the people at WIT will fesl
thelr responsibility for inforwing the public abeat this ares of seientific
endesvor as mich as we do,

To get domn to cases, I feel that we can make certain adjustments as to the
amount of time required from any one individnal from the MIT faculty end/or
ghelf. AV one point ws discussed having a principal person releaged fulletime
for 9 months for this serdee. I am not at all certain that this is neCessaTY
With the proper ressarch, writing and production tsam operstive, the key indie-
vicual on the series should be eble %o do this job with considerably less time
then was previcasly discussed., T want to repeat that I think it vitel that
one individual be the principal person appsaring on the series, although he
might certainly have guests on individual programe. This individual sheald be
chosen as mach frem the standpoint of personality (in temms of effective ¥V
presentation) as from the standpoint of his knowledge and ebility im the £isld.
