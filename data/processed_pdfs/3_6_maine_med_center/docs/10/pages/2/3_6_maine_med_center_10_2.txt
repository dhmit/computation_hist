waere n is a unit normal vector, and /5 is an element of surface. The theory

holds for a volume of any shape, but simplifications can sometimes be obtained if

a geometrical figure is used. For the human body, if we assume that the trunk has
the shape of a right cylinder of elliptical or any other cross-section, then Mx
and My are given by integrations over the walls only, and Mz by an integration over

the top and bottom surfaces. We have then

M= A SV dy d2 = d JfV ot b2 (2)
My ok JJV e d2 = A )V & LA (3/

So far we are unable to find Mz by this method, since the head and legs
are poor approximations to parallel plane surfaces. In order to determine Mz with
MX and My given, it is only necessary to find the vertical angle of the vector, and

this can be found approximately by means of Kinthoven's equation or by some similar

vector method.

For a cylinder, equation (2) can be evaluated by measuring the potential
distribution around the cylinder at a given horizontal level. 6 is the angle between
the normal to the surface and the +X axis. The integral of V ces @ /¢ is evaluated
for a number of horizontal levels and these values are plotted against 2 The
area under this curve is tne required double integral, nb is found from eq. (3)
