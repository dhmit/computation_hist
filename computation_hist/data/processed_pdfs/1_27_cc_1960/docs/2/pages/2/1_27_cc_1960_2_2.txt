but its expansion will be hampered by the limitations of access
to the 7oﬂy as will be discussed later.

The use of the machine by the other colleges has expanded
rapidly until nearly a full shift is now occupied with their work
(including their class exercises). But this use tends to be selfa
limiting for, as soon as a college faculty begins fully to apprec-
iate the possibilities in education and research or computers, the

of their own° These are smaller machines,9 of the 650 type, (with
some larger machines projected), so these institutions still come
to the Center to use the 70b for their bigger‘Jobs; but it does
mean that the use of the Center by the other New.England colleges
will tend to level off to a reasonable load (about one shift, it
now appears) rather than growing continuously, as the‘MIT usage is
doing. This result, of course, is in accord with our conviction
that computers should be as prevalent as chemistry laboratories,

depend completely on machine computation and could already use more
time than we can allot them, there are a number of research projects
which are basic to the development of new uses for computers, and,
indeed, to the development of computers themselves, which are already
handicapped by shortage of machine time and limitation of 70%
capacitieso To mention a few:

Pro rammin Develo ment. The Center staff has already
developEdﬂan automatic operator routine which is being adopted by
other 70% userso More general assembly programs; such as the
Linking Segment Subprogram Loaderﬁ which combines Fortran, SAP atd
other special codes; GOMITE which enables the 704 to be used on
language translation problems; and LISPE which enables the machine
to handle nonenumerical logicg such as algebraic and other symbolic
manipulationg are being developed and tested. The work at MIT in
this fieldg since Whirlwind daysg is well known°

Zimeasharing Techni ues° We already have a typewriter
connects to t e l a which works on a timeosharing basis with our

same time that‘regular computations are being carried out on other
problemsﬂ for exampleo The 704 cannot effectively accommodate more
than one or two such satelite channelsg but the Center staff is now
