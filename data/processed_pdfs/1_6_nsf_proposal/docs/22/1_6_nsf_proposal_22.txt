Title of Proposed Research: Research on Digital Computer Operation
ne and Utilization--Investigation into

the patterns of operation of electronic digital computers and the
methods whereby they can be used in mathematical and experimental
research; including studies of numerical analysis and machine pro-
gramming methods, Investigation of the possibilities of the complete
mechanization of the sequence of recording, processing, analysis
and presentation of experimental data and the working out of such
specific applications of machine techniques to problems in science,
engineering, and administration as will elarify the basic research
and suggest new points of view.

Desired Starting Date: July 1, 1956

Time Period: Three years, with a reassessment during the fall of
1050 To determine whether further support is advisable.

Proposed Research; Background Information: We are organizing what

should be one of the most fruitful centers for research related to

the use of electronic computers in this country. IBM is contributing

one of its 704 machinés, maintained and equipped with appropriate

auxiliary equipment. IBM and MIT are providing the building, part

of the new Compton Laboratory, and MIT is contributing some of the

staff from its departments of mathematics, electrical engineering,

physles, and Industrial management. The machine will be available,

35 or more hours a week, free of machine time charge, toc MIT staff

and students for non-classified and non-routine research. MIT

research in the Center will be coordinated by the Institute Machine |
Computation Committee (see Appendix A for names). |

In addition, the Center will be available, up tc 35 hours
a week, on the same basis, to other colleges in New England. Already
23 institutions have indicated their interest in participating and
have appointed faculty members to be their Institutional Representa-
tive (list of participating colleges and representatives given in
Appendix A). These representatives will coordinate the research
done on the machine by students and staff of their institution.
IBM is providing some funds for stipends for graduate students who
wish to learn machine use by helping with some of this research.

In this atmosphere and with these facilities, there 1s an
unparalleled opportunity to do important and basic research in all
phases of the use of digital computers in science, engineering,
and business. A central research group, supervised by faculty |
members and staffed by workers picked from the graduate students |
of MIT and other colleges, working closely with persons from the i
other colleges, will help coordinate the work of the Center and |
will carry on research of thelr own in machine logic, in techniques
of machine computation, and in specific applications of machine


iD

operation to experimental and theoretical problems, thus appreciably
broadening the range of applicability of computers in the physical
and social sciences and in engineering.

It is appropriate for government agencies to help support
the research of this central research group. The group's work will,
in part, provide an expanding basis of knowledge of numerical
analysis and programming techniques, which can be used by the other
participants at the Center and will, in part, break ground in new
fields of mathematical logic and methods of data processing which
will be needed in the application of digital computers to new tasks.

Most of the senior staff for such a research group 1s
already assembled at the Institute. Part of it is the group which
developed Whirlwind I programming; others are in various departments
of the Institute. From time to time, some of the staff of the
participating colleges would Join it for a semester or a year, on
leave from their institution, to work full-time at the Center.

IBM and the Institute will contribute about a half million
dollars a year to provide the equipment, bullding, maintenance, and
operating staff of the Center. Ve believe that a contribution of
about 100,000 a year will support the activities of the central
research group, which will energize and take the lead in the re-
search carried on at the Computation Center by students and staff
of MIT and the particlpating colleges. We list later in this
proposal some of the specific research projects we are prepared to
start on. Other projects will develop naturally from these and
from the problems encountered by the other workers at the Computation
Center.

The project would not start at full strength. The 704 willl
not be installed until January or February 1957, though analytic
work can be started before the machine is installed. The present
Whirlwind computing research group can be supported by the present
ONR contract until December 1956, but a few new staff members must
be brought in in September in order to get ready for the new machine
installation. Ve estimate that a total budget of 200,000 would
suffice for the next academic year, F00,000 for 1957 58 and $100,000
for 1958-59. Details are given later in this proposal. At the
beginning of 1959 the program should be re-evaluated to determine
needs beyond that time.

After conversations with the scientific directors and
division chiefs of ONR and NSF, we are requesting financial support
frem both agencleg, ar equal ahare from each, We believe the work

can be divided so that separate contracts can be written. Some of
the proposed taske would be differ rent, though some of Che broader
Yields of investig ticn would overlap. We would hope that we could


-h-

put out a combined progress report. In some published papers,
credit could be given to one organization alone; in others, credit
would go to both. Bookkeeping would be somewhat more complicated,
but since most of the expense would be for salaries, little for
permanent equipment, this could be done. It probably would be
necessary to have the usual government overhead for both contracts.

The proposed budget asked of each agency for 1956-57 is
given below. The corresponding amounts for the following two years
would be g45,000 for 1957-58 and g50,000 for 1958-59, as indicated
above,

Proposed Research; Possible Initial Directions of Investigation:

1. Investigation of Structure and Syntax of input
languages; the possibilities of coding directly in mathematical,
logical or business language.

2. Development of routines capable of translating from
algebraic notation to computer code and vice versa, Including
possibly automatic selection of numerical techniques and automatic
error analysis. ~

5. Development of numerical analytic techniques particu-
larly suitable for use by digital computers: such as more general
expansions, truncated Chebyshev polynomials sums for simulating
standard functions by a common block of instructions but small
separate blocks of coefficients and cycle counters and methods of
automatic determination of best grid spacing, by trial plus
Richardson extrapolation or other means.

4, Investigation of Monte Carlo techniques for large
problems.

| 5. Extension and/or improvement of present techniques
for communication between machine and operator and for the wore
flexible control of machine operation, including possible improve-
ments in input-output equipment.

Coding of Tarski's decision method for elementary
algebra and geometry. Tarski has shown that ele-
mentary algebra and geometry can be declded by a
computer. To implement this would be a task of
considerable magnitude, but it would illustrate the
logical capabilities of a computer to a degree not
heretofore done.

He

Facilities: The MIT Computation Center will have a Type TOU
Electronic Data Processing Machine with the following machine
complement: 12 magnetic tape units, 2 magnetic CORE storage units
containing a total of 8,000 words, 1 magnetic drum unit containing
4,000 words of storage, the usual on-line punched card reader,
alphabetic printer, and punched card recorder as well as the 5
off-line magnetic tape controlled printer, magnetic tape controlled
card punch, and punched card-to-magnetlc tape converter, respectively.
In addition to the 704, there will be 10 auxiliary punched card
machines including card punches, collators, sorters, reproducers,
interpreters, and the Type 407 Accounting Machine. The aggregate
ay rental, in excess of $50,000 per month, will be donated by

' The Type TO4% EDPM unit is one of the fastest large-scale
commercial computers available today. Since the MIT installation
will be but one of many in the field, techniques, programs, and =
numerical procedures developed for this wachilne will be of use to
others having access to 704 equipment.

Since the staff will pe acquired in 1956, some of them
being transferred from oth

er projects between July and December
1956, expenditures for the

first year 1956-1957 will be about
3/% of the above yearly estimate.” 60,000.

One half of this contributed by ONR £30,000
Requested for year beginning July 1, 1956.

Note on Overhead: The overhead percentage is based on previous

experience, t may differ Somewhat from this when charges are
computed,
