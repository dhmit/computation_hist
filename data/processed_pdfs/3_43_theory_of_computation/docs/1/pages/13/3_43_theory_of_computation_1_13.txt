are defined recursively,” a difficulty arlses
For example, consider factorial defined by
factorial(n) = (n Q= 1o~ Iactor al(n-l))
The expression =il
2((n),(n:0-">1,T-ﬂ~n-factorial(n—l)))
camnot serve as a name for this function because
it is not clear that the occurrence of "factorial
in the expression refers to the function defined
by the expression as a whole. Therefore, for
recursive functions we adopt an additional con-
vention, Nanely,
label(f, 3 ((x;,«++X ),e))

stands for the function f defined by the
equation

f(xl,...xn)

»

where any occurrences of the function letter I
‘within e stand for the function being defined.
The letter £ also serves as a dummy variable,
The factorial function then has the name
label(factorial, A((n), (n=0 - 1,T ~» n*
factorial(n-1))))
and since factorial and n are dummy variables

the expression '

1abOl(G, A ((1‘) ) (1‘:0 25 13T = r'g(r"l))))
represents the same function.

If we start with a base domain for our
variables, it is possible to consider a hierarchy
of functionals., At level 1 we have functions
whose arguments are in the base domain, At

“'e shall consider several successive ex-
tensions of the class C '7D « First we adjoin
the universal quantlllel‘v to the operations uscd ,
to define new functions. Suppose e is a form |

with the space T of truth values. Then |
V((x),e) ' |
is a new form in the remaining variables also
associated with 1. W/((x) e) has the value T ;
for given values of the remaining variables if : |
for all values of X, e has the value T. ' : '
\f((x) e) has the val F 1if for at least one
value of X, e has the value F. In the

the value T and for all others e is undeflned
YV ((x),e) is undefined,.
If we allow the use of the universal
quantifier to form new propositional forms for
use in conditional forms, we get a class of func-
tions Ila f‘?j which may well be called the class
of functions h/per-arlthmetlc over 7- since in F
