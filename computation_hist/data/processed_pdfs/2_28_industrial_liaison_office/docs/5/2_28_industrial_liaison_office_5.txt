Room 26-142

Dear Professor Morse:

Shortly we must publish an announcement of the Fall Series
of Industrial Liaison Symposia. Each symposium is described in
a paragraph about the material to be presented and about the
level of comprehension expected of those who attend. These
paragraphs average ten lines in length. I have enclosed the
last announcement for illustration.

If it is convenient I would like to meet with you during
the week of August llth to prepare this paragraph for the Com-
putation symposium which we discussed in our last meeting. We
would like to have these paragraphs completed by August 15th
and hope that this will be possible.

ir, fo Yonclle 1.

Industrial Liaison Officer
