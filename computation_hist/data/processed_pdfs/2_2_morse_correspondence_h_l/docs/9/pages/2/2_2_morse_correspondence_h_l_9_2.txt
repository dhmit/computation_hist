Professor Korgen will leave for Denmark in Jamry to lecture there for
a semester on Operations Research and Linear Programming. He plans
to visit the MIT Computation Center some time this fall to find out what
has been and is being done in thh field.

Last year a seminar on the 704 was held by Professor Chittim and
Professor Lacosce. This year a Computation Library will be set up in
Room 109 of the mathematics classroom building.

No one at Bowdoin has any concrete plans for writing a program and
making use of the Computation Center at present. It is probably that
during the course of the year, one or two faculty members may decide
to avail themselves of the facilities of the Center. Since the school has
no graduate program, Professor Korgen and Chittim did not believe that
students would make use of the Center.

Professor Korgen reported that about $150 remained in the travel fund
allocated to Bowdoin last year. He requested that it be made available
for use this year. Various faculty members plan to visit the Center and
attend seminars here this year.
