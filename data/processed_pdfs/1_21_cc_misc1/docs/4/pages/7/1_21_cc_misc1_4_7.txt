Comparison of certain common adjectives (bonus, melior, optimus)
and of corresponding adverbs, Even among comparatively regularly
inflected parts of Speech alphabetic sorting by entire words will do
violence to conventional paradigmatic order: reference to such a
common verb as amare will bear this out,

Beyond these lexical peculiarities are to be found matters of
a higher order of complexity. Many of Calvin's sentences are long
and hierarchically organized; clauses are often interlaced in such a
way that the printing of the near context will not reveal the most im-
portant aspects of a particular construction,

Finally, Latin does not possess a uniform orthography, The
Barth-Niesel edition of the Institutes and the Corpus Reformatorum
edition of Calvin's other works pose little problem here, but com-
parative studies with other authors will be affected by these variant
spellings, e, g., aeloe, ilj, alv, ct/th, etc. If, at a later stage, a
concordance to Calvin's French-language writings is decided upon,
Some conventions with regard to orthography will have to be worked
out,

 

Certain arbitrary decisions are here proposed to meet these
problems of alphabetization:

(1) The irregular principal parts of certain verbs (as
well as of adjectives, etc. ) will be separately en-
tered at their normal alphabetic position;

l. The following conventions will be observed in key-punching
the Barth-Niesel text: a) all material within square brackets in the
text will be omitted, being replaced by a sign of omission; b) all
superscripts (letters and numbers) will be disregarded; also all
parallel lines and marginalia; c) all capitalization will be disre-
garded; d) all footnotes will be disregarded; e) all non-Latin words
will be Romanized as pre-edited; f) all words divided between ends
of line and beginning of next will be carried undivided on first of
two lines--except when by so doing there is not enough space in
the first line, in which case the divided word will be typed undivided
in the second of the two lines; g) all punctuation will be separated

from previous word by no space at all, but from the following by a
space,
