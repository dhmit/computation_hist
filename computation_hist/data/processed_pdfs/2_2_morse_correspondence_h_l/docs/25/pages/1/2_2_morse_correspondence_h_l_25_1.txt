Dear Dr. Morse:

I am writing to you at the suggestion of Dr. John W, Carr III,
my colleague in the field of Engineering Mathematics. He is a
consultant and technical adviser in a project, which is under
my direction and which I shall explain briefly.

About six months ago our Graduate School made me a small
grant to prepare materials for a Concordance of the Works of
Cervantes, the famous Spanish literary figure. In this project
I plan to make use of an electronic computer in order to assemble
and classify the data in a minimum of time. We have up to now
made our plans for preparation of punch cards and considered
the problems of programming.

 

My purpose in writing to you is to ask whether there would
be any possibility of using "free" time on the computer under
your direction, either at night or on week-ends when the equip-
ment is not being used. Our project has meagre funds which
barely cover the punch card operation and the programming cost.
Standard charges for computer use are, of course, far beyond
our possibilities. The project offers an excellent opportunity
for experiment in the application and use of electronic computing
processes to linguistic and literary materials. As such it has
the support of the Humanities Divisional Research Committee of
our Graduste School, of the University Committee on the Linguistics
Program, and of various departments of the College of Literature,
Science and the Arts.

I hope to hear from you at your convenience concerning
your answer and reactions to my query.

Sincerely,

o

Lawrence B. Kiddle
Professor of Spanish
