Dear Dr. Morse:

I am most appreciative of your invitation to spend the
coming academic year at MIT and of Jerrold Zacharias' thought-
fulness in suggesting it. I would like to spend the year there not
only because it would be very profitable to me personally, but
because of the benefit to IBM (and I think to MIT) from closer
relations on the scientific level. IBM management is very pleased
with your proposal and has given me every assistance in trying to
arrange for a year's absence.

Unfortunately, the present year finds me with an unusual
number of commitments, After most careful consideration, I
feel that I must decline. I do this with great regret and with the
hope that the invitation might someday be repeated.

Sincerely yours,

palace Ese)
