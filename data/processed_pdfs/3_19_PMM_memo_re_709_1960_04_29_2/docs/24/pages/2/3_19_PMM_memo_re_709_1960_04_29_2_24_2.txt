- Also, thoro is a nature (i.o. vail-vomkod ovor)
set of progralning systens avtilable.

From a personal point o! view, I conaider thic lalt point to bo
the most inportant and overriding one at this tine.:.ln particular,.thej
709 and 7090 machines have the qnito useful and oaay-to-vork-vith For-
tran-Fap lonitor Systenm which allows efticient and convenient utilization
of the computer by programmers who are not apeciaiistc in machine language. G
Fortran and FAP tranllatora are both_nvailablo and further transtatora
have been prepared by such groups as the Univorsity of Machigan (the -MAD
Translator) and others. In our own case, I would estimate that our effec-

. tive utilization of the 709 has almost doubled that of the previous 704 ,
that we had, This is primarily due to the smoothness of the 709 operating
‘systems, We also have seen a vary largo increase in the ‘pumber of users
of our Center, which 1 feel also substuntiate the relative ease with which
\ casual programmers can use the computer ottcctively. (The Center preaently
has over 500 active users in any nonth). 3. MRy f: ;

_ The abovo conaiderations are, l !eol the naJor ones that I would
- o make concerning the advisability of a 7090 system. I hope they are of

some asaistanco to you‘in forming your Judgnents and I will be glad to
discusa any of the above topica at greater length ir you wish, |
