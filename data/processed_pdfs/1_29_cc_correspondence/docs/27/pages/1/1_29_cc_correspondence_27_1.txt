. : =

The Computation Center plans to imtroduce the recent IBM revisions
and extensions to the Fortran-FAP Momitor System om April 3, 1961, The
revisions provide a faster operating system; both Fortran compilation and
BSS loading time have been significantly decreassed, The oxtensions imnelude
the additional control ecard opticns such as LABEL and LISTR deserided im the
slightly revised Refersnce Manwal T09/7090 Fortran Programming System (C28-
6054-2). These chenges are extensive and must be made compatible with our
existing system. | |

Because these revisions require changes in present prograwning
practices, the Center is delaying the imclusion of thew in the Systew wmtil
the cbove date. These changes are:;

1, All gymbolie subprogran decks within a Job or chaim link must
precede all the bimary subprogram decks for that Jjobb or chaim limk., No
H llerith cards may appear in a deck between the first bimary card and the
CHAIN or DATA card. '

2, The faster BES loading program does not allow execution to
take place if the program loaded (exclusive of COMMON) overlaps the loader
and its8 tables, Thus a few Jobs charscterized by a large umount of program
and little COMMON which run under the present system, may not rum im the

3, The Chain tapes have been changed internally to Ad, B2, and
B3. Thua A4 (logical 8) is the recoumended chain tape amd may not be wsed
as a scratch tape for chaim Jobs; Bl can be used instead. 8@mmé§_1nmgm&g@
Compatibility is maintained though, 1i.e., the statement

CALL CHAIN (REC,B1)
will compile im such a way that physical tape Ad is used instead of B1
4. The DATE control card will be ignored and treated as a COMmEnt

if used, Im the MIT system, the date on which a job is rum will atomatically
appear on the page neading .
