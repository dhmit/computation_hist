Dear Dr. Knowles:

I am pleased to enclose a check for $1, 250. 00 for the second
semester portion of the Northeastern University appointment to the M.I.T.
Computation Center as described on the attached sheet. The IBEM
Corporation is very grateful for the work of the Research Associates and

Assistants in the program for they have contributed a great deal to its
success. |

There are now thirty-four colleges and universities in New
England participating with M.I.T. in the Computation Center. The new
IBM 709 has been in operation for four months, and already seventeen of
the colleges have made use of it. For your information, I am enclosing
a table of usage for the months September - December, 1960.

We are delighted that the M.1.T. Center has been able to
supplement your own very excellent Center, and we are looking forward
to the growth of your educational program in the computing field as you
change from an IBM 650 to an IBM 1620.

Sincerely yours,

M. Loren Bullock
University Representative
