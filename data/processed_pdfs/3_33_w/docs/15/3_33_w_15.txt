Dear Phil:

This is to confirm our conversation concern=-
ing the use of punched paper tape in handling experimental data, and
the possibility of subsequently using such tape with the 70h. It seems
clear that paper tape is the cheapest and most convenient way to record
high-cutput experiments. In fact, the Nuclear Lab already has one such
arrangement in operation at the linear accelerator. The Cosmic Ray
Group is now in the process of buying a "Commercial Controls" tape puncher
to use with its large monitor. As you know, with the help of Dr. E. M.
Piore we were able to obtain good delivery time on an IBM key punch type
026 and are now modifying this to accept the output from a data analyzer,
However, in general this type of application could be handled more con-
veniently, I am sure, by punched tape. I therefore should like to add
my voice to those who are recommending that the Computation Center provide
itself with a facility for handling paper tape,
