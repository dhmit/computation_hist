brought to the Center.
The Importance of Team Research

" But an instrumentality, by itself, cannot produce new
research. To make the important advances, which are possible
with a computer of the speed and flexibility of this, one needs a
team of research people, some of whom know the machine and some
of whom know the research field. To get exciting new possibilities
beyond the stage of a "gleam in the eye" we need, in addition to
the machine, a staff of experts in machine use, ready to team up
with those scientists who believe the machine can help them but
are not sure how, so that, between them, they can translate the
"gleam inthe eye" into new and important results.

In the long run, the various social scientists in New

England will probably learn enough about machine operation to be
able to make the machine useful to them. But it takes time fto
learn to program a machine of this size, and research workers in
any fleld are reluctant to take much time off to learn new tech-
nigues. In addition, to get the most out of a computer, one
should have more than a casual knowledge of the electronic details
of its operation. This comblnation of knowledge, of a social

sclence and of a computer, will probably be developed in our next
