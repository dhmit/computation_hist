~have to limit their actual contact with machines to one or two

hours of .demonstration per term, whereas they could and should ex-

pand this time enough 3o each student has a chanee to participate

- 1In the operation, so he can actually get a "feel" for the process.

. Such an expansion of contact hours is impossible at present; with

careful scheduling it could be accomplished with an appropriately
located 704, with adequate space and auxiliary equipment. Even
with the courses listed above, it could easily grow to 3000-4000
student contact-hours per term.

As soon as more equipment 1s avallable, more courses in
business data handling can be initiated and the course in operations
research can be expanded. Probably other courses, incsubjectsinot
yet envisaged, will also be made possible.

Plan8 are now being made to expand our research program 1in
operatiops research, in systems engineering and in the quantitative
analysis of industrial and governmental operation. Funds willl be
sought to inerease the number of zssistantships and fellowships
which can be granted for research in these flelds, so that we can
compete with other filelds for the good students. None of these
plans could be implemented unless we are sure we will have the
best computing equipment, adequately housed and appropriately
staffed.
