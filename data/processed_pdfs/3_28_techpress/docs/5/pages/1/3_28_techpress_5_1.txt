Memorandum to: Dr. F. M., Verzuh October 11, 1957

From: F. J. Corbatd

We need to clarify the cost picture in terms of the transfer
of 704 notes to Tech Press. In particular, Mr, Bryant at Tech Press estimates
a cost from $800 to $1,000 to reproduce those portions of the current notes
and included material which are either short or missing to make a quantity
of 450 complete sets of notes. If the current stock were given to Tech
Press at no charge and Tech Press were to make no other payments to the
Center but would pay for the reproducing of the necessary material, this
would make the cost per set of notes four to five dollars for 300 copies
(the assumption here is that the Center would receive 150 copies back free
for internal distribution).

After some discussion it came out that the best arrangement in
reducing cost to all concerned was to aim at 525 complete copies instead of
450 (this means reproducing a little bit extra) of which Tech Press would
pay all reproduction costs necessary to make them complete, The Center would
turn over the entire stock of its present material, and after assembly of
525 copies the Center would draw back exactly what it needed.

Consequently, if this is to go through the two questions to be
answered are:

1. How much will Tech Press pay the Center for the notes
that it receives, and
2. how many free copies of the 525 is the Center to receive?

A possible third question is: does Tech Press pay back to the Center any
percentage of the money collected from sale of the notes?
