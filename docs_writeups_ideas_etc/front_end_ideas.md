#Possiblities for Front End

This markdown file will detail the ideas for integrating 1950s-60s
design into the website.

Including pictures of MIT back in the 1950s
might help give site viewers a sense of the environment
that surrounded the development of computation at MIT. This can
be complemented using a very simple aesthetic design, so as not
to take away from the beauty of the images being
portrayed. Images like these can be placed on the header of the website, or 
possibly on the very front page. An assortment of photos from this time 
period can be displayed on the front page, such that the fist thing that
the reader sees is the setting where our archives come from. 

To be more specific, we can accrue an assortment of about
10 or so pictures, and the front page can oscillate between these images
periodically. Doing this, along with a simple and 
intuitive design, will allow for a website that feels innately 
modern with very detailed and intricate elements from the past.
This symbolizes the very goal of this Computation History Project,
as we are trying to bridge past events at MIT to now
using computation and modernized technology.
