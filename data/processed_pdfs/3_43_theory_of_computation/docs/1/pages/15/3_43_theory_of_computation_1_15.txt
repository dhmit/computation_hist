JThere are a number &F important kinds of
mathematical argunents whose convenient formaliza-
gigpmmaywinyolvc a@biguous functionstilin,orQOr to
give an example, we nced two definitions., If f
and g are two ambiguous functions, we shall sd§
that f is a descendant of g 1T for o

possible value of f(x) is also a possible value of

Secondly, we shall say that a property of
ambiguous functions is hereditary if whenever it
is possessed by a function g it is also possessed
by all descendants of g. The property that itera-
tion of an integer valued function eventually
gives O is hereditary and the function less has
this property. 50, therefore, do all its
descendants., Thus any function, however, com-
plicated which always reduces a number will if
iterated sufficiently always give 0,

This example is one of our reasons for hoping

that ambiguous functions will turn out to be
