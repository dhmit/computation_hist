X hours, were allocated y hours according to the following rules,

 

 

 

and actually used z hours. A detailed accounting of your de-
partmental use of the TO4 is enclosed.

ted w hours. Unless we hear from you. proposing a different
scheme we will divide it between applicants from your depart-
ment according to the following scheme:

1. 80 per cent allocated at beginning of quarter. 10
per cent for new requests during quarter. 10 per cent for sup-
plementary requests during quarters.

2. Priorities will be assigned in the following order

1. Class use
2. Bachelor's theses
3. MS. theses
Â« Ph. D. theses
5. Research projects

3. Should you prefer to allocate the time yourselves,
or would like us to use a different system we will be happy to
oblige.

The advantage of departmental quotas is twofold:

1. The decisions as to which uses are most effective in
research or in education are put in the hands of those who know
the prospective users best.

2. It makes all department heads and their associates
aware of the pressure on the computer and will make them more
receptive to any efforts proposed to expand the facility.

4. Improved Programming by Users. Users can get more per
machine hour if Chey program better. The Center can help them
progrgm better by

l. Better descriptions of the programming systems and
procedures. This is a staff problem. A 5 page propaganda -l
booklet may help.

2. Better accounting. The users do not know how much
tlme they use on runs and big users can't discriminate between
thelr programmers. The obsolete Y407 accounting procedure should
be replaced by a 704 program. Programmers responsible for prob-
lems should get biweekly summaries listing each run made, time
used, programmer submitting it. The machine and staff time re-
quired should not be excessive.
