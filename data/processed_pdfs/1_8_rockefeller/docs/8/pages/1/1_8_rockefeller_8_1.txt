Dear Mr. Cobb:

Way back in February you wrote me asking when
i1t would be possible for you to obtain photographs of
our new Computation Center. I have been delaying answer-
ing you, hoping to give you a definite answer and perhaps
some photographs, but there have been delays in building
construction and the Center is not quite completed yet.
It would be much more preferable, from our point of view,
to wait until the installation is complete, when we will
wish to take photographs for other reasons in addition
to getting them for you.

I hope that we can make Cthese photographs some
time in June and that this will not be too late for your
purposes.

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse
Director
