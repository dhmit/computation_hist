TRIP REFORT

Place Visited: The IBM Type 705 EDPM Exscutive Course, Endicott, No Yo
Date of Trips Period covering November 15-19, 1954
Visited bys Dro. Fo Mo Verszuh

1.0 Introduction

The purpose of this course was to acquaint executives with the capabilities
of the recently=anncunced Type 705 Electronic Data Froeessing Machine. The 708
is actually en improved version of the former Type 702 EDFM unit, The principal
distinction between the two machines is thet the 708 machine has 20,000 decimal
digits of magnetic care memory with an attendent access time of .0l7 milliseconds
for a Secharacter word of instruction. In addition, some 16 accumulators are
available which replace the former A end B sccumulators. A number of engineering

modifications have been made «= all of which tend to increase the operating speed
of the 706 machine.

Verying amounts of Gime were devoted so ensh of these 1ltemsSe Generally speaking,
three hours were devoted to cach item. Aun IBM pre liminary manuel of information
on the 706 (Form 09.6827=0) is available which desoribes the principal differences
between the 705 and the former 702 machined

Components of the Type 706 Machine

The peripheral equipment such as magnetic tape unlis, ‘magnetic drums, card
readers, card punch end card printers are identical to those employed on the
Type 702 machine, the only distinection being that the 700 unit employs suitable
control units to convert data coming from the main frame to that used on the
gtandard peripheral equipmente As previously mentioned, the magnetic core memories
replace the former cathode-ray tube storage which is used on the 702, Tha cores
are arranged to provide repdom acesss of any 9 sharacter instruction in 0 O17
milliseconds. (It is to be recalled that 0.023 milliseconds were required on the
702 machina) Astually a 27-bit code is used to represent each character and access
nede in the usual parallel mannere

A verieble record length 1s used on all units of the machine. 4s a result,
a greater packing density is achieved on 211 storage media == megnotic tapes, drums,
and core s8GOragse The speed of operation has paburel ly been increased and the
following aritimetic operations are renlized using a 5 declmal-diglt number $

Addition = 504,000 operations per minute
liultiplication = 76,000 operations per minute
Division = 33,000 operations per minute
Comparison = 1,784,000 operations per minute

Furthermore, the machine is designed to permit transfer from one section of the
core memory to another section without recourse to the erithmetic elemento

Magnetic Tape Units

is recorded on the taps at a density of 200 characters per inch, and a tape speed
of 75 inches per second ig used formading and writing. The start tims is 10
milliseconds. A gap of 0.75 inches is used to separate records on taps. For exe
ample, an 80-column IBM card mey be recorded on Oe.4l inches end this is followed by
a gap of 0.70 inches, etc. However, the inter=card gap may be eliminated by means
of record marks. |

A redundengsy oheck is used on the megnetic tape in which both a vertical and
longitudinal check digit are usede That 1s, a 6=bit code 1s used to represent a
charecter and a 7th bit is used an an even oount checke A tepe synchronizer is
evaileble which handles as many as 10 megnetic tape units.

Sarting on the Type 706 machins utilizes 4 magnetic tape units as well as
the ecoumulator and as such, is 50 per cent faster as it was on the Type 702 machine.
In the particular method of sorting used, the worst possible case is that involving
data which exists in complete descending order. The following formula relates the
number of pairs of tape units (T) and the number of passes required (P):

7 2S Rr (number of records)

For example, if 8 records were involved and only 2 pairs of tape units were used,
3 passes would be required, |

The usual precaution must be taken in hendling the magnetic tape units. That
is, the tape has a certain dimensional instability in so far as humidity and tem
perature are oonssrnede Specifically, it is recommended that the megnetic tape
units be operated in.e humidity range of 40 to 60 per cent and in a temperature
not exceeding 80%F.. ..

Magnetic Drum

The magnetic drum on the Type 705 is approximately 10" in diameter in contrast
to the 4" drum used on the Type 650 Drum Caloulator. The drum material on both
machines is the same3 namely, a drum plating consisting of 80 per cent cobalt ==
20 per cent nickel is usede The design of the read-write heads is almost identical,
although the 700 head has a few more turns of wire.

The drum is capable of storing 60,000 characters. A variable record size is
employed which admits use of some 300 addresses. Table look-up has been accelerated
on the Type 705 because of the b=character address which is employed,

Operation Tims of Maghine Components

 

The previously-mentioned manual on 705 provides the exact {formulae which
relate the operation time of each component in terms of number of records involved.
Generally speaking, the card punch is the slowest unit on the machine whereas the
magnetic drum unit is the fasteste The following tebulation indloates the
approximate times ¢

Card punch walt = G00 ms
Card printing walt «= 400 ms
Card reading wnit = 240 ns
Magnetic tape unit = 15036 ms
Magnetic drum = 11,20 ms

I have intimated that seversl control units must be utilized to convert from the
mechanical to the electronic units. Specifically, a control unit is required to
convert from the card reader to the magnetic cores. Similarly, a different control
unit is reguired to convert fram the memory %o the card printer. Finally, a third
control unit is required to convert from the memary to the card punch.

The uss of control units is intended to provide a common language bond on all
types of IBM EDPM machines. For example, the peripheral equipment on the Type 701,
702, 704, end 705 mechines is identical. It iz merely necessary to use a different
type of control unit on certain machines, IBM considers this common language of
gomputer development to be a most important pert of their computer development program

Machine Instructions

The Type 700 machine employs a 5 decimal digit number to represent instructions
a8 well as addresses. This permits the machine to modify both addresses and instru-
ctiong during the solution of a particular probleme. This is an important charace
teristic of any computer. More importent, however, is the fact that the magnetic
cores permit random access to the entire instruction (5 decimal digit) in e com=
pletely random=accoss manners It is $his feature that is responsible for. the
great increase in operation spesd on the 700.

Appli cations

Section 200 contains a list of the case studies which were discussed in this
course. Since there are memoranda available desoribing each of these in considerad
detail, it is not necessary to discuss them further at this point. However, a fow
remarks on the payroll problem are in orders The Type 660 Drum Calculator was
discussed and demonstrated using e typloal payroll problem consisting of 6,000
personnel, 40 departments each containing a maximum of 200 men, and 100 jobs in
process within each departmente This problem was set up using € different input
cards and 3 output cards == current earning card, nsweyeareio=date card, aud a
job lgborecogt card. Markesensing was used on atiendance cards and the checks were
automatically prepared on the Type 407 Accounting Machine. The entire 6,000-man
payroll required a total elapsed time of 11 hours. It is, of course, to be remembered
that & mumber of machines are operating in parsllel at certain times since 10 hours
of 650 Caloulator time were required,

It must be remembered that an excise tax of at least 10 per cent must be applied
to the gbove items. Furthermore, it must be recelled that at least 8 magnetic tape
units would be required oa such an installation. Hence a minimum ingtallation would
probably cost about $34,000 per month (A recommended area of 1650 sq. ft. and an
associated control engineers room of 400 sg. ft. is required.)


Conclusion

 

The above discussion of the Types 705 machine is obviously incomplete.
additional debeils are avalleble from the 702 and 705 manuals of operation.
The 705 unit employs a 6 digit parallel address and a different work structure
then the Type 702. The 705 is naturally a much faster machine -- almost 7 times
as fest as the 702 cn reading end intepreting instructions. The arithmetic ope-
rabiong have been increased by a factor of 26 per cent and the total effect of these
changes is to indloate a two-fold overall increase in speedo

However,

IBM has recently ennounced the Type 740 Cathode-Rey Output Recorde¥ which
permits Wiring data on the face of a Cathode=Ray tube ab the rate of 8,000 per
soconde A 21" tube accurate to 3 per cent is used for physical inspection purposes
whereas a 7" tube scourabe to 01 per cent is used to automatically photograph date
on the tube. The Reaorder Unit is available at a monthly rental charge of $2850,

The Recorded Unit is designed to operate with a 35 millimeter camera. Film
framss may be changed under calculator control in aspproximately 50 ms per frams.

 

However, the calculator is actually interrupted for less than 50 ms. The time
consumed in displaying a particular point on the Cathode=Ray tume is «120 ms. A
coordinate grid of 1024 points is available.

 

The IBM representatives believe the common language philosophy behind the EDPM
mechines is one of their strongest points. This 1s true since one may convert a

Type 701 to a Types 704 machine by merely replacing 3 unitse Similarly, the Type 702
may be converted to a Type 705 by replasing 3 wnitse .

In conclusion, IBM announced thet a 500<-11ine=per-minute printer will be avale
liable in approximately two monthee They indicated that work was, of cowrse, in
process on various paper-hendling devices, character readers, transistor computers,
higher-speed printers, sto. However, no definite statement was made regarding a
possible delivery dete. Finally, it is rumored that the Type 650 machine will soom

be provided with magnetic tepe units and a mechanical tsbulator printer. Again, no
definite delivery date was indicated.
