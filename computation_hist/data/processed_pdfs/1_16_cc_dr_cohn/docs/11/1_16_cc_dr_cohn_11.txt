THE DENSITY OF ABELIAN CUBIC FIELDS
HARVEY com:l

In the following note we show that the abelian cubic ﬁelds are rare
in relation to all cubic ﬁelds over the rationals. This is no surprise
since an irreducible cubic equation generates an abelian ﬁeld if and
only if the coefﬁcients of the equation are subject to a certain restric—
tion (that the discriminant of the equation be a perfect square). To
express this rareness in analytic form we arrange the ﬁelds in order
of increasing ﬁeld—discriminant and we deﬁne

NA(x) =number of abelian cubic ﬁelds of (positive) discriminant
éx, and

N(x)=number of (abelian and non-abelian) cubic ﬁelds of dis«
criminant éx in absolute value.

Then we show by means of a “zeta-function discussion” that
(1) NA(x)~(115/18)x1”, as x~> on,

where c is given in formula (8) below. This result complements un-
published results kindly communicated by Davenport, to the effect
that N(x)=0(x), and by Heilbronn, to the effect that N(x)>clx
(even with the restriction that the ﬁelds be totally real).

It can be shown by class—ﬁeld theory [1]2 that abelian cubic ﬁelds
of discriminantﬂ are enumerated as follows: There is a single ﬁeld
with f=9 or f=ga and there are for 921 exactly 2’ ﬁelds with f
=qo - ~ - q, or f=9q1 ~ - - q“ where the q.- are distinct primes El
(mod 6). (These ﬁelds are in fact subﬁelds of the ﬁeld of the fth roots
of unity.) Thus,

(2) NA(1) = U(x1”)/2 + U(x‘”/9) — 1/2
where
(3) My) = g «M

and u(n) is, in turn, described by the generating function:

so

deﬁned (at ﬁrst) for Re :>1, where q are the primes El (mod 6).
To estimate U(y) we introduce the primes 75—1 (mod 6) and
start with the identity:

HI<1+ 2r')(1— r')’}Hl1 - r"! _
11(1 — «Ir->110 — r0110 — q“)H(1 + r')

We note that each product of “curly brackets," Hf - ~ - I, is ab-
solutely convergent for at least Re s> 1/2, while

(6) [II(1— q--)1'I(1 — r-)]-‘ = r<:)(1 — 2--)(I — 3--).

Moreover.

 

(5) MS)

is a convergent series for Re s>0, with the special value L(1) =1r3"”
by Dirichlet's formula for quadratic class number [2, p. 373]. Hence
from the known behavior of ((5), it follows that the difference ¢(s)
—c/(s—l) is analytic at 3:1, where (using f(2)=1r‘/6) we easily
ﬁnd

As before, q are the primes El(mod 6). Now from the behavior of
¢(s) at x =1, together with the behavior of {‘(x) in the critical strip, we
can show that

We omit the details since Landau's Handbuch presents them not only
for the prime number theorem [3, pp. 180—193] but also for a prob-
lem even involving a similar generating function [3. pp. 649—660].
Formula (1) ﬁnally follows through the use of formula (2). Q.E.D.
