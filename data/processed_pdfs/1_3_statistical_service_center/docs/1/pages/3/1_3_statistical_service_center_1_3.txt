supplied on each time sheet. Time sheet statements regarding
non-Instrumentation Laboratory usage could be used by our budget
section as the basis for billing other users, Our authority for
such charges would come from purchase orders submitted to either
our project or DIC,

3, Continue the current arrangement of having Prof. Morse advise us
on the types of none-Instrumentation Laboratory work, which should
be performed on RDA from a technical standpoint,

Le Continue present practice of having all RDA personnel considered
an Instrumentation Laboratory responsibility. Thus, Instrumenta=
tion Laboratory is clearly respensible for assigning these people
to other work if the analyzer is temporarily or permanently shut
downe

Section 5,0 SUMMARY OF KDA USE

The following is a brief summary of the usage and fiscal arrange=
;5 ments given in more detail in Appendix A and B for the period from October 1,
j 1950 « October 1, 1952:

Percentage of Estimated Cost
Time to User

Instrumentation Lab., usage 55% $50,000 *

NoneInstrumentation Lab. usage 33% &,700 %
(charges reimbursed)

Non=Instrumentation Lab. usage 12% 0

(free usage for Institute
academic activity)

¥ Estimates include overhead at 42%

During this period, the RDA has been used in connection with three
doctorate theses, totaling nearly four months of RDA time, Dr. Seaman's
thesis is listed as part of the Instrumentation Laboratory work while
Dr, Tung's thesis is included in the time of the Mechanical Engineering
Depts This thesis work, plus the time given to Institute departments, shows
that 25% or more of the RDA operation has been in fundamental research., The
charges to other DIC projects are satisfactory but the credits on work out-
side of MIT have seemed too low., For 57.5 days work for Stevens Institute,
Air Force Cambridge HResearch Laboratory, Bendix and the U of Pa,, we have
received a credit of approximately $2375, This figure plus overhead amounts
to $3375, which is far less than the $7500 that we would have charged these
companies under DIC policy. Of this $7500, $1500 would have been for the
industrial fund,

Seetion 6.0 CONCLUSIONS

As this memorandum indicates, we are currently dependent on the use
of both the RDA and Statistical Services for solving our calibration problems,
