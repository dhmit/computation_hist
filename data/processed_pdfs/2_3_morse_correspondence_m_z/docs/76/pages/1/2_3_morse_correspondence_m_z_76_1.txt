Dear Mr, Finigan:

I have delayed writing you a formal invitation for
you and yourclass to inspect the new M.I.T. Computation Center,
until I could be sure that the equipment would be in place -~
there has been some delay in completion of the buillding,

it now seems likely that the machine will be ready
for inspection during the week of May 27. We can handle 30
or fewer in a single group, but if you desire to bring more
than 30, several trips will have to be arranged.

Please let me know, as soon as possible, which day
and what hour would be more convenlent for you, the week of
May 27, and how many will aceompany you (if more than 30,
Successlive groups could be scheduled an houpr apart, since
the demonstration will take about an hour).

If the group or groups are coming by car, we'll
have to arrange for some place for you o park; if they arc
coming by bus, arrangements will have to be made to bring the
bus into the grounds. The more information I can get from you
the more detailled arrangements can be made.

We will be very glad to have you and your students
come â‚¬o the Computation Center and we hope we can arouse
Thelr interest in these new Instrumentalities. With the
rapid advance of computing techniques, it will be necessary

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse
