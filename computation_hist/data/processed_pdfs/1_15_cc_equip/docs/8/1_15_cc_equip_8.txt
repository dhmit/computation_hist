The above estimated costs were based on prices obtained for
Steelcase equipment. IBM Corporation is going to use General Fireproofing
equipment, so I imagine for reasons of compatibility we at MIT should also
buy General Fireproofing equipment, This means that our prices may be
increased by five per cent (5%) and occasionally by ten per cent (10%).

In any case, it is apparent that IBM is paying over half of the cost of
the above equipment in the MIT Computation Center.

As soon as you have had an opportunity to examine this, I would
appreciate hearing from you in order that we may initiate the necessary

purchase orders, etc., to procure this equipment, since (we hope) the ares
will be available in April.

Sincerely yours,

¥F. M. Verzuh
Assistant Director
MIT Computation Center
