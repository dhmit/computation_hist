Institute of Basic Mathematics for
Application to Business

Boston 63, Massachusetts

Dear Mr, Vatter:

Your letter of April 2 to Professor Horse has been
referred to me for reply,

I suggest that your request for machine time be made
through Harvard University by Professor Ronald Howard , Since
your institute is a division of Harvard University. Professor R,
Howard 13 familiar with the procedure concerning problem appli-
cation, since he is a member of the MIT family, However, in this
case, he must get approval from Professor FP, Mosteller at Harvard,

In view of the heavy load on the machine, I suggest the
request for your project be made during the Fall Term, 1959.

Sincerely yours,

F. Md. Verzuh
Assistant Director
