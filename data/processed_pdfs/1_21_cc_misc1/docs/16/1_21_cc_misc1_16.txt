Dear Professor Morse:

re ER, As it turns out, I will actu-
ally be in Boston for several days, but
I cannot get there before Friday.

Would it be convenient for you to have
lunch with me next Monday? Perhaps you
could leave a message for me at the
Statler where I will be staying.

Dr. John G., Kemeny, Chairman
Department of Mathematics and Astronomy
Dartmouth College

Hanover, New Hampshire

Dear Dr. Kemeny:

The two days you mention, Friday the 13th and

Saturday the 14th of June, are the dates of Commencement
and related festivities at M.I.T. Since I take no formal
part in these exercies this year, I had been intending to
stay away because of the confusion. Would it be possible
for you to come down a day earlier, on Thursday the 12th,
when I will be in my office and when it would be possible
to get lunch at the Faculty Club?

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse
Director
