this JourNAL [7], we shall turn our attention to the computation of Units. ey
First of all we shall show (leaning once more on the Minkowski, | ( Bi QP)

orithm) that all units are discoverable by the “neighbor process” of (QSR), (SQP)

p. 820-833. In so doing we must restrict our lattice to a mody]e LEMMA. Every reduced matrix ¢ has either one or two (reduced)

neighbors of each type.

@. The field ® need not be abelian but the module I must be non-singular
(i. e., of dimension three over the rationals). The units would then lie ip 9

the order of the module 2.

Outline of Proof. We must consider the subdivision into cases as deter-
mined by the relative magnitudes of each row: (|p|, | ql, |r], |si]),

(compare 11). There are actually twenty-four different cases (to within
elementary interchanges of rows and columns and changes of sign in rows).
The details are omitted in the interests of brevity we simply remark that
this method was used in the (weaker) statement made earlier [7], p. 830
that there are from three to six neighbors.

Secondly we shall consider the manner in which the units should phe
written. As we observed in [7], p. 833 certain 3 XX 4 matrices are propor-
tional only under certain rearrangements of rows and columns. This makes
it desirable to have a hypercomplex notation, which also brings out normal
symmetries of the matrices.

In comparing our modified algorithm with its Minkowskian progenitor
we start with the realization that what we are doing is refining the algebraic

Since every degenerate Minkowskian triple has non-degenerate triples (i. e.,
basis triples) as neighbors, it takes very little effort to deduce from the same
proof that any two Minkowskian bases are connected by a chain of Minkowskian
bases as neighbors. Hence the lemmas yield the following result and with it

THEOREM. Any two reduced quadruples can be connected by a chain of
neighboring (reduced) quadruples.

19. Proximity of algorithms. In Section 5 (above) we showed that
every Minkowskian basis is part of a reduced quadruple, which means, in
effect, that every Minkowskian triple overlaps a reduced quadruple. The
“converse ” seems to be false, indicating that there are “more” reduced
quadruples than Minkowskian triples in some sense perhaps analogous to the
sense that the quadratic algorithm we introduced in 2 (above), possessing
“mediants ” in addition to regular convergents of the simple continued frac-
tion contains “more ” reduced triples (see Section 25 below). Lemma 18.2

this manner the group &* of hypercomplex units in the enlarged system is

can be given as follows:

Now, the only possible proportionalities that mix rows are those coming
from the group *, i.e., based on units, for the cube of any element of ©*

every ® is one of a set of 7/2 (i.e., r/2 different © points ” in the “chain”

Case IT: M equwalent to a mormal module. Here r=2 or 8 and
every ® is one of a set of 37/2 except when the ¢ is proportional (row by row)
to one in which three of the quantities P,Q, R, S are conjugates. (In the
exceptional case ® is one of a set of r/2 again). |

In the table [7, p. 832] we find evidence of some of these cases for
r=28. (ase I corresponds to A®=148, while Case II (or its exception)
corresponds to the proportionality classes that occur by twelves (or by fours).
Note that the module for A? = 196 is neither an ideal nor normal, yet the
correspondence “by fours” means it must be proportional to a normal
module (with even a normal basis). The numerical work is being carried
much further than in Part I, but it will be the subject of a separate report.

95. Concluding remarks. In Part I, Section 2, a modified quadratic
simple continued fraction algorithm was outlined. It turns out to be more
conventional than first thought, in fact it is equivalent to the continued

fraction algorithm with the “ mediant ” fractions thrown in. The geometrical

hg . » . . . i * .
construction given in 2 can be seen to be a variation of Smith’s construction

[10].
In Part III, the concluding portion, we shall treat the algorithm as a

means of discovering small norms” (analogously with the Pell Equation).

Errata for Part I (i.e. [7]).
