COMPUTER SCIENCE RESEARCH TANZL

William B., Kehl, University of Pittsburgh, Chairman

Mr. Fosdick, Brown University, rapporteur

The panel was fundamentally concerned that the quality, depth, and significance
of computer research will determine the academic vole computer science will have in
universities, With this in mind, there was a strong feeling that it was the responsi~
bility most particularly of the medium as well as larger computing centers to identify
this ares of research, re-examine its development as a discipline, and encourage ite
growth through all areas of the university, Except where examples were needed, the
group did not concern itself with specific research techniques or results.

In the preliminary plenary session, five problems were proposed for discussion:

1. How do we educate our colleagues to the understanding that this is an active and
worthwhile field for research in its own right?

2. What types of activities and the organization of these can be uniquely identified
and developed with academic standards so that computer science research will
not be considered a subordinate function?

3. How do we interest bright young students to eater this field?

4, How do we achieve recognition of the center's steffi by the university faculty
and how de we find an acadernic home for the staff?

5. What are the problems of communication between research workers in this
area”

1. How Do We Educate Our Colleagues To The Understanding That This Is An Active
4nd V orthwhile Field Tor Research In Its Twn Right” |

The primary tesk is getting research started. The school in which the com=~
puting center is comparatively new still expressed a concern over the problem of
educating their colleagues to realise that there is an area of activity that can be
clearly distinguished as computer science research, On the other hand, this need
was not as strongly indicated in those universities where the computer installation
had a longer history. It would appear that thie ig a transitory problem in most cases
and that its duration depends on the mutual simulation and response between the
student and faculty as they become exposed to the field. A particular warning was
repeated frequently that we were not engaged in the questionable matter of "pursuading”
the faculty or the missionary undertaking to formulate and solve all their problems.
But we should rather give evidence of what can be done with a computer and what
structures are now useful that before the era of computers was not, Misunderstandings


of the relationship of computing to traditional mathematics seemed to cause some
of the problems For example there was a feeling that there was not sufficient
understanding or recognition of numerical analysis which involved experimental
technigues using a computer rather than theoretical analysis It was even ques~
tioned by one pans] member as to whether the relationship of computer science to
other fields such as linguistics was not as close as to the pure mathematical die-
ciplinas

Several suggestions were made to improve the understanding of computer
science First a computing center staff with representatives from different
academic areas might help spread the understanding of thie field At one university
this was accompanied by offering & special series of lectures on applications to
certain disciplines A second group of suggestions dealt with sloppy computer
housekeeping operation and sloppy documentation of distributed programs which
tend to discredit the field of research itself. The proceedings of the Harvard
Switching Symposium of 1957 was given as an example of a responsible publication
There was a general feeling that the way to establish computer science was to do
creditable research deeds not words, that computer science was becoming recoge
nized and that we need not have a chip on our shoulder.

Three specific recommendations were put on record by the pansl as impor~
tant contributions to solving this problem:

1. THE CENTER SHOULD RESERVE ITAFF TIME COMPUTING TIME, AND
BUDGETARY SUPPORT SPECIFICALLY FOR DOING COMPUTING RESEARCH
AND SUPPORTING COMPUTING RESEARCH BY OTHERS IN REMOTE AREAS
BUT WHICH WERE STILL PERTINENT TO THIS FIELD~ (IT WAS POINTED
OUT THAT THIS ACTIVITY DOES NOT APPLY TO THE SMALL COMPUTING
CENTERS AS DEFINED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT IN THE PANEL ON
BUDGET AND ADMINISTRATION).

2 THE CENTER SHOULD DE IDENTIFIED AS A RESEARCH ORGANIZATION
RATHER THAN A SERVICE ORGANIZATION. { AT ONE UNIVERSITY A
SEPARATE ORGANIZATION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIE ACTIVITY.)

3. EDITORIAL STANDARDE OF A HIGHER QUALITY WERE RECOMMENDED
FOR PAPERS SUBMITTED TO JOURNALS, AND SIMILARLY HIGHER SELF
IMPOSED ETANDARDS FOR PAPERS PRESENTED BY UNIVERSITY STAFF
AT COMPUTER MEETINGS, THIS SUGGESTION WAS ALSO INTENDED TO
APPLY TO THE INTERCHANGE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMS AND REPORTS,

1. What Types of Activities And The Organization Of These Can Be Uniquely Iden

tified And Developed With Academic Standards So That The © er Science Rew
gearch Vill Not Be Considered A Subordinate Function?

Gradually throughout the sessions, certain topics were identified by various
panel members with computer science. Although no extended discussion or classi
fication of these followed, those topics frequently mentioned included:


computer~oriented numerical analysis
programming research

information or list processing languages
information retrieval and language translation
simulation

logical design

mechanical proofs

automatic theory

the development of algorithms

the theory of compilers

Une group felt it premature to talk about those areas in the field where
the theory is not yet developed, as for example, the lack of a theory of compilers,
and they felt that there was still inadequate content for a proven discipline. Some
of the difficulty in identifying the field was because it is so widely disciplinary.
We must remain close to the academic disciplines because the work is worthy of
this identification and must not be a victim of ingrown professionalism.

A gecond group pointed out that some new entities such as list processing
languages had been introduced by the advent of computers, that existing subjects
such as logic had been influenced, and that there were critical needs for the new
work being doue in computer research. The question of whether there was a
separate department for this work right now was not as important as that it should
be insured that existing departinent boundaries don't restrict it «« that research in
computation should not be compared with research other than computation.

Some felt that to accomplish this, there was the need for some kind of academic
entity for students to join in, and that without such an entity, it was not possible to
build up the student body in this arez at all levels that are needed and that you would
like to have to insure unrestricted development of computer science. In one univers
sity the department of applied mathematics has been broadened to include computer
science, At a second, four departments have joined in steering towards an inter
departmental center. Degrees will be granted in one of the four departments upon
completion of a set of requirements defined by the center and upon the recommendation
of the center, This avoids the problems of isolation and rejection by other departments
as well as the problems of pigeonholing of credits by schools,

One university will introduce a master's program in computer information
sciences with new courses this year, They plan on gradually going to a separate
department with a doctoral program. Their feeling was at there was a whole
fabrication of techniques ignored by existing departments. They made a distinction
between analytic methods used to study natural languages in linguistics and the

syrthetic methods of mechanical and programming languages in computer sciences
between analytic methods in existence proofs in numerical analysis as belonging to

COE

traditional mathematics and algorithms in numerical analysis as a part of the come

   

puter sciences


Although no uniform opinion could be obtained; there was no question that
cellent work in this field should be Fewal ed with advanced degrees. There

3. How Do We Interest Dright Young Students To Enter This Field?

   

   

 

There was a brief discussion on the problem of interesting bright young

students to do their major work in this field, There was an agreed advantage of

having funds for the computing center to allocate to students for thie type of work.
such a policy was carrixl out extensively at one university, and was not uncommon |
at others, and had proven successful. There was also considerable comment thet |
the shortage of personnel in the computer field was a strong incentive. Most of |
the difficulties and awkwardnesses revolved about the academic degree requirements

that had aiready been discussed.

 

ment that as long as the budget allocation for

B. What Are The Problems Of Communication Between Research Workers In This
Area”

The Problem of communication, most particularly the question of another
national conference of computing center directors, was referred to the plenary
session. Feelinge of isolation were comzacn, and the unanimity of opinion that
each computing center obtain a budget for more than one computer specialist em=
phasized that feeling,
