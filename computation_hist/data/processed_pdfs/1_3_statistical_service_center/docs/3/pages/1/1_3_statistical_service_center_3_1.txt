I have reviewed your letter of June 22. to Dr. Draper. relative
to the transfer of the Differential Analyzer facilities to shit: labora-
tory end particularly to the transfer of the associated shop facilities
effective July 1. 1950. V

. _ We find no point of difference with your lester and accept it
in its entirety.

I believe you have talked wish. Paul Conic}: relative to the
transfer of the inventory to the Instrumentation Laboratory. We have in.—
formed Paul that this transfer is acceptable to us and have requested his
advice to the and that the transfer cam be effected in a manner acceptable
to the Government auditors. Howard Forbes, Purchasing Agent of this
laboratory. should be kept informsdof all action in this area.

 

Non-staff personnel in our laboratory are under the supervision
of Robert S. Temblyn. I am referring your letter to lie?) so that he can
take the action necessary to get Frost. Forbes anal ‘J‘intzhsr on our payroll
effective July 1. 1950.

The DIG number assigned 30 the Differential Analyzer is 6783.
The salaries of the three shop when and all further :mterialo required. by
the shop should be (merged against this number. Thu same number will, of
course. be charged with the inventory transfer alreuﬂy mentioned. This
mfbe: will also carry tho salary of Fradrickson am}. the second Znstnmenta—
Mon Laboratory man whom we send over for training purposes.
