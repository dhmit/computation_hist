SCHOOL OF INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT

ESTABLISHED UNDER A GRANT FROM 50 MEMORIAL DRIVE
THE ALFRED P. SLOAN FOUNDATION, INC. CAMBRIDGE 39, MASSACHUSETTS

December 30, 1957

Professor Philip Morse
6-109

Dear Phil:

We are planning to have a Summer Session on the subject of
Industrial Dynamics during the last two weeks of August 1958. Plans
for the program have not been made as yet but, presumably, we will
need numerous brief computer runs on the 704 during that time. I
do not expect that the total amount of computer time will be of any
great consequence, probably a few hours, but the times at which it

is available will be important to the orderly progress of the program.

This is for your preliminary information, and we will keep you
informed as plans become more definite. It will probably be early
in the summer before reasonably final plans for the program are
fixed.

Sincerely,

Ja i
