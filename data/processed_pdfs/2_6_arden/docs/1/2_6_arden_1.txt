Dear Mr. Well:

You will find enclosed outlines of 6.25, "Machine-
Aided Analysis,” and 6.25T, "Introduction to Digital
Computers.” 6.25 is no longer offered since it has
essentially been replaced by 6.25T. I am sorry that we
have no notes available for 6.25 but we are not able to
put together a complete copy of our old notes which are
not going to be re-issued in view of the fact that the
course has been discontinued.

A set of notes on ¢oding for the M.I.T.-I.B.M,
704 computer is available from the Technology Store for
a charge in the neighborhood of four to five dollars.
Unfortunately, I know of no text which meets the needs of
courses of this type and at M.I.T. none has been used.

= "UO & 6

Sincerely yours,

Dean N. Arden
Assistant Professor of
Electrical Engineering
