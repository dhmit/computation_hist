I. INTRODUCTION

XPERIMENTAL data on spinels indicate that the
distribution of cations over tetrahedral and octa-
hedral sites cannot be explained on the basis of electro-
static and elastic energies alone. Electronic bonding
energies must be considered. Also, no explanation has
yet been given for the difference beween Fe;O4, which
alone transforms on cooling from a cubic to an ortho-
rhombic spinel at a relatively low transition temperature,
and other spinels, such as Mn3O4, ZnMn,O4, CuFe,0y,
which become on cooling tetragonal at a relatively high
transition temperature. The tetragonality of metallic
indium and of Caln;O4 and CdIn,O4 have never been
explained. For hausmannite there has been no definitive
selection between the formulas MnO - Mn,03 and 2MnO
-MnQ,. The difference in resistivity discontinuities
through the transition temperatures of I‘e3O4, on the one
hand, and Mn;O4 and ZnMn,O4, on the other, has not
been explained. Neither has any explanation been given
for the fact that Mn3O4 1s paramagnetic at least down
to 72°K despite the large magnetic moments of Mn**,
Mn**t, and Mn** ions. In this paper it is suggested that
covalent forces are responsible for the above effects. A
new magnetic-exchange mechanism, “semicovalent
exchange,” is proposed.

II. IONIC ORDERING
A. Description of Spinels

Many oxides consist of a face-centered cubic lattice
of O*~ ions which is held together by interstitial cations.
There are two kinds of interstices between the elements
of such a lattice, tetrahedral interstices with four nearest
neighbors and octahedral interstices with six nearest
neighbors. If all the tetrahedral sites are empty and all
the octahedral sites are filled, the crystal has the rock-
salt structure; if only tetrahedral sites are occupied, the
crystal has the zinc-blende structure. In oxides with
the spinel structure there are cations in each type of
interstice ; twice as many octahedral as tetrahedral sites
are occupied. The spinel lattice may be thought of as

Theory of Ionic Ordering, Crystal Distortion, and Magnetic Exchange
Due to Covalent Forces in Spinels*

(Received September 1, 1954)

Elastic- and electrostatic-energy considerations are insufficient for an explanation of cation ordering
between tetrahedral and octahedral sites in spinels. Tetrahedral, octahedral, and square covalent bonds are
also important when cations are to be accommodated in these sites. The square bonds in octahedral sites
can cause the tetragonal distortion observed in Mn;Oy, v-Mn20;, ZnMn20,, CuFe:04, CuCr.04, Caln,Oy,
CdIn,04, and metallic indium. A new magnetic exchange mechanism, “semicovalent exchange,” which is
consistent with the covalent model, is used to explain the magnetic properties of spinels.

an ordered mixture of the zinc-blende and rock-salt
structure.

There are two general classes which have the spinel
lattice, the 2-4 spinels with the formula 2X*+0Q.Z*0,
and the 2-3 spinels X**0O-Y**0;. In order to describe
the cation distribution, these formulas may be written
as Z(X)04 or X(ZX)0O4 and X (Y304 or Y(XY)O,,
where the ions within the parentheses occupy octahedral
sites. If there is only one kind of cation in the octahedral
sites, the spinel is called normal. If there are equal
amounts of both kinds of cations in the octahedral sites,
the spinel is inverse. If there is an unequal number of
each kind of cation in the octahedral sites, the spinel is
mixed.

B. Critique of Previous Work

Since the physical properties of any spinel depend
not only on the kind of cations in the spinel but also on
their distribution within the interstices, it is important
to understand what forces are responsible for cation
ordering within a lattice. Verwey and his co-workers''
have made a study of the cation arrangement in oxides
with spinel structure. A summary of the experimental
determination of cation location is given in Table I.

Since the observed cation distributions do not always
