TRIP REPORT

Place Visited: Bates College, Lewiston, Maine ks
' " ‘ - ’ vryS)cs
Persons Seen: Professor Karl 5. Woodcock, Department of Hathermnaties

This call was made on Thursday afternoon, September 19. There has

been virtually no activity directly associated with the computing field.

Professor Woodcock does not believe that the need for digital computation

on a scale requiring the MIT Computation Center exists at Bates. They

offer no graduate program and the undergraduate curriculum is such that

~ such facilities are outside the scope of their needs. I suggested to him that
there might well be faculty members in various departments who would like

to do research which involved aumerical computation. He agreed to

investigate this possibility.

Professor Woodcock thought that sometime during the fall term a visit to
the Computation Center by a class (or some representati ves from a class)
might be beneficial to them. I told him we would bé glad to show them the
Center and possibly arrange a demonstration if he would let us know when he
expected to arrive.
