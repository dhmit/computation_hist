Dear Dr. Brown:

The Digital Computer Laboratory has been asked
to set up a DIC contract between it and the Group 61 at =y
the Lincoln Laboratory. I am enclosing the following a
material which is pertinent to this contract negotiation: \

1) Subject contract for a program and mathe-
matical research for Lincoln Laboratory
to DIC Project 6345, e,

2) Memorandum from C. W. Farr, Group 61,
confirming request outlined in item 1.

3) Research proposal describing the proposed
contract.

This proposal has been discussed with Messrs. Forrester,
Everett, Wiesner, etec. at the Lincoln Laboratory, and it

is at their request that we have agreed to provide the
services of the staff of the Digital Computer Group Ea
(DIC 6345) during the fiscal pedod beginning July 1, 1955 -
June 30, 1956. 1Item No. 1 provides a technical deseription
of the work which is to be performed under this contract |
with specific areas clearly outlined as well as a statement
of the qualifications of the Digital Compiuter Laboratory
group. The amount of fthe contract has been set for $35,000,
which 1s to cover the cost of a total of 4 man years' effort
during this period. (There is to be no machine charge for
the Whirlwind Computer.)

Item No. 2 serves as a confirmation of the ap-
proval of the Lincoln Laboratory to have this work done.

This proposal has been discussed with Prof. Morse
on July 6th and it has his approval. Unfortunately,
Prof. Morse is away on vacation for a month and is therefore
not available to add his signature to the proposal.
