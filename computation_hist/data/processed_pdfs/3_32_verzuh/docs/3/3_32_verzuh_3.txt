Attn: WCRR

This shipment ccnslnts of on: reproducible (transptrcnt
ozalid) Ind four copies.

As i promised Dr. E. F. Little during his visit
to M. l. T. on April 9, 1953, I am also including in the
above shipment 5 copl-s of Technical Report R-SZ entitled
"chhniqnc: for Solving Fixed—Gun Aircraft Pursuit Problem
on the Rockefeller Differential Analyzer.” This report
describes work which we havc performed on the H. l. T.
Rockefellor Differential Analyzer. You will noticc that
it actually bcsrs another Air Force Contract number. This
was necessary because the costs or the operation of the
Analyser are being supported by this latter contract.
this work is described in our Quarterly Progress Report

(page 10 and reference 6}, I felt it advisazle to send copies
for your usc.

Since

lr conclusion, i wish to remind you that our local
3. I. C. office has requested an extension of our contract

no. AF33(616)-128 through December 31. 1953 without additional
funds.
