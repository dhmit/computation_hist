Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Cambridge, Massachusetts

Dear Professor Morse,

I have talked with Dr. Verzuh about the computer program
at MoI.T., and am communicating with you at his suggestion, I
have used the Whirlwind I computer to great advantage in evaluating
properties of thin metal films; in this research I have been
associated with Professor Louis Harris, Recently I returned to the
Institute after a year's leave of absence during which I initiated
a digital computation program at the University of Utrecht, in
the Netherlands,

Dr. Verzuh has told me about plans for expanding computer
activities at the Institute; as I would be very interested in
participating in these activities, I would appreciate a chance to
discuss possibilities with you. Your secretary has told me that
your schedule is very full, so I am sending you a resume and some
of my publications prior to talking to you personally. Perhaps you
could let me know (ext. 30-195 or ext, 2106) when it would be
convenient for you to see me,

 

Sincerely,
Wb
