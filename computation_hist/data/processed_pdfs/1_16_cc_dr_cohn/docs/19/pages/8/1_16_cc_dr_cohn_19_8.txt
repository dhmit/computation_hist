since otherwise, as noted in 5, Gm(z) has zeros. In fact, if 6 has bounded
partial quotients, we can have f(z) X (2—0)'2'" in any Stolz neighborhood

means that the following holds:

We can supplement the last result by noting that ii Poincare theta

These last results are in contrast with a result of Wintner [’7], who
