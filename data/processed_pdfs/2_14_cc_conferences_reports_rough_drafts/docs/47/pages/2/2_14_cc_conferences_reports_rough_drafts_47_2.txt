Experience with the Center has shown them the value of machine
computation and has enabled them to estimate the wagnitude of
their requirements. By buying or renting their own machines
they will free the Center to devote more machine time to thesis,
class, and laboratory work, which is at present expanding rapidly
in volume. f AT s B W AT R
A number of compiler programs aimed at improving the
flexibility of use of the 709 and also at eéxpanding its none-
numerical capabllities, have been developed during the past
year. A linking-segment system will enable the programmer to
use several different programming languages in a single program.
The COMIT compiler-interpreter for mechanical language trans-
lation has been virtually completed and is being adapted for
the 709. The LISP programming system has developed to the
point where 1t can get the machine to carry out algebraic
manipulations. With further work the system will facilitate the
useé of the machine in more general mathematical problem-solving.
Extension to other machine-learning experiments is planned.
Details of these programs ¢an be found in the semi-annual reports
of the Center. ‘ ‘ |

The use of the Center by the thirty-one cooperating New
England universities has also increased during the past year,
Although several of the larger users have installed small machines
on their own campuses, their participation in the activities of
the Center has not diminished; in several instances, i1t has grown.
Several colleges have brought their classes in computation to
the Center for Saturday laboratory sessions.
