Dear Profess or Martin:

Along with nearly all organizations such as ours, we suffer from
a drastic shortage of competent technical people. We have found that
one of the best ways to alleviate this shortage is to expand our use of
automatic computing machines. These machines relieve our highly trained
technical personnel of many routine tasks so that they can devote their

time to creative efforts.

However, expanding the use of automatic aids has created its own
problems. The effective utilization of these automatic aids itself
demands the services of highly qualified technical people. It thus might
be argued that we have only “robbed Peter to pay Paul," but we feel that
one competent man in this activity can be of such assistance to our tech—
nical staff that our problems can be solved with a minimum number of
trained personnel.
