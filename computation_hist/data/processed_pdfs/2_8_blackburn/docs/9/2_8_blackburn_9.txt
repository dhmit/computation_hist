Dear Professor Morse:

I have just been informed that a Data Processing Seminar for
University Professors will be held August 5 - 9, 1957 at Endicott, New York.
The purpose of this seminar is to bring together professors and instructors
who are currently responsible for courses in the Business Data Processing
field. It is intended that those in attendance will be able to discuss the
content of existing courses, new applications and new courses.

Also, an Introduction to Data Processing for University Professors
will be held August 19 - 23, 1957 at Endicott, New York. The purpose of
this class is to introduce professors and instructors to the problem of
teaching and organizing classes in Business Data Processing.

I would appreciate it if you would submit to me a list of those
professors at your institution who are interested in attending either of the
above meetings as soon as possible but at the latest by June 30. Major
emphasis will be on applications of the IBM 650.

Thank you for your co-operation in this matter.
Sincerely,
