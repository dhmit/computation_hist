Mr. Robert E. Dalton Page 2

As you know, an IBM 704 is available at the Institute
and at present the completely transistorized TX-0 is also
available. It is intended that the 704 will be replaced by a
709 in the not-too-distant future. It seems safe to say in
the foreseeable future, the most up-to-date computation equipment
will be available at the Institute.

If you should be in this area, I would like very much
to meet you and discuss further the opportunities at M.I.T.

Sincerely yours,

Dean N. Arden
Asgistant Professor
of Electrical Engineering
