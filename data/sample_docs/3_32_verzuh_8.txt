ABSTRACT
This
paper
is primarily
concerned
with
the solution
of b oundary-value
pro b l ems b y means of automatic
co mpu tin9
ec;zuipment (both analogue
and digital).
Specifically,
in
addition
to the familiar
desk calculator,
the following
di g l tal computers
were u sed in this
study:
the type 602 A
El ·ectromechanical
Calculator,
the type 604 E lectr oni c
Calculator,
the Ca.rd-Programmed
Calculator,
and the M. l.T.
Whirlwind
Computer,
The anlegue
stu d ies we re obt airted by
use of the M.l.T.

This study
is primarily
concerned
with the solution
of ordinary
differential
eq u a tions
in whic h certain
bound ary conditions
are s.pe ci fi ed at t wo or more values
of the independent
varia:ble.
Such problems
~gene.rally
called
boundary-value
problem s.
It is clearly
evident
that
the so lution
of such prob le ms is inherently
more
dif f icu lt than the solution
of tnit!at-vaiu~
pro .b lems in
wh ich all
condi ti on s are specified
' atone
poi n t.
The
pa rtic u l ar problems
studies
are furt her com plicat~d
by the
fact that their
solutions
are r equi r ed over an infinite
ra n ge wh ich contains
re g ions of non ·ran a l yticity-;--
