generally, two such matrices hav1ng three of their four column vectors res

Since the eigenvalues are also conjugate algebraic integers, in the conjugate
cubic ﬁelds, they arc either all 1 or are conjugates of a nontrivial unit of
the ﬁeld. From the rational independence of the column vectors, the eigen-
values are all 1 only when the two 3 X 4 matrices are identical. In fact
in the example (A2 = 81) of ﬁg. 2, there are even closed circuits such as

trivial unit). In each of the ﬁve cases treated here, independent (non-trivial)
units can be observed. It is clear that as we take an increasing large number
of different ﬁelds the a priori necessity of obtaining different units will
increase the complexity of the non-trivial circuits, but no further speculation
on this will be attempted at present.
