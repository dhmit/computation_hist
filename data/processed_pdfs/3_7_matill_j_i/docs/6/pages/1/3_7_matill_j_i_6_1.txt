Dear Professor Morse,

Plans for the meeting of college publicity here on

January 9 and 10 are proceeding smoothly, and I'm pleased
that we can count on showing those concerned with it the
Computation Center and the cooperative program with New
Ingland colleges. I have this down for 11:30 on Thursday
morning, January 9; we will have lunch at 1:15 at the
Faculty Club, so you have as long as until 1 o'clock if you
want it.

I shall try to hold attendance to a small number, so that

you can handle the whole group together. To this end, I =0
think I should have a 1list of colleges which are now par- e
ticipating in the cooperative program - and which have done

so and may soon do so again., Then before we let others

attend the meeting I can at least be sure that representa-
tives of these schools are accommodated. R

We'll be sending out preliminary information in about =2
week, and I'd be glad to have the 1list before then i1f it
can be arranged. Do you want me to send any other in-
formation about the Computation :Center to participants
at this stage, to save you some’time next month?
