Dear Professor Morse:

In eaccordance with our recent discussion regerding the need
for disseminating information regerding punched-card equipment to the
staff, I am enclosing a copy of a desoription of the punched-card method.
This particular note was prepared for a dual purpose:

l. To be used as a primer for the students in the
digital computation laboratory course last spring.

2. To provide members of the administrative staff
with certain feetures of the equipment which might
be used for mechanization of records.

I am enclosing this copy to see whether you feel some of this material
might be of interest to some of the members of the seminar groupe.

It occured to me thet perhaps an actual demonstration of one
of the celeulators in operation might be of sufficient interest to the
group to warrant such & demonstration at a later date.

Although it is not as complete as I would like it, I hope to

have some material in shape for presentation at the seminar next Tuesday,
October 10.

Very truly yours,

Feo M. Verzuh
