A8

(1t performs the general integration Srudv as contrasted wlth the
operation Sudt of the electronic analog computer). There are
18 integrators, each having an average approximate accuracy of
0.01%. There are 4 tables available for input and output of

data and results. Two of these have automatic curve tracing
devices which permit the insertion of arbitrary expérimental
data. -

A recent addition to the machine Lac “een a Vector Con-
version Device which permits the conversion from rectangular
to polar coordinates and vice versa. It can also be used for
generating sines, cosines, and other trigonometric functions.
Other recent additions are the provision of three 4-Shaft Adder
Units which permit addition or subtraction of as many as 4
variables simultaneously.

The Analyzer 18 generally used for the solution of simul-
taneous sets of non-linear ordinary differential equations. The
available 18-integration capacity and associated input and
output equipment permits the solutlion of very complex problems,
e.g., the simultaneous solution of 6 to 8 second order differen-
tial equatibns. It can also be used for synthesis and analysis
of complicated control problems of various types. The machine
has an approximate accuracy of .01% and a solution time of about
15 minutes.

A prime distinction between this machine and earlier models
is the ease with which 1t may be set up for solution of compli-
cated problems. JSpecifically, a two-wire data transmission system
employing cross-bar switches and relays is used for interconnection

purposes° Punched tapes for machine instruction allows one to
