COMMITTEE ON MACHINE METHODS OF COMPUTATION
Minutes of the Fourth Meeti
Academic Year 52-53

Persons Present: G. S. Brown, S. H. Caldwell, J. W. Forrester,
ERs ri C. C. Lin, P. M. Morse, and F. Verzuh.

The meeting began with the discussion of the case of
Mr. Benington, who appears to desire to transfer from Mathematics
to Electrical Engineering.

On Professor Brown's arrival, the talk then turned to
the problem of courses in machine computation in the Electrical
Engineering Department. After some discussion there was fairly
general agreement that there was need for several "service courses”
which would acquaint men who did not intend to design machines with
enough details about machine properties for them to be able to use
machines. The feeling was that more detail was needed In such a
service course than could be given in one term. The suggestion was
that perhaps the proposed one-term course of Scott-Adams-Verzuh
be expanded into & two-term course available for seniors and graduate
students, which would include enough material on punch card equip-
ment to constitute a good introduction to this subject, as well as
an introduction to the properties of analogue and digital computers.
This course plus the eventual one-year course in the Mathematics
Department on numerical analysis should provide a solid background
for the use of machines or as preparation to more advanced courses
on machine design.

The more advanced courses on machine design were not dis-
cussed in any detail: it was considered that such courses were
primarily the problem of the Electrical Engineering Department and
that this department had them well in hand.

at
3 p.m. The suggested agenda would be a discussion oi the present
assistantship program and a consideration of possible modification

in next year's program.
