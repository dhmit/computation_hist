—\ exp ur, where A, p are neéw constants. If we simply let x — 0 we find that the

previous values of H(r) yield the special cases H(r) = —\Q\ + 1)/(y e
and H(r) = —A\ respectively. e

In these special cases, we can perform the limiting process (of confluence)
and find that when H (r) = —A\ exp ur, (7) becomes
(8) Rz, y; 2, y) = Jo(20')
where v = —u~ (exp px — exp ur') (exp py — exp py'). Ifin (6) y g

we find that for H(r) = —A\ 4+ 1)/(r + »)°, (7) still yields the Riemann fyp,.
tion but V is replaced by its limit —(z — 2') (¥ — ¥)/(@+y+») @ +y + b
Likewise (8) yields the Riemann function for H(r) = —\ when v is replaced hy
its limit — A(z — @)y — ¥)- '
" Thus the Riemann function is found in closed form when H(r) is the rather
versatile function —A(A + 1)u’/sinh® p(r 4 »).

4. Riemann’s Fourier integral expression. Perhaps a more promising method
of finding Riemann functions is one mentioned by Riemann. By changing
the variables of (1) tor = z + y and s = x — y and separating the new variables,
Riemann solved a class of boundary value problems by means of a Fourier
superposition. On comparing this solution with the one that would have heep
obtained by using the Riemann function, Riemann [6; 179-181] arrived at g
heuristic result which we now state in the following form:

If we let

(9) R* = %r [ exp tk(s — s")W(r,r"; k) dk

where W (r, r’; k) 1s defined by the ordinary dzfferential equation

dW/dr* +[k* + HP)]W = 0
(10)
W =0, dW /dr = 1 at r=r'

)

then, changing to the old variables, we find R* satisfies the relation

(11) R* = 3[sgn(z — 2’) + sgn(y — ¥)IR(z, y; ', ¥').

| We can express W in terms of well-known functions only in a few cases, for
instance where H(r) = —X or —A(A + 1)/7°. In these cases W takes the values
(12a) sin(r — )k — N/ — N

and

(12b) dx(rr’)* Im[H (| k | DHZS( & | )],

respectively. Further development of the theory of differential equations may
make enough functions “known’’ to permit W to be expressible in closed form
