TOs Professor P. M. Morse
FROM3 F. M. Verzuh
DATE: Jnnuary 27, 1956

SUBJECT: ONR USage of the WW1 Compubter Durlng the 6-Month Period
July l; = December 31, 1955

In accordanoe'with our budget discu331on5'with Mr. Fo Go Weyl, ONR,
I have propared & 6=~month summary of ONR usage of WWl. The abtached
: 4~pa§e table contains o brealdown of WW1 usage on the project basise

During this 6-month interval, ONR's "free time" usage of WWl
breaks down es follows:

 

8. Machine Computetion Committes 24,708,635

bo Solid State and Moleculer Theory (Slater) 29,092,74

@ co Miscellaneous projects 2l,232012
$75,083,49

The total machine usage during this &month period for this type of
work is 18,006.6 minutes, or approximately 300 hours.

I Think the information contained in the following table, such es
problem number, title, programmer, M.I.T. Depertment, supsrvisor,
DIC contract number, ONR contract, minutes used, snd “free time® dellar

value, should give Mr., Weyl all the information he nesds for budget
discussionse. ,

A consideration of the attached statistics reveals several items
which are worthy of mentione. Specifically, some of the thesis ressarch
is quite expensive as illustrated in the case of Jack Uretsky's |
problem 235 in which he has spent $13,925 during a G-month periods As |
o matter of fact, he has spent $18,132.70 on this problsm since
November, 1954, Similarly, B. Campbell has spent $12,834. on problem 245 |
during this 6-month period, and $15,863.35 since November, 1954, |
Likewise, Mr. K. Bryan has spent $1,870 during the pest six months and
a total of $19,941.60 since November, 1964, I think the G-month expendlnure_
of Slater!s group =- $29,092.74 is a fair indication of the efforts of -
his group. ¥urthermore, his group has spent $47,944,25 since
