In commence with your recent request, I have prepared a memo
cc-u mich lists the ottiee equip-ant requirements for the IIIT Commutation
Center. This list in a sense is not caplet. since it does 392 list all 0:!
o! the equipment in the 704 root end the 65° and m erase. However, since
III has lsred to beer ll) 0! these costs, we are not too canoerned. An
eminetion of the contract with 1‘ indieetes thnt they would furnish the
equipment in the tolloving mess

in. NI university-II leunrch Assistants Room 153, 157

However, I should mention that in some 01 our internal discussions
with Peyson Hunter it was indicated that perhaps the Computation Center
Headquarters and 3. rev other areas night be serviced by Ill tor compatibility
reasons -- from the aesthetic ofﬁce appearance viewpoint. Prof. Horse and
I thought that we might consider asking III to furnish the entire first floor

in addition to their comitmnts to furnish the Berk Room end KAI area in the
basement.
