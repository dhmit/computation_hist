The first improvement we wish to make is to provide for post-
sorteming tepes and dyums, We also wish to modify the Share Assea-
bly Program 8Â¢ thet 1t will reocognize post-mortesm roquest cards aod
ccmpile suitable calling suguences whichk, when exscuted, would call
the post-morten routine iato atorage to do the desired post-aortea.
This was the reased we chose to uge the Share sysbolic card forsat
for the reguest cavds, Also W wish the sssembler to store the
syabol table op tape so that it will oot be necessary to read it
in from caxds each time a post-morten is to bHe dono,
