debugged. This version of a loaden which should be completed in
the Spring, will operate entirely in core memory.

In addition, a postâ€”editor program is being programmed for
operation on FORTRAN II output. It will editxthe binary output
tape and three BCD output files into LLS form such that:

1. COMMON statements can be set or modified at load time,

and extensive recompilations due to COMMON statement changes

should be unnecessary.

2. With some constraints, dimensions of arrays, in COMMON

can be made symbolic. This feature will be of great benefit,

for example, with matrix subprograms.
