Dear Professor Morse:

T have recently heard of your program involving the use of
the I.B.M. 704 data processing machine by researchers of
acceptable educational institutions. I would like to know the
details of how our college may become a participating member and
how application can be made.

Also, I am interested in the fellowship program offered to
student assistants who might qualify to learn to use the 704.
Please feel free to write or call me concerning the College and
its qualifications to participate in this program.

Thank you in advance for any information you can send me which
will help answer these questions.

Sincerely yours,
Fr and- w. Ary

Frank W. Gery
Head of the Department
