Proof. Suppose R is the small vector of a mediant ¢. Then any
neighbor operation with R “in the middle” is valid. Take in particular
(PBS): We can apply the neighbor operation only a limited number of
times, e. 5.,

(since the operation decreases p1(> O) by Ir, i each time). Now if (350‘)
is still a mediant, the small vector must be Q (because it is no longer “It”
and yet 122 and iszi now exceed [r2 I). We therefore apply (PQS) as
long as possible until we obtain a ¢(""‘)- This process must terminate since
the operations (PQS) and (PBS) each decrease p1 (> 0) by i qri 01‘ ini

We are now ready to handle the non-mediant quadruples. We are again
confronted with a multitude of special cases that would be tedious to give in
detail. We therefore ﬁrst make use of limiting sets.

Outline of proof. An actual listing of the twenty-four different t nes
of ¢ according to the relative magnitudes of the rows (see 16) would show
that only two types are mediants. The remaining twenty-two} types reveal
limiting sets on inspection, but the amount of space required to handle the
inequalities in writing is almost prohibitive. It should be clear however that

present algorithm can best be brought out by considering the hypercomplex
