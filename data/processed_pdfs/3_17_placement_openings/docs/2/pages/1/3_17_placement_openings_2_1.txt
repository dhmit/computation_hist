OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT

July 1, 1960

To Members of the Faculty and Staff:

High speed computers are playing an increasingly important
role in the research and teaching activities of the Institute. 1In
recognition of the problem of planning for future needs 1n this area,
an Ad Hoc Faculty Committee has been set up to study both the
orientation and likely magnitude of our computation problems. The
Committee will be composed of Professors Albert G. Hill (Chairman),
Philip M. Morse, Robert M. Fano, and Jerome B. Wiesner. To assist
them a study group of faculty and DSR members has been formed under
the direction of Professor Herbert M. Teager. This group will be
actively engaged over the summer and fall months collecting and
Ã©valuating information.

All members of the M.I.T. community having computation
problems are invited to bring them before either the faculty
committee or the working group.
