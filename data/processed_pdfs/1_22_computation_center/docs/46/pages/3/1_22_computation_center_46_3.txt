1,0 Introduction

The purpose of this two-day work session was to clarify the
dimensions on the steel plates in the floor of the MIT 704 Calculator Room
(26-156). In addition, the special engineering representatives Ifrom Poughkeepsie
were available to clarify the previously-submitted drawings (JIBM #680828-10, 20,
30, 40, and 50) concerning the duct comnections to the following six machines:

1) 704 Central Processing Unit (3 duct connections),
2) 733 Magnetic ﬁrum (1 duct connection),

3) 736 Power Uunii (3 duct comnections),

4) 737 Magnetic CORE Unit (2 duct connections), .

5) 737 Magnetic CORE Unit (2 duct comnnections),

6) 741 Power Unit (3 duct conmnections).

The principal source of confusion arose as a result of the fact that
all of the existing Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill drawings (R-45, R-46, A-23,
etc.) have incorrectly-scaled information regarding the location of holes in
the steel plates as well as the location of underflioor duct openings. After
many hours of fruitless laboyr, it was decided to sbandon using Skidmore, Owings
and Merrill drawvings end proceed with "on-spot” field measurcments and exect
site locations. Naturally this is a oot regrefable situation, and ome which
could bave been avoided had properly-scaled drawings been prepared by the
architect. Apparently one source of common difficulty is the confua;on
