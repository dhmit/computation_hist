The scope subprograms DISPLA and SCALE, PL@T and GRID have been
revised. for the IBM 7090, Column binary decks for these sub-
programs may be obtained in Room 26-058,

Set Density

If a programmer should give a set density instruction
followed by a reset data channel, there must be a delay of 3.5

ms so that the set density instruction will be effective, For
example :

SDN %%

AXT 800, 1

TIX *,1,1:} 3, ms.
