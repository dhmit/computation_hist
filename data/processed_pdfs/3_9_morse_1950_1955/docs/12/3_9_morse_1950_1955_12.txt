I have just received a telephone call from Dr. Hurd, He will arrive at
the Institute on Wednesday, December 15, at © a.me (he could not make it on
the 13th). You will recall that we intended to have a group meeting attended
by Professors Stratton, Floe, Morse, Dr. Hurd, and myself sometime during the
morning of the 15the Perhaps we should schedule a meeting of M.I.T. personnel
(Stratton, Floe, Morse, Verzuh) sometime on Monday, at which time we gould
acquaint the administration with our thoughts on this matter prior to meeting
with Dr. Hurd on Wednesday.

I shall be in ‘hiladelphie attending the ACM Computer Conference on
December 8 « 10. I expect to see a number of the new computers which are to
be exhibited at that time «= IBM 650, and the consolidated Magnetic Drum Calculator.
I shall spend some time with Dr. Hurd during this session and will have obtained
additional information regarding present delivery schedules, outstanding machine
ordersy etce, which have a direct bearing on our meeting on Wednesday, December 15,
