a result, it is estmtod that only about $8,900 will have been
spent by Jun. 39, 1957. staff members, which were to have been
to this project, have been continued on the Whirlwind
feet until the change-over, and most of then will not be trans-
_‘ «1 until summer. It is therefore proposed that the project be
' imed until June 30, 1958, with an additional grant of only
15,000, so that in the full year of full operation, July 1957 to
Jame 1958, we can operate at the rate of $35,000 a year, as
estimated in last year's forecast. Estimated details of budget
are appended, together with excerpts from the original proposal.

work of the Solid State Theory Group under Prof. J. c. Slatesh
and the large—shower calculations of Prof. Bruno Rossi. The
npteorology group unﬂe’r Prof. Gharney, recently moved here from
Princeton where their work was initiated by Von Neunann, is
planning to use a substantial amount of machine time, and will
require the advice and help of our staff to program their various
calculations. We will be assisting the Harvard Observatory staff
in calculating satellite orbits in preparation for, and during,
the IGY satellite "shoots“. Dr. S. Ulam of Los Alamos, who has
been a Visiting Fellow to the Center this year, has been assisting

Dartmouth Mathematics Department (one of the New England colleges
participating in our program) will be here next year and will be
interested in eeveloping machine logic and in further investiga-
