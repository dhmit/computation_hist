REM REMARKS

The function of the translation phase is to read program decks

in sequence from the RUN INPUT TAPE, to assemble them, and to record them

in binary form on the BINARY INPUT TAPE., The direction cards, SAP, FTN,

BIN, and PMD, serve as title cards for the decks and identify the kind of

deck that follows,

The variable field of a title card must contain a title which

the user
j S9SIBN8 o the deck. "Mis 4116 miss have one of the following
orms :

(a) Axd d is a digit
(b) A*dldz d1 and dz are digi<s
(c) -4 A does not end in *d or *d.d

L
where A denotes an arbitrary set of Hollerith characters (not containing

blanks)., The operator program will modify these titles as follows

(a) Axd becomes A*Qd

b Ax

(b) dld2 becomes A*dld2
(c) A becomes A*Q0

and retain the last 24 characters of the modified title to identify the
deck,
Thus the titles
A and A*0Q and A*Od
A*1 and A*0l

are equivalent,

The title which the user assigns to a deck during translation
time can be used on‘suitable direction cards during the remainder of the
run to refer to the deck,.

The Direction Cards, RUN, TER, and EOT
Every run must begin with a RUN direction card
RUN M100-5-1NOV58
whose variable field contains a title which the user assigns to the run,
Every run must terminate with a TER direction card
TER M100-5-1NOVS58
whose variable field contains the run title. If a TER card occurs during
translation time it will terminate the run and initiate translation time
for the next run,

The EOT card is recorded at the end of the RUN INPUT TAPE by
the computer operator and does not concern the user,

It is possible for a run to consist entirely of translation
time (e.,g., a user wishes only to assemble a SAP deck) but in general
runs proceéd from translation time to operation time, The transition

occurs whenever the translation phase encounters one of the following

direction cards on the RUN INPUT TAPE,
