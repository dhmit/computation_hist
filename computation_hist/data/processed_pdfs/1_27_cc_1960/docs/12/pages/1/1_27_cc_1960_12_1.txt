Time Sharing Project:

MIT's computational needs are clearly growing. This
growth is occuring both in the direction of expanding the
scope and complexity of current areas of computer applica—
tion, and in the direction of opening up entirely new areas
of application. In addition, there is an ever present re—
quirement of making a computer more easy to use and access—
able; and minimizing the turnover time between problem for—
mulation and answer. It is the overall purpose of the time—
sharing project to apply new techniques, hardware and sys—
tems for the resolution of these apparently conflicting re-
quirements. The basic approach of the project is to apply
multiprogramming (time sharing) techniques to a large com-
puter.

If we first consider the present areas of computer ap—
plication, the larger problems are taxing the 704 computer
in several respects. First, is the requirement for longer
running times in blocks. Second, there is an increasing use
of programs wherein human decision is an important part of
the overall man—machine system. Since human decision can be

"quite slow in comparison to that of a machine, such usage
can result in a very low utilization of machine time.

Future areas of application are moving in the direction
of widespread usage of the computer as a direct aid for edu—
cation, larger and longer problems in simulation and optima—
tion, and real—time data processing. Each user would, of
course, like to have the full capacity of a very large sys—
tem at his immediate beck and call. This is clearly im—
possible in terms of their conflicting requirements for
large blocks of machine time, with perhaps a fairly small
duty cycle of machine time required within that block,
