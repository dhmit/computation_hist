- for the IBM Research Associate recently appointed for the 1959-60

The increasing use of the IBM 704 Computer at M. I.T. by
the New England colleges both as an educational device and a research
tool has been very encouraging to IBM, and we are delighted that
Boston College is having an active part in it as represert ed by this
