MODULAR FUNCTIONS, DEFINED BY
PERTURBATION MAPPINGS“

HARVEY COHN

1. Introduction. There seem to be at least two different methods
of deﬁning invariants 1(2) for Ihichsian groups, such as the modular
group, given by the transformations

(1) z —>zr = (az + b)/(cz + d), ad — be = l,
where a, b, c, d are integers. The function 1(2) is to satisfy the con-
dition
(2) I(z') = 1(2) for Imz > 0.
The ﬁrst method is to deﬁne the so-called Eisenstein series,

formed with terms arising from the denominators of the transforma-
tions, such as

(3) Emu) = 2qu (pa + q)“

summed (once) over each reduced fraction p/q (positive, negative,
0/1, and 1/0). It is easily seen that for even m g 4 the series con-
verges absolutely to a sum not identically zero and, from the con~
vergence,

(4) Em(zT) = (02 + d)'"E,,.(z).

To form a genuine invariant (with property (2)), we take a combina-
tion [3] such as

(5) J (a) = Rho/[1713(2) - 1352(2)],

giving J (z), the well-known invariant. It turns out that all in-
variants are single-valued functions of J (z).

The second method, due to Dedekind [1], is to start out with the
fundamental domain, in the z—plane, and let [(2) he an actual mapping
function that identiﬁes the portions of the boundary that correspond
