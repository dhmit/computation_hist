Dear Professor Morse:

In sccordance with our telephone conversation, this is to
inform you of the several inquiries which I have received from various
members of the 1.B.M. Corporation concerning the possible cooperation
between I.B.M. and ¥N.1.T. on our long range computational program.

Apparently Br. Hurd has been ghting serious consideration to
this matter and has discussed it with several high echelon people
within I.2.M. @ince our meeting on December 15th I have seen him
several times, and each time he inquires "When will I.B.M. receive
the M.I.T. request?” As a matter of fact, our intentions for re-
questing gratis equipment is generally known at the local office
level, and I have been asked by the local I.B.M. personnel when
action will be taken by M.I.T.

Yesterday while attending the Registrar's Conference at
the Sheraton Plaza, I had an interesting conversation with
Mr. E. C. Behroedel, who is with the Education Bepartment of the
I.B.M. Corporation, and this matter was again brought up by him,
The current acute manpower requirements in the EBPM field were
discussed and several possibilities were suggested. Because of the
nature of his comments, I will discuss these with you at our next
meeting.

I hesitate to repeatedly bring up this matter; however,
it is costing us money and possibly personnel which would cause an
aonte situation in the near future. The attached statement contains
some of the pertinent information regarding our expenditures for the
special-purpose machines ~- ~- CPC and 604, and I feel it will serve os
useful background material in our discussions.

Sincerely yours,
