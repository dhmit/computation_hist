the computational equipment used by the Center,

The computing equipment of the Center, which will be
furnished by the IBM Corporation, will primarily consist of
Apzcaﬁﬁery peripheral equipment.

This machine is an up-to~date, fast, general-purpose

a 704 computer and the

electronic digital computer. The basic machine code includes
o¥er 80 instructions,includinﬁ those for arithmetic operations
with floating-point numbers. The basic operating time is
24 microsecondg for most ingtructionsywith a normal maximum
of 240 microseconds. The 704 to be gnstalled will have a
magnetic core memory with a storage capacity of 8192 woréds,
ALad
each word containing 36 binaryﬂgéﬁs. (The storage capacity
will be incressed to 32,768 registcrszééssaﬁ 1958,) The
computer will also havc,as an additional storage devicera
magnetic drum with a 8192 worfl capacity. As with most modern
computers, magnetic tape is used Bot%i%or additional storage
and for input-output requérements. Théminstallation will
have 1% tape units, (at most 10 under computer control),
each unit storing up to a maximum of 900,000 words.
