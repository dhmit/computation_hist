re " RENEW YL NR
v (HE vy 3 A !

The purpose of this memorandum 18. to sresent a rate
structure for the Card Programmed Calculator which evolved
8s & consequence of our meeting on October RZ, 192453, It
is proposed that this rate structure be effective for the
period July 1, 1953 until fur ther notice,

Although a number of operating clans were discussed,
the following recommendations were made at this Resting!

1.) The monthly machine rental charges for the CPC
{including two 941 units, and two auxiliary
machines) is $2400, This figure is the primary
shift charge and it includes a 20% educational
discount granted by the 18M Corporation.

Z.) The monthly coei of $2400 is to be recovered by
assessing a charge ef $15 per hour for each hour
"of scheduled machine use, (It is believed that
a charge for scheduled hours will minimize the
“lost ¥ CPC pachine time and, hence, increase
overall operating efficiency).

3.) The method of cost z2llecation is Intended to
assess CFC malntenance costs to the particular
user scheduled te use ihe machine &i the (lize
it "breaks down", Operaticnal experience during
Lhe past 10 months reveals thet aes much as RE
hours per month may be required for TEST SERVICE,
and PREVENTATIVE Maintenance of the CFC.

8) Net average DAYSFIFT hours = 160-28 = 132 hrs of month
b) Minimum Mo, of usage hours required to recover
cost = 160 hrs./month, i.e. 160 hr, x $15 = $2400,

c) 18,

e) Thesis Research
are spefdfic subjects which demand CPC machine time. Unfore
tunately, clients in these categories do HOT have necessary
funds ts pay the §15 per hour machine charge.

1t was recormended that the above subjects and clients
be allowed use of the CFC free of charge subject to the
following restrictions

a8) Approval for machine use is to be determined by
recommendations received from the Machire Computation
Committee and Fe 3 Verzuh,

b) Educational Research of this type employing the CPC
should preferably be performed at night whenever possible.

7.) Scheduling of CPC Machine Time

A schedule of CPC machine usage will be prepared each
Friday for the forthcoming week. The principal ussrs of thre
CPC (sectiun 4) will be given preferential treatment as fap
as TAYEHIFT hours are concerned, However, the zssignment of

Rach1ge time after 5PM will be performed with due regard to
item 6; end, in particular, an effort will be made to accome
edate other paying clients whe are nct regular customers,
Furthermore, it must be understocd that reguler customers are
not to be allowed exclusive use of the EPC

8.) Operating Personnel

 

Turing the past fiscal parted, Me. Co, Connors and F, 8B,
Van Wyk were carried on the period, of the Air Force Contract
{DIC B-7019) and acted as coerdinators for CPC Self-Service

operation, During the present fisesl period, provision will

be made for paying the salaries of two persons from the
Cperations Resssrch Contract and these individusls wil) pe
trained te act as coordinators, ye

However, the proposed mode of night shift o;eration

 ¢emands thet a competent individual with 1B background be

hired to act as coordinator during the night shift. As yet,
this man ie pot available,

9.) Self-Service Operational Methods

During the past 10 menths, the staff of the Office of
Statistical Services have compiled a group of Five (8)
different general purpose control pénels to permit more effec
tive use of the CFC on & self-service basis, Correspondingly,
five different operational manualst S«10, S«11, S=12Z, E13,
and S~14 have been writlen and .rinted for general elrculation,
The avallability of these control panels and ssseciated
Manuals is largely respensible for the current mode of effecw
tive SELF-SERVICE CPC operation,

Furthermore, & second set of Board Wo. 1 has been
prepared to pernlt use of other CPC machines in the Boston
area, i! the need should arise.

10} Furchase orders aud Billing Procedures

a) Regular clients must submit purchase orders covering
intended CPC usage in an amount determined by the
new rate of £15 per machine hour,

b) Non-Regular cilents will submit purchase orders
