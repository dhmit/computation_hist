considerable effect on the thermal conductivity. Qualitative
statements of these effects have been supported by observed
derivations from the theoretically expected values. Previous
experimental data have largely been reported as minor parts
of more general investigations with commercial refractories
for which the pore characteristics and solid conductivity were
difficult to define, measure, or control.

In this series (Part VIII) Loeb has derived some rather
simple equations relating thermal conductivity with the
porosity and size, shape, and emissivity of the pores. In the
present experimental study it was desired to test this and
other theoretical relationships by preparing samples having a
known solid-phase conductivity and a known size, shape,
orientation, and emissivity of pores.

In addition to the experimental verification of the theoreti-
cal relationships (which all involve fairly crude assumptions),
the applicability of these results to practical systems will be
shown.

Il. Literature Review

Of the previously published theories the most generally
employed are the expressions by Russell' and by Eucken.?
Both were derived from Maxwell's relation for conductors
and resistors. They treat isometric pores (spherical or
cubical) with equal dimensions in all three axes. Although
they differ in form, they lead to similar results. The effect of
porosity depends on the volume pore fraction and the ratio
between the conductivity of solid and air. The radiation
portion of heat transfer is treated as additive to the thermal
conductivity of air, thus lowering the ratio, (), between the
thermal conductivity of solid and air and in this way in-
creasing the conductivity of the porous aggregate. These
relations and that of Loeb are given in Table I.

Ribaud® used the same isometric cubical type of pores in his
derivation of a quite different tvpe of formula of two com-
ponents: the expression for heat transmission through a cell
of air and for heat flow through solids.

The experimental values differed from the calculated values
in most cases.

A number of surveys including the effect of porosity have
appeared in the literature.* Those by Austin*® and by
Barrett® are the most comprehensive.  Austin summarized
the established principles, compared them, correlated the
data in the literature, and added measurements on silica and
diaspore brick. The variation of the conductivity with
porosity was linear in diaspore brick, but the silica brick
showed a deviation from the linear relationship. The correla-
tion between the calculated values postulated by Russell’s
theory and measured values was found to be satisfactory.
One of the most serious drawbacks in this work was the lack of
any knowledge of the conductivity of “pure solid” as a base
for the calculations. Austin had to extrapolate the more or
less straight-line relationship between the porosity and
thermal conductivity, obtained by measurement of a few
samples with known porosity, to zero volume pore fraction.
In this way he introduced the values of 0.007 c.g.s. units for
the conductivity of pore-free diaspore at 300°C., which he
then used in the calculation of Alundum refractories.

Barrett,*® in a comprehensive survey in which he dis-
cussed the influence of voids on over-all thermal conductivity,
stressed the point of orientation of pores or direction of heat
flow. He also noted that there are differences up to 209 in
the conductivity of porous clay insulating brick in the direc-
tion at right angles to different faces. Russell’s expression
was used, and the results obtained on a group of clay brick
showed good agreement. On the other hand, the diatoma-
ceous brick showed remarkable deviations owing to the
difference in structure and pore sizes. Barrett did not
recommend the use of Russell’s expression for systems with
larger pores (‘“radiation holes’’) exceeding 0.3 cm. Finck?®
observed conductivities twice as high in the case of fibers
oriented parallel as compared with fibers oriented perpen-
dicular to the heat flow.

Other experimental investigations carried out in this
field!®8 provide a confirmation of the very general con-
cusions of Eucken's and Russell’s theories. On the other
side, the available data reveal the necessity of a new approach
to further variables. Most previous workers®~¢ found the
linear relationship between porosity and thermal conductivity
to be approached, with small pores having more effective
insulating power than larger air spacesi(®) 6(b-d s=7) at Jow
and at intermediate temperatures. Further analysis has not
been possible primarily because of the lack of experimental
data for well-defined and suitably controlled samples.

Il. Experimental

The experimental program consisted of preparing samples
having a well-defined systematic variation in pore size and
shape and of known thermal conductivity and surfgce
emissivity. The major portion of the research was que@
out with alumina as the solid phase since its conductivity 1S
well known from previous measurements in this laboratory,
its emissivity has been determined,’ and it is amenable to
specimen fabrication. Some measurements were also mgde
on nickel and graphite to determine the effects of varymg
emissivity,
