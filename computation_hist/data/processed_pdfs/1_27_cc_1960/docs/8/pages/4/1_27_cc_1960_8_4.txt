M.I.T. Computation Growth Page 1‘.

All of these seemingly disparate areas have very much
in common. First of all, they no longer are primarily com-
putational in nature. In general, they all have 3 1°31
largo information moccasin; and retrieval aspect. That is
to say that they all require almost a random access to a
huge amount of information and spend much time in reorganiz-
ing that information. The penalty for lesser access times
and smaller core memory is an inordinate cost in machine
time. Secondly, these areas are all pointing in the direc-
tion of not only computing an answer, but in repeating the
process many times in order to gain a best answer and
eventually toward gaining an insight into why it is the best
answer. Clearly, a large number of small machines cannot
answer this need. What is needed is a very large capacity,
high speed computer that has large information processing
capabilities and can be time shared, 1. e. multiprogramed
such as a stretch class computer. The stretch has not only
far greater memory and computational speed than a 701%, but
in addition, is a far more efficient information processor
than the 70“ which was designed to handle only numbers, and
is quite poor at finding, or rearranging information.

Let us examine a. few of the research areas that are
currently hampered, and whose future growth is out of the
question unless the general capacity that we have discussed
is provided.

Weather prediction for a. hemisphere of earth, using a
very rough model takes on the order of 21% hours of 70h time
for a 24 hour prediction. The reason for this is that the
model must take into account topographical features, heat
balances, moisture contents, etc. at many many points, both
at and above the earth's surface. Long range forecasting is
thus clearly impossible on the 7014. As a result, progress
in this area must remain slow until a faster machine is
available.
