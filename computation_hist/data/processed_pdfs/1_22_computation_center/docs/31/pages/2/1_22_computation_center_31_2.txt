P dx

Here m is & function taking 4 input quaﬁtities and producing '
3 outputs f,g,h and k each have 2 inputs and 1 output. The
desired composition has 4 1nputs anid 2 outputs.

The guestion 18: ﬁow Shali weé deﬁcribé the composed
function, It 18 proposed that this be done a8 follows.
First, we redraw the dlagram 86 that the fiunctisons appear in
1inear order.

 

Then we make the convention that when a function which
nominally has m inputs and n outputs 1s applied to P inputs
where P > m the function is considered to operate on the first
m inputs, the remainder belng passed unchanged., With this
ouestion it i1s necessary to have a means of selecting certain
of an ordered set of variables and reordéring them. We propose
to do this by certain psuedo operators called PI operators. In
the present case we vwrite our composed function.

V = FeG-PI(2413) -H* PI(24213)°-K°PI(23123)°M

Here we use "periods” for denoting composition. The PI pseudo-
operator PI(23123) takes 3 variables as input and produces 5

as output. If there were more than 9 variables the above

notation could not be used unambiguously So we propose the
conventlon that Af numbers larger than 9 occur the pseudo-operation

be written PI(1,2,17) but that if no commas at all occur the
digits represent separate numbers.
