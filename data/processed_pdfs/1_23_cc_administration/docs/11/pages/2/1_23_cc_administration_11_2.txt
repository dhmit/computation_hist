Anticipating the turning over of Whiriwind to Lincoln, no
additionasl moneys were requested for NSori-60 for this f£iscal year. Much
of the gctivity under thia contract has been related to closing out the
Whiriwind part of the work, though scme research started on Whirlwind has
been transferred to the 704 in order to reach satiafactory compiletion of
the work. Because of the tapering-o0ff of activity under this contract,
it now appears that about $30,000 will still be unaxpendod by June 30,
1958, It also appears likely that some of the more long-range research
projects of the sort, supported by this contract in the past will still
be going on,

For example, cosmic-ray measuréments and particle accelerztor
measurements, carried out in the Laboratory of Nuclear Science, are
coming to use digital computers to analyze the data, Ve have been
cooperating with them to 1nveatigate methoda whereby such.neasurementa
can be recorded directly om cards or tape and progranmod so that the
analysis can be carried out directly by the machine without further
manual transeription of data., This work will continue, as will the
investigation of various means of displaying the results of the machine
calculations. Other long-rnnge investigations, such as that on
artiticial intelligence, also come within the scope of the task orders
for NSori-60,

it is therefore proposed that the Office of Naval Research be
requested to continue Contract NSori-g0 for the year beginning July 1, 1938,
without additional funds, to continue support of long-range research of the
sort described in the Contract's present task orders until the balance of
the funds is exhausted. These funds would be used chiefly for persomnel
galaries and might be allocated as follows:

Senior Mathematician (1 year) : $ 9,000
2 Technicians or Programmers 11,000

(at about $5,500 per year each) 557335
Overhead, at 45% 2,000
Travel 500
Incidentals (production of reports, 500

office supplies, etc.)

TOTAL $30,000

If the unexpended balance on June 30, 1858, turns out to be less
or more than the ostimated $30,000, this budget could be modified accordingly
to run for a shorter or longer time than an additionsl year,
