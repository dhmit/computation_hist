Dear Dr. Morse,

Re I do not remember whether you met my wife at
the meeting-at Ax; you probably did at the receiption.
You will be sorry to know that she died on 17th August,
after a very distressing disease which we 211 hoped might
be beaten, even up to the end.

Because of the very great shock, 1 have been
advised to make a very great change for at least a short
time, and am therefore flying to Monvreal on 9ti. veptember
for three weeks y=before—retuTTingto-take up-my-appointmerns
with the University of Hull.

During my period in Cenada, I would verymmuch
like to meke a short visit to your part of the world and if
you are available, to see you. T would particularly like to
discuss educational matters, more especially as I have been
asked to organise a one year post graduate course in Operational
Research- for the University of Hull, have done all the
preliminary organising and start in earnest in October.

My address in Canada will be :

c/e A.F. Hanly,
615 Carleton Avenue, West Mount. Montreal.

Yours sincerely,

Nw SS wan
