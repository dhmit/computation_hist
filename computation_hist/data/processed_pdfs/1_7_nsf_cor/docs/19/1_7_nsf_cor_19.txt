SUBJECT: laterial for National Science Foundation Proposal

 

In accordance with our discussions regarding the proposal to 36?,
I am enclosing the following intonation.

machine eminent 2; £22 ILLT. Eutation Center

 

 

 

The ILLT. amputation Center will have a Type 704 Electronic
Data Processing llschine with the following machine complement:
12 magnetic tape units, 2 magnetic coax storage units containing a
total of 8,000 words, 1 magnetic drum unit containing 4,000 words
of storage, the usual on-_l____ine punched card reader, alphabetic printer,
and punched card recorder—"I. as well as the 3 o_i_£-line magnetic tape
controlled printer, magnetic tape controlled card punch, and punched
card-to-magnetic tape converter, respectively. Total machine
"cmplenent net monthly- rental is slightly over $45,000. In addition
to the 704, there will be 10 auxiliary punched card machines including
card punches, collators, sortere, reproducers, interpreters, and the

Type 407 Accounting Machine. The aggregate machine rental is in
excess of $ 50,000 per month.

the Type 704 EDP]! unit is one of the fastest large-scale
commercial computers available today. Since the ILIJI'. installation
will be but one of many in the field, techniques, programs, and
numerical procedures developed for this machine will be of universal use.

Biographical Information

 

Dr. F. I. Verzuh, Director of Statistical Services, has been
connected with the operation of ILLT. computational work since 1940.
In this capacity he has had considerable experience with. the utilization
of various analog computing equipment -- differential analyzers, etc. ,

as well as a complete line of digital machines ranging from the ma
Type 601 through the Type 704.

He received a 3.5. degree in Electrical Engineering from the
University of Denver in 1940, a ELS. degree in Electrical Engineering

from M.I.T. in 1946, and a scD. degree in Electrical Engineering from
u.I.T. in 1952.

In the office of statistical Services he is concerned with the
utilization of 1m punched card equipment to 1u1fill the need of the
1.1.12 educational and research projects. In this connection a
number of research contracts have been executed for various branches
of the armed services. In July, 1955 he was placed in charge 01 the
operation 01 the Whirlwind Computer -- the high-speed machine currently
used for scientific research at the Institute. Again, several research
projects are being conducted using this computer as a basic tool.
