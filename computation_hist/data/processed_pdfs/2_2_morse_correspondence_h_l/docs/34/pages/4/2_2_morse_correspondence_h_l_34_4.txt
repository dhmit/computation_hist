served sets of reflectance and transmission. The values
thus found were used to estimate the optical constants
according to Egs. (13) and (14), which in turn were
substituted into Egs. (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6) to
compute the reflectance and transmission. As indicated
in the introduction, the difference between the observed
and calculated set of reflectance and transmission is a
test of the validity of the approximation. In Table I are
listed four examples of results obtained with the Whirl-
wind I test program. It happens that for this test run
only the root ¢/eo>1 of Eq. (10) was taken. Since the
experimental error in Woltersdorff’s data is at least
0.005, Eqgs. (9) and (10) are very suitable for the
evaluation of his and similar data.

Since there are two dielectric constants fitting each
set of reflectance and transmission measurements, there
are two sets of optical constants as well. This is demon-
strated in Table IV, which lists the results for data
reported by Woltersdorff.> These results will be dis-
cussed in Sec. III. It is appropriate to this section on
numerical analysis to point out a relationship between
the two sets of solutions. If Eqgs. (9) and (10) were to
hold exactly, the two sets of solutions would have the
same conductance, and would have dielectric constants
with the same absolute value of {(e/e—1)}, but
opposite sign. If the two sets are labeled with respective
subscripts “1” and “2,” (ucoa),= (ucsa), and {(e1/€0)
—1}={1—(es/e)}. From Eqgs. (7) and (8) it follows
that 121k1=712k2 and 1ll2+}'122—1=k12+k22+1. The re-
sults shown in Table TV were calculated exactly, using
Egs. (1) through (8). Where the ratio of film thickness
to wavelength is sufficiently small, as for instance for
sample Sb 4 and sample Al 19, the relations between the
two solutions derived from the approximate Egs. (9)
and (10) are obeyed fairly well, but for thicker films,
such as Bi 12, there is a noticeable deviation.

The approximation n=#%, which is based on the
assumption {(ucoa)/(2ra/N)}2>(¢/€)? has also been

tested on Whirlwind I. Results of this test are shown in
Table II, in which the set of approximate results, labeled
' and %/, is listed together with both sets of accurately
computed results. ‘“Accurately computed” results are
results corresponding to a set of reflectance and trans-
mission differing from the observed values by no more
than the expected experimental error.

While for massive conductors n=~% at these wave-
lengths, the results of the accurate calculations show
that for thin films # and & are very different. As pre-
dicted, the product nk is nearly the same for the accu-
rately and “approximately” computed sets of constants.
The accurately calculated results show that the assump-
tion that led to the expression #=2k is not valid for these
films. To demonstrate this the quantities {ucoa/
(2ra/\)} and (¢/e&) are listed in Table III as found
accurately on Whirlwind I for the samples given in
Table II. It is seen that only for Al 12 at 32.8u is the
inequality {ucoa/(2ma/\)}>>(e/€0)* valid. This is also
the only one for which, according to Table II, n~k.

The values of AR and AT in Table IT, used to indicate
the accuracy of the approximation n==2, seem to show
that the approximation is not too bad here. In Sec.
IT-B it was predicted that a whole family of optical
constants obeying the condition 7= const. would give
a reasonable fit. The three pairs of constants given for
each sample and each wavelength in Table II form
such a family. Two of the three pairs, namely (n,,k;)
and (ns,k,;) fit the observed data exactly, while the
third, namely (»’,%’), fits the data moderately well but
by no means exactly. The values of AR and AT given in
Table II show that varying » and % subject to the
condition nk= constant does not greatly alter R and 7.
The conclusion from these data is that the individual
optical constants of thin films do not equal each other,
and that they cannot be determined with as great
accuracy as can their product »nk. This conclusion is in
agreement with the one drawn in Sec. II-B from an
analysis of the influence of the dielectric constant on
the optical behavior of thin films in the infrared. In
summary, then, it is proposed that the infrared proper-
ties of thin films are better described by their electrical
than by their optical constants. Of the former, the con-
ductance per square is very significant and accurately
determinable. Since the optical constants are functions
of both electrical constants, the uncertainty regarding

the dielectric constant is reflected in both optical con-
stants as is clearly shown in Table II.

In conclusion, attention should be drawn to the
derivatives of the optical constants with respect to the
reflectance and transmission listed in Table IV. These
derivatives relate the expected inaccuracies in the
calculated optical constants to the probable experi-
mental errors in reflectance and transmission. For the
infrared measurements listed here these derivatives are
very large indicating that the accuracy in determining
the individual optical constants is not very great. The
derivatives of the conductivity and dielectric constants
can be found by differentiating Eqs. (7) and (8):

——( —)=n S (16)
OR,T \ ¢ dR.T . ORT
d dra dk n
————(uwa)=———(n—+k ) (17)
oR,T A oR,T OR,T

The factor 4ra/\ in Eq. (17) causes the derivatives of
ucaa to be small. The derivatives of the dielectric con-
stant are large when the derivatives of the optical con-
stants are. This once more demonstrates that the con-
ductance per square can be determined with greater
accuracy in the infrared than can the dielectric and
optical constants. This is in agreement with the con-
clusions of the preceeding paragraph.

III. THE VARIATION OF CONDUCTIVITY WITH
WAVELENGTH IN THE INFRARED: AN
ANALYSIS OF WOLTERSDORFEF’S
RESULTS

Harris and Loeb? have shown that there are at least
two causes of the variation of conductance with wave-
length in thin metal films. These are the ‘“condenser
effect” and the “relaxation effect.” The condenser
effect is due to nonconducting regions or ‘‘scratches”
which can intercept electric current. Such imperfections
act as condensers that have an infinite impedance
toward direct currents, but whose impedance decreases
with increasing frequency. Thus the effective conduc-
tance in the infrared tends to decrease with increasing
wavelength if there are imperfections acting as con-
densers. The relaxation effect causes the induced elec-
tron motion to lag behind an imposed radiation field,
so that the amount of energy absorbed is less than it
would be if the field and the current were in phase.
This lag increases with increasing frequency. Therefore
the effective conductance increases with increasing
wavelength in the infrared. This variation is given® by
the equa‘ion

(ucogott/ucaa) = 14+7*(2mwc/N)?, (18)

where oy, is the direct current conductivity.

Both effects are thought to be responsible for the
“anomalies” in the film conductances reported by
Woltersdorff.5 All of Woltersdorff’s complete data (in-

cluding values for R, T, a, and \) have been evaluated on
Whirlwind I. Of these some did not satisfy inequality
(11). The results for the rest are presented in Table IV.

Figure 1 shows plots of the reduced resistance per
square of film, 1/ucoa, plotted versus (¢/\)? for the bis-
muth samples. The results are consistent with Eq. (18),
and the dc resistivity and relaxation time have been
computed for each bismuth sample from the slopes and
intercepts of the lines in Fig. 1. The results are listed
in Table V. The values found for r are but slightly less
than corresponding values for massive metals, for which

When R and T are plotted against A, as was done by
Woltersdorff, curves exhibing maxima and minima are
obtained, in contrast to the straight line obtained when
ucaa is plotted against (¢/\N). It appears that Wolters-
dorff’s anomaly of poor conductors is actually the
relaxation effect. The calculation of pg* was made
with the assumption that uc=puec=377 ohms, where u,
is the permeability of vacuum. Since bismuth is dia-
magnetic 4 may be less than uo. A lower assumed value
of u would give rise to a lower value of ps.* and thus to
better agreement between pg.* and p** than that given
in Table V.

their results, because the two equations are then divided into
each other.
