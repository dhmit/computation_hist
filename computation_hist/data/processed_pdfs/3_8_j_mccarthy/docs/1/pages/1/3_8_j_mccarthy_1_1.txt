Subject: Various Methods of Reducing the Pressure on the
Computation Cenfer

l. Nature of the Pressure. Just before the Christmas holi-
day, there was a two day delay on computer runs. The delay has
been over one day for almost the whole of the semester. This
has seriously affected the rate at which research can be done.
In particular, the flexowriter version of LISP which was essen-
tially ready at the time of the ACM meeting has dragged on all
fall in debugging, and other projects have been equally slowed.
Undoubtedly, the slow service given by the Center has dis-
couraged new users to a considerable extent, and has made a num-
ber of departments and projects want thelr own computers. I do
not belleve that a lot of separate computers is a solution to
the problem because:

1) Computation costs more per unit in small packages as
well as requiring separate programming systems, ete.
2) It will hamper our T0SC or STRETCH plans.

It is8 difficult to estimate the lncrease in effective com-
puter time required to alleviate the queue because the users
who are seriously hampered now will submit more runs if the de-
lay is shorter, and an improvement in service will encourage
more users. We can already use at least double the computation
facilities we have.

2. Get More 704 Time From IBM. I think we should plan to
be using both Saturdays and sundays and all possible third shift
time by late spring.

3. Departmental Quotas on Tlime. Across the board cuts in
time grants favor ose who learn about them in time to exag-
gerate thelr requests., We do not have enough information about

the quality of the researchers requesting time to cut one off
in favor of another.

Suppose a letter were sent to the five largest department-
al users as follows:
