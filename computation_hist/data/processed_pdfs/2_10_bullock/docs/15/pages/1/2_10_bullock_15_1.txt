Dear Dr. Verzuh:

Thank you for the reports for the last four months
listing the New England college use of the 704.

As we agreed in our discussion on November 17,
you will also be giving me a copy of your regular biweekly
summary of the entire usage of the 704. I am sure that these
reports will keep me informed so that I can best assist you
in the entire program of the MIT Computation Center.

Yours very truly,

: gl

M. Loren Bullock
University Representative
