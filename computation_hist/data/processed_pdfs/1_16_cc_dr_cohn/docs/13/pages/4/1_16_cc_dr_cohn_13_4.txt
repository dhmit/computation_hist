Then if a lattice 8* = (“*ul is stable with respect to the function ¢ of free

dimension Q, then an 2 > 0 and an 1, > 0 exist together with Q + 1 n-tUples

Conversely, if a lattice has these properties for some 5, 1] and Q + 1 n-tuplcs
as described, then the lattice is stable.

This is the type of property that Mahler [7] established for certain cases
where his theory of “bounded reducibility" applies. The property is an easy
consequence of the deﬁnition of stability given above. As a simple corollary
we note that when 8* is stable, then for some positive 6, 17, and all '9 ’ gill < h
we have MW) g M(8*) _ 77[53 _ Wl'

Thus, in a sense, M(B*) is a local maximum by virtue of the Q + 1 SPCCiﬁC

ol0+ 1 vertices which contains the origin, if we merely triangulate ‘13, intro-
ducing no new vertices and recalling that the triangulating hyperplanes will not
contain the origin (by the independence property). These Q +1 vertices of
course determine the positively dependent vectors.

The applications that follow (see §9) will stem from the following result;
Let the (inﬁnite) set of vectors {V} of 5" contain vectors arbitrarily close in
direction to 2Q vectors consisting of Q basis vectors and their negatives. We
shall call this latter conﬁguration a unit star. (Compare the “eutactic star” of
Coxeter [2, p. 401].) Suppose that a subsequence of iv} can be selected which
comes increasingly close in direction to any designated one of the 2Q vectors
of the unit star, without coinciding in direction. Let us further suppose that the
last property still holds if we exclude from consideration all vectors of {vi
that lie in an arbitrary set of ﬁxed hyperplanes (through the origin). Then

To see this, ﬁrst note that the projection property is easy to obtain from the
unit star. To establish the independence property we select as our SUbSCt 0‘
M the sequence of vectors chosen by the following inductive procedure:
The vectors are to come increasingly close to the 2Q vectors of the “hit 513" in
some order (without coinciding). Furthermore each vector is selected to be
linearly independent of the set consisting of earlier chosen vectors (if any)
