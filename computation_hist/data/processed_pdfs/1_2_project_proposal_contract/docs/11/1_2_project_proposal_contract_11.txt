Dear Sir:

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology submits
herewith a reviged proposal for extension of the reference contract
to June 30, 1957 at ean additional estimated cost of $20,960,00,

We understand that thls proposal has been the subject of dlscus-
sions between Professor P. M. Morse of MIT and Mr, A, J. Wise

of ONR-MIT, Dr, Carl F, Mukenhaupt of ONR--Beogton, end Dr. F. J.
Weyl of ONR-Waghington.

There follows a summary of expenditures and funds
remaining on the two projects, Whirlwind Operation and Machine
Methods of Computation, which are currently active under the
reference contract:

Project #6345 (Whirlwind Operation) has an unexpended
balance of $97,000 as of November 30, 1955, The ourrent expend-
itures are approximately $10,000 per month, The average "income!
received for Whirlwind usage is approximately $3,000 per month =-
a net expenditure of $7,000 per month, If it is assumed that the
present level of income ($3,000 per month) 1s maintained during
the nineteen-month period December 1, 1955 to June 30, 1957, a
minimum amount, assuming some tapering off, of $119,000 will be
required during this period,

However, for the purpose of establishing an estimate of
unexpended funds on this project as of June 30, 1956, it is esti-
mated that a higher level of income will exist during the remaining
seven months. This may average something above $4,000 a month, On
this basis we estimate that $57,000 of the $97,000 mentioned above
willl remain unexpended as of June 30, 1956, An additional factor
affecting the budget shown on page 4 is the estimated Computer
Income for the one-year period ending June 30, 1957. For this period
only $18,000 in Computer Income has been estimated, This is in-
fluenced by two factors: one being an expected tapering=off of the
use of the Whirlwind machine by other projects, and secondly the
expected beginning of operations under the IEM Type 704 machine,

Pro ject #6915 (Machine Methods of Computation) has an
unexpended balance of ,000 as of November 30, 1955. The current
expenditures are approximately $7,000 per month, If it is assumed
that the present expenditures remain constant, there will be a balance
of approximately $22,000 on June 30, 1956, In accordance with our
present plans’ for terminating the ONR support of this project on
June 30, 1956, there will be certain additional costs extimated at
$7,000 associated with the closing ovt of this project including such

1tems as the preparation of summary reports on the program of
Machine Methods of Computation,

This summary 1s baged on estimates prepared by Prof-
éssor P, M. Morse,

Professor Morse further advigeg that the expected
arrival of an IBM Type 704 Electronic Date Processing Machine at
MIT about January 1, 1957 will create so definite need for addai-
tional funds--to finance the conversion of existing Whirlwind
Programs to Type 704 programs,

Under the proposed plan submitted herewith, Project
#6345 (Whirlwing Operation) would terminate on June 30, 1957,
The task order for thig period would include the usual Whirlwind
Project activities:

1. Research in methods of numerical analysis and
the formulation of scientific problems for machine
solution, together with the training of Personnel
in these methods,

2. Support of the Sclentific and Engineering Applica-
tione Group of Project Whirlwind so a8 to meke the
computer useful and avallable for the above-mentioned
research,

In addition, 1t ig proposed that the following task
order arlsing in connection with the Type 704 EDPM be included:

3. The development of g sul table interpretive Program
and associated coding techniques %o permit effective
implementation of the Type 704 machine.

It is anticipated that a separate project will be get
up to handle the Type 704 utilization within the MIT Computation
Center, and a separate request to the ONR for support of this work
wlll be msde in the near future, In this r'espeet certain
éxperlenced programmers could be made available for transfer to
this new task ag of January 1, 1957. This enticipated transfer
has been taken into account in the budget proposed for Project #6345

The foregoing proposal doss not take into consideration
termination ccsts which may be assoclated with the close out of
this contract ang The possible dispoeition of the Whirlwind Computer,
It is proposed to delay the submittal or any budget for thie matter
untill such tims as disposition of the Whirlwind Computer ig
determined,
