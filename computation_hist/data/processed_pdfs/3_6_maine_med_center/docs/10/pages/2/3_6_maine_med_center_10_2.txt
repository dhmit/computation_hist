where 2 is a unit normal vector, and 15 is an element of surface. The theory
holds for a volume of any shape, but simplifications can sometimes be obtained if
a geometrical figure is used. For the human body, if we assume that the trunk has
the shape of a right cylinder of elliptical or any other cross-section, then Mx

and My are given by integrations over the walls only, and M2 by an integration over

the top and bottom surfaces. We have then

”LII/rf/Vaéé/ (‘9

So far we are unable to find Mz by this method, since the head and legs
are poor approximations to parallel plane surfaces. In order to determine Mz with
ﬁx and My given, it is only necessary to find the vertical angle of the vector, and

this can be found approximately by means of Einthoven's equation or by some similar

vector method.

For a cylinder, equation (2) can be evaluated by measuring the potential

distribution around the cylinder at a given horizontal level. 6 is the angle between

the normal to the surface and the *X axis. The integral of V LI: 9 d! is evaluated

for a number of horizontal levels and these values are plotted against i? . The

area under this curve is the required double integral. b3 is found from eq. (3)

in a similar manner.
