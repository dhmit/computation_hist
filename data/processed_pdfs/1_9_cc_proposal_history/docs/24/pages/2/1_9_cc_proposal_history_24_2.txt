Subject: STATUS OF M.I.T.'S EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM IN AUTOMATIC COMPUTATION
Date: June 1, 1954

As a matter of record in connection with the Wayne University Conference
on Trainine Personnel for the Computing Machine Field, June 22 and 23, 1954,
we have assembled, largely from the M.I.T. catalogue, some information about
various M.I.T. educational activities in the field of automatic computation.

Most of the departments in the Institute are actively interested in
automatic computation as a tool to be taught as an adjunct to other subjects
and to be used in individual research work.

To coordinate Institute activity in the field, the Institute has an '
interdepartmental Committee on Machine Methods of Computation comprising
P.M. Morse, chairman, and H. Feshbach (Physics), C.C. Lin and F.B. Hildebrand
(Mathematics), S.H. Caldwell and J.W. Forrester (Electrical Engineering),
and J.A. Hrones (Mechenical Engineering).

To stimulate research by faculty and students, there are a number of
sponsored research projects bearing on automatic computation, notebly in
the Digital Computer Laboratory and the Dynamic Analysis and Control Labor-
atory.

Financial support is available to promising graduate students in any
department through the Committee on Machine Methods of Computation under the
sponsorship of the Office of Naval Research, and in some departments (e.g.,
Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Physics, Mathematics,
Geology, Business) in connection with the various sponsored research pro-
jects. Scholarship and fellowship is available as for all students.

Laboratory exercises and thesis research projects requiring computing
equipment make use of the facilities described in the following page, which
includes only those facilities which are available at least part time for
unsponsored educational purposes.

Besides thesis research at all levels, informal weekly seminars, and the
short lectures and demonstrations. which are increasingly being incorporated
into undergraduate and graduate subjects in various departments, M.I.T. has
a number of subjects specifically concerned with machine computation &and, of
course, many which pertain to computation in one way or another. Catalogue
listings of most of these subjects are given on the remaining pages of this
note. @LI&T. subjects are numbered with a department number followed by
some serial number (e.g., 6.25 is in Course VI - Electrical Engineering)
where the code is: 2 = Mechanical Engineering; 6 = Electrical Engineering;
8 = Physics; 10 = Chemical Engineeringj 16 = Aeronautical Engineering; M =
Mathematics. Credit hours are given for class hours, laboratory hours, and
preparation hours, listed Separately in that order
