The Linking Segment System, F. J. Corbato; J. McCarthy

In future operation of the Center a situation is con-
templated in which there are a variety of programming languages
in use including SCAT, FORTRAN, LISP and others which may be
developed for various purposes. Programmers may wish to usea
togetherg routines ﬁﬁééi have been written in one or more of these
languages. Routines will be stored on tape or disc files and
should be callable into arbitrary memory locations by loaders and
linkable to new routines through the symbolic names of programs,
data arrays and parameter values. In a time sharing mode of
operation it should be possible to remove from core memory a
routine that has been waiting too long for typewriter input and
bring it back later when it is needed; but possibly to a different
location, since its old place may be taken.

Of the presently available systems)SQUOZE and the FORTRAN
II BSS system come the dosest to meeting the requirements. However,
their deficiencies will not be discussed here.

To improve the above situation a new program form has been
developed that is especially suitable as compiler output. Sub-
programs in this form are called Linking Segment Subprogram (LSS).
The principle innovations of LLS are:

1. Selective retention of symbolic information from
the source subprograﬂbut with the bulk of the text in relocatable

binary.

2. A feature for grouping subprograms into packages
such that the package has the same external simplicity as a
single subprogram. This process can lead to arbitrarily deep
nests of groups.

In particular a LLS program is a relocatable binary program
with three tables,in front of the program, that contain the symbolic
information necessary for linkage, array storage allocation, and
parameter determination at loading time. These tables are called

the USE table, the DEFINITION table, and the ARRAY table.

1. The USE table

 

The USE table contains a list of entries, each of which
consists of a symbolic expression together with a list of the
fields in the program where the value of the expression is to be
Substituted. For example, a matrix inversion program may contain
an entry stating that the value of the symbolic expression A+N*N
is to be inserted in the address fields of locations 97l, 975, and
1024 of the routine relative to its beginning in memory. The
amount of arithmetic allowable in the symbolic expression is subject
to various degrees of ambition, but the address arithmetic of SAP
is adequate for a start with possibly the Boolean arithmetic of
SCAT as an immediate successor. More extreme is a LISP—like recursive
expression.

2. The DEFINITION table

 

The DEFINITION table is a list of pairs. The first entry in
each pair is a symbol and the second entry is a symbolic expression

which defines the value of the symbol. The location of the beginning


-3-
of the routine has the symbolic name "." so that locations within

the program can be defined relative to that point by expressions

like "0+95"

Q. The ARRAY table

 

 

Each entry in the ARRAY table is a pair consisting of the
name of an array used by the program and a symbolic expression
defining the length of the block reserved for the array. The
conventions will be adopted that the symbolic value of the name of
the array will correspond to the location of either the first or
the last-plus—one register in analogy to the BSS and BES pseudo-
operations of SAP.

There are two useful features when combining a group of
subprograms into a Subprogram. The first feature is the convenience
of naming and marking the boundaries of the Subprogram. The
second feature is the ability to alter symbol names to that a
collection of subprograms can compatibly form a single program.

Both of these features are introduced by grouping LLS. Thus an

initial group card of the form

a GRP b,c,... F, u/v, ...y/Z

and
a EGR

as an end group card cause the program enclosed between them to a
group named a. The symbols b, c, ...,f have the same meaning
outside the group as inside it. The symbols u, ...,y are the names

that outside the group correSpond to the symbols v, ...,2 inside the


u

debugged. This version of a loaden which should be completed in
the spring, will operate entirely in core memory.

In addition, a post—editor program is being programmed for
operation on FORTRAN II output. It will editkthe binary output
tape and three BCD output files into LLS form such that:

1. COMMON statements can be set or modified at load time,

and extensive recompilations due to COMMON statement changes

should be unnecessary.

2. With some constraints, dimensions of arrays, in COMMON

can be made symbolic. This feature will be of great benefit

for example, with matrix subprograms.
