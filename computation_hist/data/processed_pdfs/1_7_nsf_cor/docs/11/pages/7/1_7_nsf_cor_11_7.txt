8. Investigation of techniques for intercommunication
between computers, including the possibility of cycles different
in length or kind running simltaneously with frequent comparison,
e.g., several single-accumlator computers with eomn memory,and
the behavior of a computer with mlti 1e accumulators. Some of
these properties can be simulated on a 70‘; by utilization of
additional drums and magnetic core banks.

9. Computer estimation of problem time. In linear problems,
estimations of bounds of certain functionals, and thence conver-
gence criteria for terminating iteration, or switching to a
different iteration.

Facilities:

The MIT Computation Center will have a. Type 70': Electronic
Data Processing Machine with the folloling machine complement:
12 magnetic tape units, 2 magnetic core storage units containing
a total of 8,000 words, 1 magnetic drum unit containing 4,000
words of storage, the usual on-line punched card reader, alpha-
betic printer, and punched card recorder as well as the 3 offoline
magnetic-tape-controlled printer, magnetic-tape-controlled
punch, and punched card-to-magnetic tape converter, respectively.
In addition to the 701! there will be 10 auxiliary punched card
machines including card punches, collators, sorter-s, reproducers,
interpreters, and the Type no; Accounting Machine. The aggregate
macgge rental, in excess of 50,000 per month, will be donated
by .

The Type 70‘} EDPM unit is one of the fastest large-scale
commercial computers available today. Since. the MIT installation
will be but one of many in the field, techniques, programs, and
numerical procedures developed for this machine will be of use
to others having access to 704 equipment.

 

Princi a1 Investi ator to be Professor Philip M. Morse,
Director of the Computation Center. He has been in contact with
computing problems during his career in theoretical physics since
1930, and with the use of computing equipment since the first
Bush differential analyzer was available at MIT in 1936. He got
his Ph.D. in physics at Princeton in 1929 and has been at MIT since
1931, with occasional leaves of absence. His publications include
the books "Quantum Mechanics" (with E. U. Condon') 1930, "Vibration
and Sound" 1936“ "Methods of Operations Research' (with G. E.
Kimball) 1950, Methods of Theoretical Physics" (with Herman
Feshbach) 1953, and "Queuing, Inventory and Phintenance" 1957,
and about a hundred Journal articles, many of which give results
obtained from machine amputation. For further biographic details
see "Who's Who". Only a fraction of his salary will be charged to
the Project.
