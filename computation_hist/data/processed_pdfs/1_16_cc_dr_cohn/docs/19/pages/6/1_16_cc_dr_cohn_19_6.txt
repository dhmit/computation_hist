term as in equation (9) but with error term 0(1).

We might add in conclusion that to a certain extent the behavior
characterizes the theta function. For, if a theta function satisﬁes the
relation f(z) x (z —— p/q)”, for 3 real, as zap/q in a Stolz neighborhood,
then f(z) is of degree 0 and s = ~2m, where m is the order of f(z). This
would follow immediately if We knew that f(z) was of ﬁnite degree, since
then only the degree zero would permit of a behavior which is a power of
(imp/q). To see that f(z) is of ﬁnite degree, note that a wide enough
Stolz neighborhood about [I/q becomes, in the i—plsne, a region wide enough
to inelude the inﬁnite portion of any vertical strip of width 1‘ Thus, how-
“"91' 351’ may approach so, f(z’) is smaller than some power of (2—p/q),
