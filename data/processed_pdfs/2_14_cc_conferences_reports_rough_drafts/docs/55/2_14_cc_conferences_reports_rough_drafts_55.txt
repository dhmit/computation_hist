Dear Sir:

I am writing to you to obtain information that will
help me in my choice of a graduate school.

I am about to begin my senior year at Case Institute
of Technology, where I am majoring in mathematics. My point
average is 2.5 out of 3.0.

In graduate school I hope to do much of my study in
analysis, geometry, and mathematical physics. I am also
interested in research associated with digital computers.

During the last year and a half I have been an under-
graduate assistant at the Case Computing Center. My chief
work for the last few months has been to help write and
debug a Univac I algebralc compiler that is presently
nearing completion.

While in graduate school I would like to continue
work in the field of automatic programming techniques,
perhaps in areas such as machine translation of languages
or proving theorems on a computer. For this reason I
would like to learn more about the work you are doing in
computer applications, both in theory and programming.

Are assistantships associated with computer work available
for first year graduate students? If I chose, could I
possibly earn my Ph.D. by a thesis written about a subject
similar to what I have mentioned above?

I will greatly appreciate any information you send me.

Yours truly,

Cob Opadion
