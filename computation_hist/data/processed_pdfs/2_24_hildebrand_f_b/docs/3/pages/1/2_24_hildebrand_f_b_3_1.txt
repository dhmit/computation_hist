Professor Ffaneis B, Hildebrand
Room 2-169
m. I. T.

Dear Professor Hildebrand:
In connection with our previous discussion
about a course in Numerical Analysis, I wonder if you
ecould meet with the Committee on Machine Methods of
Computation to discuss the matter further. The meet-
ing 1s tentatively set at 2 p.m. Wednesday, April 2,
in my office, unless this is an hour which you cannot
make. | f .

The Committee consisting of Professors Lin,
Reissner, Caldwell, Forrester, Feshback, and myself, 1is
quite interested in planning course programs in this
general field. The course which you indicated you are
willing to give next year will be an important part,
and we should like to hear your general 1deas as to
what you might cover. Perhaps some of the Committee's
comments would be helpful to you.

Please let me know if 2 p.m. on April 2 1s
convenient with you.

Yours,

P. M. Morse
