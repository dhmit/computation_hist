Dear pr. Blackburn:

In order to effect proper operation of the forthcoming
Type 738 Magnetic Core Unit, MIT will have to make a number of
modifications on the underfloor air supply to this machine,
Specifically, the present dust connections on the two 737 units
will have to be removed and a new air supply provided for the 738
unit,

I would very much appreciate receiving a scaled drawing
for the model 738 gnit which would allow me to make the necessary
duct assembly connections to the base of this unit, The drawing I
need is similar to the previuously-developed IBM drawing 680898-20
which was crested for the Type 737 unit when we installed it in
June of 1957. This drawing would assist us in making proper duct
connections to the base of the 738 unit. I realize that the 704
Installation Manual contains drawings of the 738 unit (plan view);
however, on the 737 we could not use the manual drawing since IBM
modified the unit to permit duct connections. I would like a
correct drawing to make certain that the previocusly-installed machine
parts all fit the 738 machine when it arrives.

Sincerely yours,

A F. M. Verzuh
