or at worst a very short delay. Such problems requiring on
the order of 1-2 minutes of computer time suffer from the de-
iay which occurs when they are mixed in and batched with the
longer programs. This situation has led to the acquisition
of many additional small machines whose principal virtue is
their accessability, and whose defects are manifold, includ-
ing a limited computling capacity, much higher cost per compu-
tation, and a very limited repertiore of "higher" programming
languages.,

These machines, however, have a very great appeal to
the average researcher. In part 1t is the same psychological
appeal that a self-service market has over an old fashioned
one-clerk store. In addition, however, a researcher knows
that he can make better use of an instrument if he works and
tries it out at close range so that he can "understand" it.
This attitude has produced sufficient progress in the past as
to be worthy of recognition.

d. Classroom Use as a Teaching Ald

There are many ideas and concepts in sclence and en-
gineering that when applied to anything beyond the most trivial
cases become so cumbersome to demonstrate that it 1s hard for
the student to gain an appreciation, and a "feel"‚Äù for what is
happening. Many problems in field theory, dynamic systems, ma-
trix analysis, etc. share this barrier to an adequate under-
standing. On the other hand, 1t does not help if an instructor
merely presents a solution and says "Here it is."

The student feels uneasy if he cannot see how the
problem was formulated and solved, and gains a qulcker under-
standing 1f he can ask to see the effect of a parameter va-
riation, etc.

Since most problems of thls nature are Increasingly
being solved by computer, there seems every reason to include
