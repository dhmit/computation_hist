and thereby saving 100 microsceconds of machine time."

= The student obtained a keen sense of appreciation of
the ease of setting up a special analog machine, such as REAC, to
solve an ordinary differential equation. He learned the important
distinction between externally-programmed computers, @.g. CPC,
and internally-stored-programmed computers, such as Whirlwind.
Finally, he learned th:.t the outward characteristics of these
calculators could be changed by the operator. Specifically, the
CPC can act as:

1. A 10-diglit FIXED decimal calculaÂ®or,
2. A 12-digit FIXED decimal calculator,
3. An 8-digit FLOATING decimal calculator,
4, A 13-digit FLOATING decimal calculator

by the mere insertion of another set of control boards. Similarly,
the Whirlwind computer may behave as three different types of
computers depending upon the type of conversion programs and service
routines which are employed.

Conclusion .

This paper describes the need for undergraduate tralning
in the  application of computing devices. Some attempt is made to
1llustrate the effect that the advent of generally-available computers
will have on an undergraduate program. The particular method of
subject presentation employed at M.I.T. is deseribed. In addition,
some mention is made of the actual subject material covered, and
the general level of the subject 1s emphasized, Specific mention
is made of the self-service, student use of the four types of
calculators which was made during the term. Finally, the students
were given an indication of the types of problems which can be ef-
fectively handled by computing devices.
