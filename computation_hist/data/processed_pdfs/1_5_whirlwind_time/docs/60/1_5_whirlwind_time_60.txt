Dear 8ir:

I have been suthorized to eredit your account
with 10 hours of machine time on the Whirlwind I computer
for work under problem 343, Weather Prediction.

You might be interested to know that since your
problem began, you have used 587.0 minutes ( as of April 22)
of computer time. If your problem had been charged at the
regular rate of $250/hour, the total amount charged to you
would have been $3,446.03.

If you find that you need more time, it will be
necessary for you to submit a new request.

Sincerely,

F. M, Verzuh
