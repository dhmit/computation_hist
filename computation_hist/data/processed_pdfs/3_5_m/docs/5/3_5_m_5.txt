Dear Mr. McCormack:

Thanks very much for your prompt action in preparing the
invoices for the IBM Corporation under our operating contracts with
the corporation, I would like to ask you to make a slight change in
future invoices; namely, I would like the names and salaries of
individuals deleted from future invoices. This is consistent with our
operating agreement and discussions held with Messrs. Cusick, Blackburn,
Gammon, and Verzuh on October 23, 1957. At that meeting it was agreed
that Dr. Blackburn would be continuously informed of the salarkes and
rates of all participating personnel, However, the invoices as such
would not contain this information. It is furthermore desirable to avoid
a salary breakdown since the last invoice contains the salary of Prof. Morse
and this, of course, is something we need not include on any oi our invoices.

I recommend that we retain the present format; however, merely
refer to salaries as follows: two key punch operators and one machine
operator on Paragraph 17, one key punch and one machine operator on Paragraph
18, and "staff salaries‚Äù on Paragraph 186.

Sincerely yours,

F, HM, Verzuh
