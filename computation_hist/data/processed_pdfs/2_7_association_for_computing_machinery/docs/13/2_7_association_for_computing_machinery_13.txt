Dear Professor Slater:

The IBM Corporation recognizes that your research and educational
program in the Laboratory of Chemical and Solid State Physics is extremely
significant for physics and chemistry. We also realize that your long-range
plans for computing will not satisfy your demands in the immediate months.

Ag an interim and partial solution to your needs during the next
twelve months, 1BM is pleased to offer to you up to two hours per day of
IBM shift time at the M.I.T. Computation Center during the period June 1,
1960 to May 31, 1961. This offer will be contingent upon the availability of
time after the normally scheduled IBM shift runs are completed. The
availability and scheduling of such time can be arranged through my office.
This offer should in no way affect your obtaining computer time in the
normal manner during the M.I.T. shift time.

We make this time available to you as a recognition by IBM of the
importance and significance of your research program and by our desire
to assist you as much as possible with computing time over the next
twelve months. We are delighted that we can make this oifer to you, and
we are looking forward to the results of your expanding research.
