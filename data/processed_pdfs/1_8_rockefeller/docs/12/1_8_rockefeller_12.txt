Dear Dr. Buchanan,

As you suggested in our talk of November 9, I have been ‘keeping
an ear open for examples of the soclal science problems in which our
the potential of such
problems is largely unknown so that most examples must be of past
computer applications. One example though of research activity which
offers the promise of good team-work between a Computation Center
staff member and soclal scientist is the following.

Professors Theodore Baer and Ithiel Pool of the M.I 1.7. Center
for International Studies have approached us on the feasibility of
"Computing Optimal Electoral Redistricting in Massachusetts". Thies ge

‘a problem of immediate interest in the local political situation bu:

is also a type of problem of longerange national significance. Pro-
fessors Baer and Pool have thought ( the problem to the point of
developing various criteria of "goodness" (e.g. closely or evenly
distributed political strength in each electoral district, homogeneity
of socio-economic factors, ete.). In my Judgement, their ideas are
now "ripe" for close liason with a computation specialist so that the
difficult task of quantifying their concepts and solving their problem
can begin. The method of solution will probably be by the techniques
of "linear programming” which are very powerful on optimization prob-
lems of this kind.

I should say that the above problem was essentially brought to us,
a procedure which in general puts the burden of computer knowledge on
the social scientist. It is very likely that there are many problems
of similar interest waiting to be discovered by computation experts
consulting with social scientists. I need say no more since this was
the gist of Professor Morse's proposal.

In addition, I have talked with Professor Orcutt of the Economics
Department at Harvard. Professor Orcutt, who 1s als¢c the Harvard
Representative ,of our Computation Center, wa Vg Ra h to Llurvey

Bee San aes ut in qn (Sgtivities ALS activities divide roughly

into two classes, those involving standard mathematical manipulations
and those which utilize the computer for simulating or behavior studies
of economic systems. A brief list of these activities is:


. =

Professor Leontief (Harvard): inversion of targe matrices touts’ ENE
100 x 100 matrices and larger); input-output analysis, 5

National ‘Bureau of Economic Research: separating seasonal ard trend #
movements from economi¢ data and statistics ‘80 that more “weaning he
ful information is obtained.

University of Michigan: elaborate multiple regression sehaved,

Professor Jay Forrester (M.I.T. School of Industrial Management): Fon TEE
economic models of firm behavior and economic systems.

Cowles Foundation (Yale): interested in using complicated models of
“economic systeus.. Tiuited applications have been made on a wall
computer (IBM 050} bu t the machine speed is inadequate. Their

approach 18 to lh the problem by a large system of
+ Susp ions and then use Hone Carlo” techniques to find the
solutions.

Professor Orcutt (Harvara)l interested wi the simula ation ge economic
systems, not as abstract models, but in such a fashion that
contemporary economic problems can be considered.

The goal of our Center is not to compete as sg dial scientists
with activities such as those listed but rather to! contribute from

the computational expert side towards the inclusion of modern computing 5

machines in social science research.

Professor Orcutt has sald that he will be glad to amplify any of
the above topics which I have attempted to summarize, (any distortions
are mine). Due to the press of time before your December 3 meeting,
his phone numbers are: (office) KIrkland 7-7600, extension 2550; (home)
IVanhoe 4-2896.

If I can be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to
contact me.
