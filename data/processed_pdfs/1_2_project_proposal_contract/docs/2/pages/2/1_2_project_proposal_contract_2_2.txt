The program which ONR might wish to suppoft can be divided
into four sections: | 7

1. Research in methods of numerical analysis and the formu~
lation of scientific problems for machine solution, together with
Support of training of students in these methods,

2« Support of the scientifiz and engineering applications
group previously referred to with Projeet Whiriwind so as to make
the WW computer useful and available for the above research, and
aid to the ressarch being carried on Dy MIT fagulty and students,

3« A partial support of the maintenance of the Wy computer,

4« HResearch on an investigation of digital computing machine

components.,

It 1s understood that details of the Program, which is
neeessarily evolutionary in character, will be worked out from
