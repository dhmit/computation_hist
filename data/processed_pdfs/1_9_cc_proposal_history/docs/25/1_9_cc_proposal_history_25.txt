i At the last mooting of the 704 "steering committee” it was
pe ; decided to extend your leave of absence until July 1. Please
IE ~~ yeturn before that if you possibly can. If your curreat project
“should extend beyond that date, remegotiatinn will certainly
be possible, but currently your leave of absence will expire
on July 1. |

 

 

We certainly need an axport on the 704 y ‘Segluiing right now to
help ug learn the code, but you should certainly try to complete
the Fortran job before returning.

Peg and I would like to extend an unofficial invitation to
come again while skiing is still good,

Hope to hear from you soon.

Good luck,

Dean N. Arden
