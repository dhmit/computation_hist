Introduction

SAP;, the SHARE Asgsembly Program for the IBM 704 is a medium for
writing computer programs which is characterized by a predominantly one-to-one
correspondence between the symbolic imstructions writtem and the wmachine in-
structions produced, The additions to SAP described in this memorandum allow
the programmer to define sequences of symbolic coding which may contain vari-
able parts, and thersafter to incorporate such sequences into his program by
giving only the name of the sequence and the desired form of the variable infor-
mation to be substituted, Sequences of coding which are used asg described
above are called macro instructions, Msny computer programs have repetitive
sequences of codimg, and in such casges the use of macro instructions can reduce
the programming effort, Macro imnstructions also provide a powerful tool for
building new programming systems,

The ability to define and use macro instructions has been a part of
assembly programs for other computers, and has even been added to SAP by iso-
lated 704 installations before now, The present version, however, is extreme-
ly flexible, and in particular is believed to be more powerful than the macro
features now in SCAT (the SHARE Compiler-Assembler-Translator for the IBM 709
and 7080), The power of the macro instructions to be described is due to the
freedom of substitution allowed within macro instructions, to the use of paren-
theses as delimiters rather than as paris of symbols within macro imstructions,
and to an accompanying set of instructions to the assembly program (pseudo-
operations) which allow the assembly of macro instructions with variable length
and conteant,

This memorandum is intended to be tutorial, and after giving a brief

outline of the major additions to SAP proceeds from simple to more complicated

examples of their use, This method of presentation causes essential informa-
tion to bae scattered, ‘ .. %

The pseudo-operations basic to the use of macro instructions are;
HOP, for definition of macres; MAC, for insertion of macros; IRP, for repeti-
tion of a seguence of instructions within macros; IFF, for conditiomal assembly
of instructions within macros; and ETC, for extension of the variable field of
HMOP and MAC cards, Other pscudo-operations to be described allow remote defi-
nition of symbols, and control of the printing of expanded macros,

Baslc Use of HOP and MAC

The operation of MOP permits the programmer to give names to sequencss
of symholic instructions which will occur repeatedly in omne or more programs,
The operation HAC calls for the insertion of such seguences into the cuorrent
program, For example,

HOP ADD3 A B,C
CLA A

ADD B

STO €

END ADD3

is the definition of an open addition subroutine named ADD3, having three
dumny arguments which will vary from use to use, Once the above definition
is given in a SAP program, three-address addition cam be used at will by giving
e macro call such as

MAC ADD3 X Y, 2

which will result in the expanded segment of program,
