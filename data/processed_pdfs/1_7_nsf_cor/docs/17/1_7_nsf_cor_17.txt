SEL so that in the full year of full operation, July 1957 to

1958, we can operate at the rate of $35,000 a year, as
estimated in last year's forecas¢. Estimated details of budget

photographic "linotype" equipment called Photon. Many programs
of importance in physics and engineering have been, or are being
translated from Whirlwind language to 7O4 language, such as the
work of the Solid State Theory Group under Prof. J. C. Slater
and the large-shower calculations of Prof. Bruno Rossi. The
meteorology group under Prof. Charney, recently moved here from
Princeton where their work was initiated by Von Neumann, is
planning to use a substantial amount of machine time, and will
| require the advice and help of our staff to program their various
calculations. We will be assisting the Harvard Observatory staff
in calculating satellite orbits in preparation for, and during,
the IGY sétellite "shoots". Dr. S. Ulam of Los Alamos, who has
been a Visiting Fellow to the Center this year, has been assisting
us develop "Monte Carlo" techniques. Prof. John MeCarthy of the
Dartmouth Mathematics Department (one of the New England colleges
participating in our program) will be here next year and will be
interested in developing machine logic and in further investiga-
tions of the behavior of "automata" by means of simulation pro-
grams. The staff of the MIT library 1s interested in exploring
the possibilities of storing and recovering information by
machine methods and a project in the MIT Language Department on
machine translation, supported the Rockefeller Fo,
expects to use our equipment to I thelr ideas. Other
gEapS: at the 23 participating colleges, are planning further = .
work.

Title of Pro

   

posed Research:
Research on Digital Computer Operation and Utilization

Investigation into the patterss of operation of electronic
digital computers and the methods whereby they can be used in
mathematical and experimental research; including studies of
numerical analysis and machine programming methods, investigation
of the possibilities of the complete mechanization of the sequence
of recording, processing, analysis and presentation of experi-
mental data and the working out of such specific applications of
machine techniques to problems in science, englneering, and
administration as will clarify the basic stsmatrulr and suggest new
points of view.

Desired Starting Date: September 1, 1956.

Time Period: Three years, with a reassessment during the fall of

1959 to determine whether further support is advisable.

Proposed Research - Background Information:

We are organizing what should be one of the most fruitful
centers for research related to the use of electronic computers.
in this country. IBM is contributing one of its 704 machines,
maintained and equipped with appropriate auxiliary equipment.
IBM and MIT are providing the building, part of the new Compton
Laboratory, and MIT is contributing some of the staff from its
departments of mathematics, electrical engineering, physics, and
industrial management. The machine will be available, 35 or more
hours a week, free of machine time charge, to MIT staff and
students for non-classified and non-routine research. MIT
research in the Center will be coordinated by the Institute
Machine Computation Committee.

In addition, the Center will be available, up to 35 hours
a week, on the same basis, to other colleges in New England.
Already 23 institutions have indicated their interest in parti-
cipating and have appointed faculty members to be their Insti-
tutional Representative. These representatives will coordinate
the research done on the machine by students and staff of their
institution. IBM is providing some funds for stipends for
graduate students who wish to learn machine use by helping with
some of this research.

In this atmosphere and wlth these facilities, there is an
unparalleled opportunity to do important and basic research in
all phases of the use of digital computers in science, engineering,
and business. A central research group, supervised by faculty
embers and staffed by workers picked from the graduate students
of MIT and other colleges, working closely with persons from the
other colleges, will help coordinate the work of the Center and
will carry on research of their own in machine logic, in tech-
niques of machine computation, and in specificfapplications of

 

   

 

‘machine operation to experimental and theoretical problems, thus
appreciably broadening the range of applicability of computers
"in the physical and social sciences and in engineering.

It 1s appropriate for government agencies to help support
the research of this central research group. The group's work
will, in part, provide an expanding basis of knowledge of numbri-
cal analysis and programming techniques, which can be used by the
other participants at the Center and will, in part, break ground
in new fields of mathematical logic and methods of data processing
Which will be needed in the application of digital computers to
new tasks.

Most of the senior staff for such a research group is
already assembled at the Institute. Part of it is the group which
developed Whirlwind I programming; others are in various depart-
ments of the Institute. From time to time, some of the staff of
the participating colleges will join it for a semester or a year,
on leave from their institution, to work full time at the Center.

IBM -and the Institute will contribute about a half million
dollars a year to provide the equipment, building, maintenance and
operating staff of the Center. We believe that a contribution of
about $120,000 a year will support the activities of the central
research group, which will energize and take the lead in the
research carried on at the Computation Center by students and
staff of MIT and the particppating colleges. We list later in
this proposal some of the specific research projects we are pre-
pared to start on. Other projects will develop naturally from
these and from the problems encountered by the other workers at
the Computation Center.

Part of these additional funds can be obtained from some
of the research projects which will use the facilities of the
Center. Although the use of the machine itself will not be
chargeable, most users will need advice from the Center staff as
to preparing thelr programs, will need help in detailed coding
and will prefer to have our staff carry out many of the actual
runs on the computer. This will add to the duties of the staff,
and part of the additional cost will be charged to those projects
which can afford thls extra service. Those students and faculty
members who cannot afford to pay for this help will be able to

‘use the machine, but will be expecté@&d to do their own coding,

The Rockefeller Foundation has granted the Computation

ut $100,000 for three years, Beginning July 1, 1957,

support of a staff to investigate applications of

igital computers in the social sciences. Thus only about

35,000 a year is needed to complete the support of the Center

staff, enough to support that part of the staff concentrating on

the physical science aspects of the activity. In order to get

our plans well under way, this grant should be continued for

about three years (as with the Rockefeller grant), after which
rogram should be re-evaluated to determine needs beyond

 

  

 

   

 

1. Investigation of Structure and Syntax of input languages;
the possibilities of coding directly in mathematical, logical or
business language. f

2. Development of routines capable of translating from
algebraic notation to computer code and vice versa, including
possibly automatic selection of numerical techniques and auto-
matic error analysis.

5. Development of numerical analytic techniques particu-
larly suitable for use by digital computers; such as more
general expansions, truncated Chebyshev polynomial sums for
simulating standard functions by a common block of instructions
but small sep2rate blocks of coefficients and cycle counters and
methods of automatic determination of best grid spacing, by trial
plus Richardson extrapolation or other means.

4. Investigation of Monte Carlo techniques for large
problems. |

5. Extension and/or imppovement of present techniques for
communication between machine and operator and for the more
flexible control of machine operation, including possible
improvements in input-output equipment.

6. Experimental analysis and control using data trans-
mitted directly between computer and experiment.

7. Investigation of microgrogramming and other methods for
increasing the flexibility of computer design. The posbibility
of inclusion of a very flexible control unit in a large-scale
computer which would permit ready alteration of an order code.

Facilities:

  
  
 
 
  
  

The MIT Computation Center will have a Type 704 Electronic
Data Processing Machine with the following machine complement:
12 magnetic tape units, 2 magnetic core storage units cont
a total of 8,000 words, 1 magnetic drum unit containing
words of storage, the usual on-line punched card reader, alpt
betic printer, and punched card recorder as well as the 3
magnetic-tape-controlled printer, magnetic-tape-controlled card
punch, and punched card-to-magnetic tape converter, respectively.
In addition to the TO4 there will be 10 auxiliary punched card
machines including card punches, collators, sorters, reproducers
interpreters, and the Type 407 Accounting Machine. The aggregat
machine rental, in excess of $50,000 per month, will be donated
by IBM.

The Type TO4 EDPM unit is one of the fastest large-scala
commercial computers available today. Sincé& the MIT installation
will be but one of many in the field, techniques, programs, and
numerical procedures developed for this machine will be of use
to others having access to 704 equipment.
