Perhaps the above deduction ig overly pessimistie. However ,

 

the proposed location in Building 20 will possibly encourage decentraliza-

tion of the punched-card facilities. Soon each Administrative Office may

request individual machines for their own offices and a general 12-unit

decentralized--type of operation may result, such as at Harvard. Clearly,

this resultant type of operation would be direct contradiction to the

centralized-type of service which has been the basis of Statistieal
Bervices.

Certainly, the real disadvantages, limitations, etec. must be
considered as well as the advantages before a definite deciision con-
cerning space reallocation is made.

In closing, I again wish to emphasize that I personally am not
acting as an "obstructionalist‚Äù in this proposed space change. I merely
wish to record some of the possible difficulties which will arise in
the execution of administrative services. In any case, irrespective of
the outcome of the deeision on space, I want 1t understood thst I shall
make every effort to make the Statistical Services succeed.
