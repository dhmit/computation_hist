side join continuously. On the expansion side 14‘ is double valued in the yz-plane. This
difficulty can be avoided by modifying the upper side of the boundary as follows.
First, examine the hodograph of the swept Prandtl-Meyer ﬂow. In Fig. 2 let 0N*

be the undisturbed velocity in the yz—plane, and let I\' be the projection of N" onto the
plane II that passes through the origin and is normal to the leading edge. During the
expansion, the component of velocity normal to II remains equal to NA” While the
component parallel to H traces an arc \E of a Prandtl—Meycr epicycloid, shrunk by a
factor (I ~ NN"2)W, Fig 1 shows that the x-axis is under the plane boundary, so the
angle AOE is acute. Hence the cpicycloidal are A E cannot have another intersection
with the line NS, parallel to 04. Now construct the hodograph by subjecting every
point of NE to the displacement NNf“ Clearly, during the expansion from ON* to OE“
the angle between the velocity vector OLV’K and the yrplane (H) steadily increases
(decreases).

Now let A be the intersection of :c = O and the plane Mach surfaces that pass through
the leading edges and are based on the undisturbed velocity. Let P be any point on A.
From the nature of the hodugraph it is clear that the streamline through P for the simple
wave in :5 Z 0 turns immediately into .c > O and stays there. Hence an entire conical
stream sheet through A bends into a: > 0. Thus it is possible to separate the two regions
of swept Prandtl-Meyer flow by means of a symmetrical cortical tin, the thickness of
which increases with increasing sweep. Note that at the junctions of thc ﬁn and the
original boundary u, is parallel to x, . According , near the corresponding points X“
