When heat flows out perpendicularly through a
spheroidal isotherm, the amount flowing through any
slice made perpendicular to the axis of symmetry is
directly proportional to the width of the slice, inde-
pendent of the position of the slice with respect to the
spheroid.

G. RESISTANCE HEATING OF THE CORE

The theorem stated above shows that, in order to
keep the core heated uniformly, the amount of heat sup-
plied must be the same for any unit length of the core.
Since the amount of heat generated in the wire wrapped
around the core is proportional to the length of wire,
we must distribute the winding density suitably. As-
suming that each turn of winding is a circle, the length
of wire used per unit axial length is given by :

dL/dz=2mrn(z),

where 7(z)=the number of windings per unit axial
length.

If dL/dz is to be constant, n(z) = 1/r. It is impractical
to use such a variable distribution; instead, the core is
subdivided lengthwise into an odd number of equally
wide sections, each section being wound uniformly by
the same length of wire. The number of windings of the
1th section is then given by:

n,-/,/:fdz= l/A c1y

where A.; is the area of the lengthwise cross section of
the 4th slice.

Hence, the amount of windings for each section is
given by

H. INDUCTANCE HEATING OF THE CORE
This will be discussed in a subsequent paper.

I. TIME TO SETTLE TO EQUILIBRIUM

The core is heated fairly rapidly, and consequently
thermal equilibrium is disturbed. The time that elapses
between disturbance and re-establishment of thermal
equilibrium is made up of two terms: the time needed to
heat up the core and the time needed in addition until
thermal equilibrium exists again in the walls. Since
infinitely slow heating does not disturb equilibrium,
while instantaneous heating produces the worst dis-
turbance, we can get a fair estimate of the settling time
by assuming instantaneous heating, thus somewhat
underestimating the time lag for heating the core, but
overestimating the time needed for thermal equilibrium
to re-establish itself.

The temperature obeys the following time-dependent
equation:
Vi0=(1/h*)060/dt, where h?

THEORY OF ENVELOPE TYPE THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY TESTS

subject to the boundary conditions:
t=0: 0(u,0)=s(u) foru>u,,
where s(u)=steady-state temp. before heating.
t=0: 6(uy,t)=8,,
where 6. is the final temperature of the core.
0(us3, t)=s(us).

The solution is given by:
6(u, 1) =s(u)+[(As—A)/(As— A1) 10— 82)+ T (x, 8), (7)

where T'(u, t) satisfies Eq. (6), and vanishes at /—s o
(T represents transients), while

T(u,0)=—(As—A)(8.—61)/(As—A,).

It is difficult to solve Eq. 6 for spheroidal coordinates,
since in the nonsteady state there are no spheroidal
isotherms in the walls. However, the settling time may
be approximated by finding it for a spherical wall and
for a plane slab. These two results agree so well that the
same answer may be assumed for the spheroid. For the

The settling time is usually defined as the time neces-
sary for the transient to reach 1 percent of its initial
value, and is seen to be proportional to the square of the
thickness, and inversely proportional to the thermal
diffusivity. For a double wall, we consider the two
layers as being heated in series; the diffusivity being
much greater for the inner layer and its thickness less,
we regard only the settling time for the insulating outer
layer as finite. The series for 7'(, ) converges so rapidly
when the exponential term becomes of the order of
1 percent, that we drop all but the first term. The coeffi-
cient of the exponential term varies with the shape of
the vessel, but this does not influence the settling time.
It is seen that the spheroidal wall would settle to equi-
librium most rapidly at the thinnest section, which
causes heat to flow laterally until equilibrium is estab-
lished throughout. The settling time is thus approxi-
mated by :

ls=(2 In10)d?/=%h2,

where d=greatest thickness of wall layer with lowest
diffusivity, 4*=lowest diffusivity.
