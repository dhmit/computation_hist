Electronic Computers in Social Science

The Facility and its Potentlalities

The high-speed computing facllity, to be installed by
IBM at the new Computation Center at MIT willl be the largest and
most flexible facility in this country to be devoted exclusively
to unclassified research and education. IBM will contribute more
than a fifthantza million a year in its support for maintenance
and operation. What is needed, in addition, to make thia an
outstanding center for the investigation of digital computer
potentialities in all branches of scientific research, is about
g100,000 a year for the support of a research staff, which can
work with scientists in various fields to develop new and more
effective techniques of machine utilization.

Arrangements have been made for all the colleges 1n
New England to participate in the use of the machines, and IBM has
set up funds for Assistantships to enable graduate students, at *
MIT and at the participating colleges to spend time at the Center,
learning to use the equipment. (The installation is expected to be
completed by February 1957. Details 8f the installation and of

arrangements with the participating colleges are 31ven in Enclosures

B and C to this proposal. This Center and these arrangements X
represent potentialities for new developments in soclal and physical
science of great and unexplored importance.

There will be no charge, for machine time, made to students

or faculty of the participating institutions. Maintenance and the
