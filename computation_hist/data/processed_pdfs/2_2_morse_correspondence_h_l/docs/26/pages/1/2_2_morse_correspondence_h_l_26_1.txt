Dear Mr. Stevens:

Thank you very much for your kind invitation
to attend your dedication of the Arthur D. Little Computing
Center on Monday, June 18. Because of my participation in
the Acoustical Congress, I personally will not be able to
attend. However, I would appreciate 1t if the following
individuals could attend:

Mr. Dean Arden, Digital Computer Laboratory
Miss Eleanor Donovan, Statistlcal Services

These two people are concerned with the opera-
tion of the Whirlwind and the 650 calculators at M.I.T.
I feel that they would benefit by attending your
dedication.

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse, Director
M.I.T, Computation Center
