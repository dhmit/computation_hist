1, The MIT Automatic Operator Program

The MIT Automatic Operator Program provides the 704 user with
a flexible scheme for tape-to-tape computer operation involving a minimum
of intervention by the human operator, Two immediate advantages which
result are greater efficiency and accuracy in computer operation, A third,
and perhaps less obvious advantage is that runs of greater complexity may
be safely scheduled by the user, This need not necessarily imply a great
saving of actual computer time, but it may enable the user to obtain re-
sults in a single run which normally might require several runs spread
over several calendar days,

An attempt has been made to minimize the number of restrictions
which the system places on the user, Thus the user proceeds much as he
normally would: using SAP and FORTRAN 1 for assemblies, reading in and
operating binary decks, and using MIPMR1 and NYDS1 for dumps, To use the
system he need only sacrifice the first eight registers of core memory and
six magnetic tape units, This latter restriction may, of course, be fatal
in many problems,

The logical tape units used by the system are the following:

Unit Function
1 SYSTEM TAPE
2 PRINTER OUTPUT TAPE
3 PUNCH OUTPUT TAPE
4 RUN INPUT TAPE
5 BINARY OUTPUT TAPE

6 .. BINARY INPUT TAPE
The operator Program, other utility programs, and subroutine libraries
are permanently recorded on the SYSTEM TAPE. The PRINTER OUTPUT TAPE and
the PUNCH OUTPUT TAPE are used to hold information which the operator pro-
gram records for off-line printing and punching, The user is required to
use -these for the same purpose, The programs and operating instructions
for a run (or for several runs) are recorded on the RUN INPUT TAPE, The
BINARY OUTPUT TAPE and the BINARY INPUT TAPE are used by the operator pro-
gram for temporary storage during the execution of a run,

Runs are recorded in sequence on the RUN INPUT TAPE using the

The execution of a particular run may be conveniently broken up

into the following three phases
Phase 1: The Translation Phase

Phase 2; The Operation Phase
Phase 3: The Processing Phase
which always occur in order,

The translation phase assembles the decks which form the run and
records them, in absolute binary form, on the BINARY INPUT TAPE, Each deck
must be preceded by a direction card whose operation field defines the
kind of deck which follows, We have

SAP: SHARE Symbolic Deck

BIN: Column Binary Deck

PMD: MIPMR1 Post-Mortem Request Deck

FTN:  FORTRAN1 Symbolic Deck
It is possible for a run to consist entirely of translation time but normal-
ly the run proceeds to operation time after all the decks involved have been
assembled,

During the operation time the various decks which have been as~

sembled
and recorded on the BINARY INPUT TAPE may be brought to memory and

executed in
any sequence, Post-mortems may also be executed and results

are record
orded in binary form on the BINARY OUTPUT TAPE, If an error Stop

occurs during a user's
program, the computer operator may, by a simple

process, con
’ tinue automatic operation, The user then has the option of

continuing his run
re or of terminating it and executing a special list of
mortems called error post-mortems

CC-75-1 Sa

Processing time begins after operation time has been terminated,
The processing phase translates the binary post-mortem results recorded
on the BINARY OUTPUT TAPE to symbolic BCD form and records them on the
proper output unit (on-line printer, on-line punch, PRINTER OUTPUT TAPE
or PUNCH OUTPUT TAPE), At the end of processing time the operator pro-
gram proceeds to the translation phase for the next run,

In the following chapters we describe each of the three phases
in detail, An attempt has been made to completely describe the operator
program in as few words as possible, A more leisurely development of the
system can be found in the "User's Introductory Manual to the MIT Auto-

matic Operator Program’,

The title which the user assigns to a deck during translation
time can be used on suitable direction cards during the remainder of the

run to refer to the deck.

REM REMARKS

The function of the translation phase is to read program decks

in sequence from the RUN INPUT TAPE, to assemble them, and to record them

in binary form on the BINARY INPUT TAPE, The direction cards, SAP, FTN,

BIN, and PMD, serve as title cards for the decks and identify the kind of

deck that follows,

The variable field of a title card must contain a title which

the user
assigns to the deck. This title must have one of the following
orms :

Every run must terminate with a TER direction card
TER M100-5-1NOVS58

whose variable field contains the run title. If a TER card occurs during
translation time it will terminate the run and initiate translation time
for the next run,

The EOT card is recorded at the end of the RUN INPUT TAPE by
the computer operator and does not concern the user,

It is possible for a run to consist entirely of translation
time (e.,g., a user wishes only to assemble a SAP deck) but in general
runs proceed from translation time to operation time, The transition

occurs whenever the translation phase encounters one of the following

direction cards on the RUN INPUT TAPE,

The operation phase begins by interpreting the direction card which caugeq

tion time they a

The Direction Cards
These direction cards are used to convey special instructions

to the operator and may occur either during translation time or operation

time,
The SIR card is logged on the on-line printer and stops the

computer, After the operator has carried out the displayed instructions

he will press the start button to continue the run,
For example

SIR PLACE REEL 156 ON LOGICAL 9

tN
Ww
1

will cause the operator to place a specific reel of tape on logical tape 9,

The DPR (dear printer) card is logged on the PRINTER OUTPUT TAPE

followed by an end-of-file gap, When the tape is printed the end-of-file

gap will stop the off-line printer with the DPR card displayed, After the

operator has carried out the displayed instructions he will press the start
button to continue printing,
For example

DPR SWITCH TO SINGLE SPACE

will cau
se the operator to set the carriage control switch on the printer
to single space,

The car

when a ta

For example
SWD 1,3,5
delays the run until switches 1, 3, and 5 are down and switches 2, 4, and
6 are up,
The direction card
RDY TEST FOR TAPES READY
requests the operator to rewind and put in ready status those logical tape
units mentioned in its variable field, The run will continue automatically
as soon as the operator has set up the requested tape units,
For example
RDY 7,8,9,10
will delay the run until tapes 7, 8, 9, and 10 are rewound and ready.
The user may not request the operator to rewind any tapes used
by the operator program (i.,e,, he may list only units 7, 8, 9, and 10).
SHARE Symbolic Decks
A modified version of SAP 3-7 has been included in the transla-
tion phase, In the following sections we describe the changes and addi-
tions that have been made to the assembly program,
A symbolic deck must be preceded by a SAP title card, for example
SAP M100-5-1
and terminated by an END card,
END 100
The translation phase will assemble the SAP deck and record the resulting
binary program on the BINARY INPUT TAPE with an associated symbol table,
Both the program and the associated symbol table are given the same title
(namely the one appearing on the SAP title card), This title can hence-
forth be used on appropriate direction cards during translation and opera-
tion time to refer to the binary deck and the symbol table,
The associated symbol table will always include those symbols
assigned during the first pass of the assembly but may (as we shall see)
include other symbols,

Control of Listings, Binary Decks, and Symbol Tables

Three pseudo-operations have been added to SAP 3-7 which give

the user control over listings, binary decks, and symbol tables,

LST is a program segment variable, 1.e.;

legal LST appears in a program, then the entire program is listed on the
PRINTER OUTPUT TAPE,

The SAP pseudo-operations, SKP, SPC, and PLR, also affect the

listing. Any combination of these with LST is permitted,

(2) The pseudo-operation
PRG
controls the punching of binary decks by the assembly program and must
have one of the following words in its variable field,
ON Produce a binary deck in row binary form on
the on-line punch.
OFF Produce a binary deck in column binary form
on the PUNCH OUTPUT TAPE
NONE Do not produce a binary deck,

If none of these words appears, then the PRG pseudo-operation is ignored.

PRG is a program segment variable, If no legal PRG pseudo-operation occurs

in a program, then a binary deck is not punched,

The kind of binary cards produced is determined by the occurrence

are program segment variables,

eck, then the.

’ he .program words in their domain are not recorded on the BINARY

section 2,3,4 and chapter 3

(3) The Pseudo-operation
SMT

controls the punchi
ng of the first Pass symbol table by the assembly prea

gram and must have o
Ne of the following words in its variable field:

cC-75-1 ou

ON Produce a binary symbol table in row binary

form on the on-line punch

OFF Produce a binary symbol table in column binary

form on the PUNCH OUTPUT TAPE

NONE Do not produce a symbol table

If none of these words appears, then the SMT pseudo-operation will be
ignored,

SMT is not a program segment variable, All but the last legal

SMT card read during an assembly will be ignored, If no legal SMT card
occurs in a program, then a symbol table is not punched.

The three pseudo-operations are independent of one another and
can occur in any sequence, The following statements describe the order
in which the binary cards are punched,

(1) A title card of the form

BIN M100-5-1
will always precede any off-line output produced by PRG or SMT cards,
The user's title (assigned in the variable field of the SAP title card)

will appear in its variable field, BIN title cards are never punched on-

line,

(2) The symbol table (if selected by SMT) is punched next on
the selected punch,

(3) The program (if selected by PRG) is punched last on the

selected punches,

A List of Changes to SAP

(12) Any legally defined direction card (except REM) will

terminate a SAP assembly and will be interpreted as a direction card by

the operator program,

Error Detection in SAP

The assembly program always records a binary version of the

symbolic program on the BINARY INPUT TAPE. It will, however, detect

certain questionable cases and tag the resulting binary programs as

bad, This tagging is of significance during the operation phase,

(1) Any assembly which causes the letters, U, M, P, or R,
to print on the left of the listing is tagged as bad,

(2) Any assembly not terminated by an END card is tagged as
bad,

(3) Any assembly involving the pseudo-operations, FUL or REL,
is tagged as bad,

(4) If an assembly contains TCD cards and if any of the sub-

decks which result are bad, then all of the subdecks which result are
tagged as bad,

The user should note that the appearance in a listing of the
letters, A, T, D, or Q is not sufficient to tag the program as bad,

Column Binary Decks

A modified version of the FORTRAN1 relocatable loader has been
included in the translation phase so that binary decks in column binary
form may be read from the RUN INPUT TAPE during translation time. This

program can load the following kinds of cards.

(1) Absolute symbol table cards

(2) Absolute and relocatable information cards
(3) Absolute and relocatable transfer cards
(4) FORTRAN relocatable origin cards

(5) Octal correction cards

A column binary deck must be preceded by a BIN title card,

for example '
BIN M100-5-1

and terminated by a transfer card. The translation phase records the

The CST card is most concisely described by defining a MEMORY
SYMBOL TABLE for translation time which 1s formed according to the
following rules:

(1) The MEMORY SYMBOL TABLE is cleared at the beginning of
translation time,

(2) A CST card with a blank variable field does nothing to
the MEMORY SYMBOL TABLE,

(3) A CST card with a non-blank variable field causes the
following steps to occur;

(a) The MEMORY SYMBOL TABLE is cleared unless a CST
card intervenes between the CST card just read and the last SAP, BIN, FTN,
or PMD card read,

(b) The MEMORY SYMBOL TABLE (which may have been
cleared in step a) and the symbol table mentioned in the variable field
of the CST card are combined to form a new MEMORY SYMBOL TABLE, The
title mentioned on the CST card must have been previously encountered
and a symbol table having the title must actually appear on the BINARY

INPUT TAPE,
(4) The direction cards, SAP and BIN, cause the following

steps to occur:
(a) The MEMORY SYMBOL TABLE is cleared unless a

CST card intervenes between the SAP or BIN card just read and the last
SAP, BIN, FTN, or PMD card read.
(b) The MEMORY SYMBOL TABLE (which may be cleared in

step a) and the symbols assigned within the SAP or BIN deck are combined

to form a new MEMORY SYMBOL TABLE,

(5) The direction card, FTN,
d intervenes between the FTN card just read and the

clears the MEMORY SYMBOL TABLE

unless a CST car
last SAP, BIN, FTN, or PMD card read,

(6) No other direction card (e.g., PMD) affects the MEMORY

SYMBOL TABLE,

The MEMORY SYMBOL TABLE is recorded on the BINARY INPUT TAPE

whenever a SAP or BIN deck 18 assembled during translation time and is

associated with the deck.

marks car

(1) Every post-mortem request deck must be preceded by a PMD

title card, for example
PMD M100-5-1
(2) Post-mortem request decks are not required to have termi-

nation cards (one merely stops writing PMR requests) although a card

having one of the SAP instructions, HTR, TRA, or TTR, in its operation

field will terminate the deck as before, The variable field of this card

is, however, ignored,

(3) The MIPMRlL format for punching binary cards (BIN) has been
eliminated,

The translation phase will assemble the PMD deck and record it
on the BINARY INPUT TAPE, The title in the variable field of the PMD
card may be used during operation time to refer to the request deck,

If symbols are used to specify memory ranges in PMR requests,
then these symbols must be assigned in the MEMORY SYMBOL TABLE when the
PMD deck is assembled, Unlike SAP and BIN decks, no symbol table is
associated with a PMD deck on the BINARY INPUT TAPE,

If the title on the SAP title card is
A*j
where i denotes an integer,

then the title associated with the kth sub-
deck is

A*(i+k-1)
The first example was for the case where the title did not end in the
characters, *i,

The translation Phase records each sub-deck on the BINARY INPUT
TAPE and assigns to them in turn the Systematically modified titles de-
scribed above, These titles can henceforth be used to refer to the sub-
decks, Only one symbol table, however, is recorded on the BINARY INPUT
TAPE (namely the MEMORY SYMBOL TABLE resulting from the assembly) but
this is automatically associated with all of the sub-decks and can be
referred to by writing any of their titles,

If the symbolic deck contains PRG or SMT pseudo-operations
which require that binary cards be produced, then BIN title cards con-
taining the systematically modified titles described above will be pro-
duced for each sub-deck requiring punch-out; moreover, if the title on
the BIN card does not end with the characters, *00, then it will be pre-
ceded by a CST card with a blank variable field, Thus replacing a sym-

bolic deck by a binary deck obtained from a SAP assembly will not, in

general, affect a run Only one punched symbol table per assembly is

(2) Record the FORTRANl storage map on the PRINTER OUTPUT TAPE,

(3) Translate the FORTRAN1 relocatable binary deck to an abso-
lute binary deck and record it on the BINARY INPUT TAPE, This translation

 

is identical to that which would be given by the standard FORTRAN1l reloca-
table loader,
The title contained on the FTN card may be used on appropriate |
direction cards during operation time to refer to the binary deck on the
BINARY INPUT TAPE, However, no symbol table is associated with this deck,
The user chooses the various options available in FORTRAN1 by
placing suitable control cards immediately after the FTN title card and
before any source program cards, Under normal conditions (i.,e., no control

cards) the compiler does the following:

(1) Punches on-line the resulting FORTRAN1 relocatable deck in
row binary form,

(2)

(3) Performs a relatively fast compilation without index regis-
ter optimization,

Records the SAP listing on the PRINTER OUTPUT TAPE ,

Association of Post-Mortem Request Decks with Pro

grams

: Normally it is illegal for two decks assembled by the transla-

tion phase to have the same title; however, the fact that a PMD deck and

a program (SAP, BIN, or FTN) deck have the same title is of importance

during the operation phase, When this occurs the two decks are associated

so that when one refers to the title during operation time, one refers to

both the program and the post-mortem, The exact meaning of the associa-

tion will be described in Chapter 3, At this point, however, we shall
give the formal rules for association since it occurs at the end of trans-

lation time,

1) . If a program deck and a post-mortem deck have exactly the
same title, then the post-mortem deck is associated with the program deck,
| The term, title, as used in this section refers to the trans-
formed title described in section 2.1. Thus the post-mortem deck
PMD M100-5-1%*01
would be associated with the SAP deck
SAP M100-5-1%1
(2) If a program deck, or a set of consecutive program decks
having the same title except possibly for the last three characters (*d d,)
-mortem deck having a blank title, then

is immediately followed by a post

the post-mortem deck is associated with all of the progr

three sub-decks and we write the sequence

PMD
PMD M100-5-1%01

This would cause the untitled post-mortem deck to be associated with the

decks, SAP M100-5-1%00 and SAP M100-5-1%02, and PMD MI100-5-1*01 to be

associated with SAP M100-5-1%01

Logging During Translation Time

The translation phase will record all direction cards which it
encounters on the following devices:
(1) The on-line printer - this gives the computer operator
a step-by-step record of the run in real time,
(2) The PRINTER OUTPUT TAPE - this allows the user to infer
the sequence of BCD output obtained during translation time,
The user may suppress the logging of a particular direction
card on the PRINTER OUTPUT TAPE by punching any non-blank Hollerith charac-

ter somewhere in its location field,

3. The Operation Phase

General Description
aummA—————————————————————

e
Operation time is initiated whenever the translation phase read
one of the following direction cards from the RUN s

INPUT TAPE:
CLR CLEAR CORE MEMORY
RIP - READ IN PROGRAM
RIU READ IN PROGRAM, UNCONDITIONALLY

The direction card which initiates the operation phase is also the first
direction card interpreted during operation time
A complete list of direction cards which may legally occur

during operation time follows:

direction cards encountered by this phase are logged, The rules are the
following:

(1) If the first range request processed by the processing phase
selects a printer for output (FPR or NPR), then all direction cards pre-
ceding this range request are logged on the same printer, Otherwise they
are not logged,

(2) If the last range request which was processed selected a
printer for output, then a direction card encountered by the processing

phase is recorded on the same printer, Otherwise it is ignored,
