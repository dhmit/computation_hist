b. Binary Information. READ TAPE and WRITE TAPE state-
ments must address tapes outside those used by the
Monitor system. However, when the programmer knows
the complete disposition of the various tapes used
during Monitor operation, those tapes not being used
may also be addressed. For example, if a binary tape
is wanted for intermediate storage during execution
of the program, a Monitor tape may be available for

that particular object program run.
pifferences Concerning End of Program.

End of Execution. The statements that stop the machine
(STOP and PAUSE) should not be used. Instead, the last
executable source program statement must be one of the

following:

a. CALL EXIT. This statement causes immediate
termination of the job. The Monitor is restored
to core memory and control goes on to process the
next job.

b. CALL DUMP (Al, By R et G Fn)

1 1 n n
where A and B are variable data names indicating

limits of core storage to be dumped. Either A

or Bi may represent upper or lower limits. F,i
is a fixed point number indicating the format
desired, as
E=i1 10 dump in octal
=/ dump in floating point
= a interpret decrement as decimal
integer
= '3 octal with mnemonics

The core dump is effected as specified, the Monitor

is restored to core memory, and control is transferred
