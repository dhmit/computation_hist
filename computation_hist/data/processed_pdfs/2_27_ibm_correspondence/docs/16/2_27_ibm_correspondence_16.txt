Dear Profes sor Morse:

During the past few months I have received a number of requests
for information regarding the offerings of universities in operations
research and data processing. Therefore, I would greatly appre—
ciate the following information:

1) Do you offer courses in operations research? If you
do, whom are they open to, and when are they offered?

2) Is it possible to obtain an advanced degree (Masters,
Doctorate) in the field of Electronic Data Processing
or in some field where Electronic Data Processing can
be a major part of the research project or dissertation?

Sincerely yours,

//
