Gentlemen:

The Institute of Mathematical Statistics has established a subcommittee
to determine the availability of free machine time in order to carry out
computations of mathematical tables. A function of this subcommittee is
to determine where this time is available, how much time is available,
and under what conditions this is so. As this information is obtained,
the fact that time is available will be made known to members of the
Institute of Mathematical Statistics and possibly other mathematical
societies. Any request for time will be evaluated by the proper commit-
tee on mathematical tables and a procedure will be set up to activate
each individual project.

We are calling upon you to help us on two matterss
l. We would like to know what free machine time you do have available.

2. We wish to know of other institutions or corporations who might be
in a position to give us free machine time,

Will you please fill out the enclosed questionnaire and return it to me
at your earliest convenience. Rest assured that this is not a commit-
ment on your part. Any request for free machine time will be handled on
its own individual merits. Any final decision to make this time avail-
able will; of course, be that of your institution or corporation.

Let me take this opportunity to thank you for whatever assistance you
may give us in this matter.

Sincerely yours,

Fred C. Leone, Chairman
Subcommittee, Computing Facilities
and Cost Free Machine Time

Committee on Mathematical Tables
