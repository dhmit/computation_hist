BE: ” Sudusbrial | Liaison Conference on Machine Methods of Computation -

Proposed Title: The Role of Anslog Computers in Industry.

A discussion of the basic principles of analog computers will be
given with particular emphasis on the various types of differential
analyzers. In addition, various types of special-purpose analog computers
such as the simultaneous equation machines, correlators, ete. will be men-
tioned. Pertinent physical characteristics and limitetions, e.g. speed of
operation, probable agecuracy, ete. will be covered. 4 disocuszion will be
given of some of the types of problems whlch heve been solved on the
Differential Anelyzer -~ - particularly those frequently encountered in
industry. Finally, mention will be made of snalog-digital machines and
some of their applicstions.

Detailed discussion of the actual computer components snd the method
of setting problems upon the Analyzer will be reserved for the lnspection
trip to the Analyzer.
