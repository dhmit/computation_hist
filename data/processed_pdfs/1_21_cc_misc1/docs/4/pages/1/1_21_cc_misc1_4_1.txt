Dear Sir:

As initiators of a project for the preparation by computer of a
Concordance to the Works of John Calvin, we are writing you both
t o acquaint you with the project and to appeal for help.

It is our understanding that certain computer facilities at M. I. T.
are open to approved projects initiated by educational institutions in
the New England area. The Hartford Seminary Foundation, a long-
established interdenominational post-graduate theological school,
through its Board of Trustees has approved the Concordance pro-
posal and has advanced a small sum to initiate the work. The de-
tails of the proposal are covered in the enclosed paper.

We should lvery much appreciate your studying this paper; if
then you will advise us of the steps to take in requesting help from
your facility, we shall be indeed grateful.

S g / W.(
Sincerely yours, 2
