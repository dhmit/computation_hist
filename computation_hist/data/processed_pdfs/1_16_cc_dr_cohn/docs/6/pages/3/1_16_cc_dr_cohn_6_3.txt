the Riemann function is a function of four variables, 130;, y; :c’, 2/), deﬁned by
the system
(a) 673/01 6;; = —I{(1; + y)R

(2) (b) It = 1 when r =, a" 01- y = yr.
We shall assume for convenience that H(r)_ is regular and real for 7. real, and
that ac and y are real in all cases under eonsrderation.

To prove the existence of R by iteration, we rewrite the System (2) as the
single equation

(3) R(:c,y;:r’,]/) = 1 — H Ito, ,y. ;r’,y')z{<.r. +y,) (11-, d1,

This series is seen to be convergent and to represent a solution to (3). Equation
(3), or system (2), also has a unique solution, or otherwise expressed, any solution
to the homogeneous form of (3), with the term I deleted, would vanish identi-
Cally.

These statements are made because the iteration process will motivate the
rest of the paper.

3. More general illustration of a Riemann function. We saw that the
iterated series (4) for R begins with the terms 1 7 [V + where
U = J‘J‘aomlﬂl‘. + y.) div, dyx . Now U obviously equals zero when a: = I'
01‘ y = y'. Thus since It is also a constant for these values of :L' or y, we might
try to see if the Riemann function has the form R((‘; r’, y’). Substituting this
new value of R into equation (25,) we ﬁnd that the Riemann function actually
can be written in this form if and only if (alﬂar) (al' 61/)H" is expressible as
full; .1". 1/). Then (2) becomes
