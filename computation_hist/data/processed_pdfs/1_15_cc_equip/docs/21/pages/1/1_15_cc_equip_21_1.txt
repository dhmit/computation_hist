Dear Prof. Verzuh:

Mr. Carlson. from your office, called me today to:ask about
the modifications of the two key punches you received this past week so
that they will be compatible with the FOR TRAN Operation. I told him that
I had already discussed this completely with you at our staff meeting last
Tuesday, that the parts for modifying the key punches had been ordered
and would he installed very shortly. We were not able to get this done at
the factory because when I expedited the auxiliary machines to be delivered
in October, these first two machines were delivered before the paper work
had been processed.

I trust this completes the story on these two key punches.
I have checked the specifications on the remaining punches and they will
all be delivered with the FORTRAN key print.

Yours very truly,

G. Truman Hunter
