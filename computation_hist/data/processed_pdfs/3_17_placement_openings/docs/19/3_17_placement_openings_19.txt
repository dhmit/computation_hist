Dear Dr. Horn:

1 am pleased to enclose a check for $1, 250. 00 for the second
semester portion of the University of Rhode Island appointments to the
M.I.T. Computation Center as described on the attached sheet. The
IBM Corporation is very grateful for the work of the Research Associates
and Assistants in the program for they have contributed a great deal to its
success.

There are now thirty-four colleges and universities in New
England participating with M.I.T. in the Computation Center. The new
IBM 709 has been in operation for four months, and already seventeen of
the colleges have made use of it. For your information, I am enclosing
a table of usage for the months September - December, 1960.

I am delighted that the University of Rhode Island continues to
be such a steady user of the Center at M.I. T., and I know that you are
all looking forward to the very imminent installation of your own IBM 1620.

Sincerely yours,

M. Loren Bullock
University Representative
