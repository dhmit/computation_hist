Dear Professor Morse:

I am writing to enclose a program for the June 22 University Computing
Center Directors Seminar. I wish to again express my pleasure that
you are going to participate in this program.

I would appreciate your sending me a biographical sketch for purposes
of introduction prior to the meeting date. As mentioned earlier, it is
desirable to have a writeup of your talk for purposes of reproduction
and inclusion in a binder to be distributed at the meeting. I would
appreciate receiving this as soon as possible. In the event that you
are unable to find time to write a complete paper, please send an
abstract of your talk.

I look forward to seeing you in Poughkeepsie.

Sincerely yours,

  
 

F. Blackburn
