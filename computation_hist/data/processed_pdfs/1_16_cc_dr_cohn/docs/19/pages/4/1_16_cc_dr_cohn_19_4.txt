ALMOST»ALGEBRAIC NUMBERS 1045

I946)

By our condition on the order of magnitude of eh“, it follows from
(6) and (7) that for some h, |E(¢(0))] g [E(4r;.(9))| — IRAQ)! >0; and
«7(9) can not satisfy the algebraic equation E(cr) =0. Q.E.D.

A simple method of satisfying the conditions on <7(x) is to take
:r,(x)=l+x“+x"+ - - - +x"’+ - - , , Ix. <1. Then n(x) and x are
not both algebraic unless x=0, and indeed, the values of x (730) for
which a,(x) is algebraic are some instances of the type of transcem
dentals under discussion. '
