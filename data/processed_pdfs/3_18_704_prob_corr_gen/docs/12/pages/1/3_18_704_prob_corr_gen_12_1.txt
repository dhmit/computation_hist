How can something as complex as a company’s
personality be evaluated scientifically?

A company image study necessarily deals on a
very high level of abstraction. For this reason a
company’s personality image has always been
difficult to assess—so much so that until very
recently it was considered impossible to evaluate
the image of a company in anything approach-
ing a precise and systematic manner.

People responsible for a company’s reputation
have always realized that the personality of a
company, like the personality of a human being,
is made up of many different dimensions, or
“traits”. The problem has always been to find
out what these personality traits are, and then
isolate them so that they can be studied one by
one.

How The Bolger Company isolates and defines
the personality traits of a company

The solution to this problem is based upon recog-
nition of the fact that any personality trait of
importance to a company would certainly be cap-
able of expression by one or more words in the
English language. A comprehensive anal
therefore made of eve
anguage (the 60,000 5 V

= Y COSLC 4
ate Dictionary and the 52,000 words in Roget’s
Intemanonii %'ﬁes\aurus ). Every word which could
reasonably be used to descn% a company was

studied. The words were then divided into dis-
tinct synonym groups (using Webster’s Book of
Synonyms).
