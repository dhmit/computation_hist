Dear Dr. Todd:
Subjeet: File No. 1.1

Professor Morse has shown me your letter of
July 16 in which you inquire about matrix inversion techniques.
Tnasmuch as our 7O4 began operation in June, we are just
getting settled down.

In particular I am completing a real, symmetrie,
matrix diagonalization subroutine using Jacobit's method:
(which we llke very much because of 1its trouble-free nature)
this subroutine can, of course, be used to invert any real,
non-singular matrix and I intend to prepare this form of the
program too. (Ultimately these programs when fully checked
will be submitted to SHARE for distribution.) I will be glad
to send you some Of the results from the matrices you suggest
whenever I get them. It would be appreclated if you could
send any reprints of the results which you presented at the
recent Wayne University Conference.

Sincerely,

A corbaté
