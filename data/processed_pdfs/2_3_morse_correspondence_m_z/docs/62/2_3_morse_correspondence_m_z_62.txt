Dear Professor Morses

TI am one of the authors of the Pitman publication, "Faster Than
Thought", which you may have read. Pitmans have asked me to revise
the chapter in that book "Digital Computers Applied to Games", and I
intend to include some discussion of work along these lines in this
country.

Dr. Bauer has suggested that you could give me some information

on this subject, or possibly refer me to someone else who could help
mee

T would be grateful for an early reply, since I have to complete
this revision by September 1, 1956.

Yours truly, :

dy dal
