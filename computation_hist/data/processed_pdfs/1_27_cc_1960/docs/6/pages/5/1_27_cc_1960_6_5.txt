the experiment or the scientist can go on to the next step and
request the n xt computation in turn. 0n the 704 this would,
require the exclusive use of the machine, though only a fraction
of the 704 speed would be used; obviously again, time-sharing
techniques are needed.

These, and many other programs now in progress, such as
the character—recognition studies -. i _ “. , the research
on economic forecasting and on operational behavior using large-
scale simulation techniques, should be of particular interest to
IBM, for they have direct bearing on the proD mress of computer
design and utilization. They represent the sort of cooperative
re search beLHeen experts in different fields which does so
effectively, and they involve the combination of research and
edu.oation for which EJIT is pre

 

neat. This work deserves

support by IBM, in addition to the educational activities which
are already being supported by the present contribution of the 704.
They can most effective] lyx%§ﬁthe installation of a 7090, replaci_v
the 704, in toe near future; MIT will then be able to provide

the SEEEEHIIE ancillary equipment to push ahead with dispatch.
Because of the "iiiter-oonnectedness" of much of this research,

it can best be carried out (perhaps it can only be carried out)
in the atmosyher e of mutual coo pe ration sad. exchange of infor«
mation provided by the Computation Ceter.4i?
