Mr, Lynwood S, Bryant
Room 14-N229
Dear Mr, Bryant:
Here is the partial inventory of our 1957 IBM 704 Course Notes
which we discussed on the telephone, It would appear that we can transfer

over to you 450 copies with only a minimum of reproduction necessary,

When these are exhausted, of course, the whole set will probably
have to be reproduced,

I am also enclosing a supplement to the original errata sheet
which you have,

Sincerely yours,

FF. J. Corbato
