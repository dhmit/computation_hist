Dear Professor Morse: (e Ut

The Science Background Symposium for New England Newspapermen that
I spoke to you about on the phone will open at M.I.T, on the morning of
March 6. The group will meet in the Given Room, in the Penthouse of
Building 35, at 9:30 a.m. to hear Professors Franklin and Hildebrand of
the Department of Mathematics.

We should like to invade the Computation Center in the Compton Building
about 11 a.m., and have you explain the operation of the computer and answer
questions about it. If you wish'to have an associate participate, as you suggested,
will you let me have his name, please, so that he will be listed on the program?

We are scheduled to have lunch at the M.I.T. Faculty Club after the
computer demonstration, and hope that you will be able to accompany us to
lunch. We should also like to invite any of your associates who appear on
the program to attend the luncheon. The luncheon speaker will be Mr. Alton
Blakeslee, science editor of The Associated Press in New York.

 

After lunch, the group will hear talks on physics, The next day the
group will be at Harvard, to hear about biology and medicine.

We expect between 24 and 30 newspaper reporters and editors from the
leading New England papers.

With best wishes,
As ever,
S
