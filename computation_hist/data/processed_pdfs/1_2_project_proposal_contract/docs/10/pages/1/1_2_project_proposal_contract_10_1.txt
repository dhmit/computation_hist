Reference: Contract N50r1~06001
Dear 8ir:

The Massachusetts Instltute of Technology submlts
herewith a revised proposal for extenslon of the reference contract
to June 30, 1957 at an sdditional estimated cost of $20,960,00,

Wwe understand that thie proposal has been the subject of dlsous-
sions between Professor F. M. Morse of MIT and Mr, A, J. Wise

of ONR=MIT, Dr., Carl F. Mukenhaupt of ONR-Boston, and Dr. F, Jo
Weyl of ONR=Washington.

There follows & gummary of expenditures and funds
remaining on the two projects, whirlwind Operation and Machine
Metheds of Computation, which are currently active under the
reference conbract:

Projeot #6345 (Whirlwind Operation) hag an unexpended
palance of $97,000 as of November 30, 1955, The ourrent axpend~-
ftures are approximately $10,000 per month, The aversge "income®
received for Whirlwind usage 18 approximately $3,000 per month ==
a net expenditure of $7,000° per month. 7f it is assumed that the
present level of income (§3,000 pexr nonth) is maintelhed during
the ninetsen-month period Decembsr 1, 1955 to June 30, 1957, a
minimum emount, assuming some tapering off, of $119,000 will Dbe
required durlng this period,

However, for the purpose of establishin%'an estimate of
unexpended funds on thls project as of Juns 30, 1956, 1t 1ls esti-
mated thet a higher level of incone will exist during the remaining
geven months. Thls may average something sbove &)4,000 a moenth, On
this baslie we estimate that $57,000 of the $97,000 mentioned above
w111 remain unexpended as of June 30, 1956, An additional factor
affecting the budget shown on page 4 Ls the egtimated Computer

Income for the one=year period ending June 20, 1957. For this period
only $18,000 in Computer Incoms hes been estimeted, This ie 1n-
£luenced by two factors: one being an expected tapering-off of the
use of the Whirlwind machine by other projects, and secondly the
expected beginning of operations under the TEM Type 704 machine,

Pro ject #6%%% (Machine Methods of Gomputation) has an
unexpended balance of $%71,000 as of November 30, 1655, The current
expenditurss are approximately $7,000 per month, If it is assumed
that the present expéndltures remain conatant, there will be a balance
of approximately $22,000 on June 30, 1956, In accordance with our
present’ plans’ for terminating the ONR suppor’ of this project on

Junhe 30, 1956, there will be certain addltional costs extimated at
87,000 assoclated with the closing out of this project including guch
