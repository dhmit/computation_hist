Dear Professor Morse:

I should like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation
to you and the staff of the MIT Computation Center for the splendid co-
operation which we have received from you over the past year. I think
that everyone in the Computation Center is to be congratulated for play-
ing a vital part in the initial year of operation of this facility.

Speaking both for myself and the other IBM personnel involved
we feel that the first year here has been highly successful in every
sense of the word. We believe that the intended mission of the Computation
Center here as a major center for education'and research has been
started in an excellent manner and I am sure that as the operation continues
over the next few years it will become more and more successful and
more and more useful to the New England college community.

Inasmuch as I am leaving MIT at this time, I should like to
take the opportunity to thank you personally for the excellent co-opera-
tion that I have received during my stay here on the campus. I wish
you continued success in this important work.

Yours very truly,
