AB the work on our TOh expands, we find 1t necessary to
+ help set up programs for a fair number of new and interesting

   

~~ problems. This means that we are having to expand the programming .. =
staff of the Computation Center here, and it oceurs to me that =
‘you may know of some younger person who would be interested in ~~
Buch a position. We are not looking for someone who necessarily
has had a large experience in programming but are looking for ~~
~~... someone who has had a good background in mathematics (a bachelor's
or master's degree) and who is interested in computing machine
~ applications. The person who comes would have a chance to take
... @ course or so and could go to various seminars around the place.
* he could work at the Center for a year or so and then take a
part-time job while working for his degree. = Bb S58

 

We have a wide range of problems from those of language
translation to those of calculations of nuclear characteristics.
~~ We do not code the usual problem which comes to us, so these
persons would be engaged mainly in the special and interesting
problems and in writing out programs rather than detailed coding,
Taithoush there may be exceptions). 0 any | z :

| I would appreciate it if you could let me know of any

person who might be interested in taking such 2 position either
this spring or next summer, or in suggesting that such pepple
should write me directly. The salary we would offer would be
normal to universities, not as high as industrial positions, but
the man would have the opportunity of further class work and would
have contact with a wider variety of problems than in industry.

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse
