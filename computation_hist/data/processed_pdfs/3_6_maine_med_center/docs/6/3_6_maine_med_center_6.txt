studies, as long as the conductors represent
equipOlElliial lines or areas of the original field.
The, ﬁeld in the region inside the metal con»
diictors in ﬁgure 4 would be different from that
ofa similar region in figure 3, as in the former
case the equipotentials tend to be tangent to
the conductors. The zero line is similar in the
two cases, however. The bending of the external
zero line in figure 4 is due to the slight asym-
metry of the two groups of conductors. The fact
that the field at points aw; ' troni the hall'-
shells is very similar to the field produced by a
point source and sink is in keeping with the
demonstration7 that any distribution of sources
and sinks has a statistieal average, which is
equivalent to a single source and sink. (This is
not meant to imply that the potential disli'ie
biitioii near the heart is necessarily equivalent
to that produced by a single dipole.)
