‘Dear Professor Wiener:

We would be very glad to have Professor
here, and would give him a chance to work
he computing machines at the Center. But
we do not have an extra job for him there. Our
finances are tight just now and we have to use what
money we have to hire regular staff.

If he can find some other way of financing
his trip and stay here, we will be glad to be of
help to him during his stay. | |
