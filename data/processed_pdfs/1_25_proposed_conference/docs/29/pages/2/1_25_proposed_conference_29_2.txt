Each of these subgroups would elect two representatives to
present the concludions of the day's deliberations to the full
meeting of the conference next day. On that day these conclusions
would be further discussed and if necessary modified for final
recommendations. Also a group would be elected to plan on the
following day a publication emboding the results of the conference.

It is suggested that the committee planning the conference
consist of Professor Philip M. Morse, M.I.T., Chairman; Professor
Walter Freiberger, Brown University; Professor Alex Orden, University
of Chicago; Professor J.W.T. Youngs, University of Indiana, and any
further members, as may be desirable.
