This is just to let you know that the organising
comulttee has not been lax in thinking about and actually
to some extent plan ing the praposad meeting of computing
i Center Directors. The situation now looks as follows
and we should be most grateful for your comments,

i
AT a

The American Mathematical Society, through its
5 Executive Directory Dr, Gordon Walker, has kindly offered
5 to sponsor the meeting, to be held afier one of their
% regular meetings. They would make the physical arranges
e mentsy see to the preparation of the report, and generally
put their organisational facilities at our disposal, The

i meeting would be billed as one of their Institutes, such
iY as the one on number theory last summer or the one on
i finite groups next year, and would be open, as these were,
2 only io invited people, in this case the computation center
= directors or representatives, The official anplication
3 for .5,Fs support would come from the A.M.S8. and Phil Horse,
i as the Chairman of the organising committee, would prepare
A the statement of aims, etCey to accompany the application.

| We sre planning, if at ell possible, that the meeting be
: held after the American Mathematical Society meeting at
oe the University of Chicago on April 22=23y 19603 that is,
= we would meet April 24-26 at 2 place in or near Chicago
2 yet to be determined,

Would you let me know whether the above plans sound
sensibie to you and whether we may go shead with preliminary
lanning? We would hope to have the application in vour
nands early in December, after approval by the American
Hathematieal Society Trustees, which we confidently expect
t0 be Torthcoming.

With best regards,
Sincerely yours,
Walter Fe. Freiberger |
Associate Professor of Applied Mathematics
