. Is there research in the computer area itself? If so, is it in circuits,

Logic design, programming, numerical analysis, information retrieval,
or in mechanisms and systems? Or is it in tangent areas like linguistics,
psychology, human engineering, systems engineering, or business admini-

stration?

. Is there both research in the area and service to others? If so, is the service

open or closed-shop ?

Is automatic coding available ?

Do the customers need analogue to digital conversion ?

Is the education on computer use restricted to specially designated courses
or do many courses scattered around the university include computer usage?
Is the computer education for undergraduates as well as graduates?

Is a special curriculum with special degrees evolving? Are they already in

It is most likely that we will agree only if each recommendation has explicitly

With these variables in mind, then, the following problems can be discussed:

L What conditions may the supporting agency impose, explicitly or implicitly,

on priority and charge policy ?

Should the support be

a. part of general university overhead?

b. Block support for computing
bl: education, including curriculum development, texts, etc.

b3: programming service?
b4: machine time?
b5: facility administration ?

c. individual support in a project
cl: programming personnel on the project ?
c2: programming service from the facility ?
c3: machine time:

c4: general computer overhead?
