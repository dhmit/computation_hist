output (see page 9 ) is inserted. Where Ii=2,
FORTRAN is instructed to interrogate the actual
sense switch setting. Physical sense switch
settings, however, are not available under
Monitor control. The setting of 2, therefore,
will instruct the Monitor to make its setting
represent that given on the control card or

by the standard setting, as above.

(2) A Monitor control card for the indicator pre-
cedes the program. In this case, the setting

prescribed by this card is inserted.
Dumping During Execution.

The following statement may be used anywhere in the source

program. CALL PDUMP A, B , F ..., A, B, F ) where the
1 1 1 n n n

maximum n is 20. The argument format for A, B, and F are

the same as those given for the CALL DUMP statement.

The difference between PDUMP and DUMP is that, after PDUMP
is executed, the machine is restored to its condition upon
entry, and control is returned to the next executable
statement. The core dumps appear with any other output

from the job on Tape A3.

PDUMP is a primary name appearing on the program card of

the library subprogram, DUMP.

Restriction on use of PDUMP. Do not use the CALL PDUMP

statement when there is a chain link on tape B2 to be
executed subsequently. Tape B2 is used by the PDUMP
program for intermediate storage of the contents of core

storage where PDUMP is loaded.
