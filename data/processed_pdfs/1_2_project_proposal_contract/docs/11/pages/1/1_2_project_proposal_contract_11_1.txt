Dear Sir:

Office of Naval Research #6915

The Massachugetts Institute of Technology submits
herewith a reviged proposal for extenslon of the reference contract
to June 30, 1957 at en additional estimated cost of $20,960,.00,

We understand thst this proposal has been the subjeet of dlscus-
sions between Professor P, M. Morse of MIT and Mr, A, J. Wise

of ONR=-MIT, Dr, Carl F, Mukenhaupt of ONR-Begton, and Dr. F. J.
Weyl of ONR-Waghington.

There follows a summary of expenditures and funds
remaining on the two projects, Whirlwind Operatlon and Machine
Metheods of Computation, which are currently actlive under the
reference contract:

Prbject #6345 (Whirlwind Operation) has an unexpended
balance of $97,000 as of November 30, 1955, The ourrent expend-
itures are spproximetely $10,000 per month., The aversge "income"
received for Whirlwind usage is approximately $3,000 per month =-
a net expenditure of $7,000 per month, If it is assumed that the
present level of income ($3,000 per month) 1s maintained during
the nineteen-month perlod December 1, 1955 to June 30, 1957, a
minimum amount, assuming some tapering off, of $119,000 will be
required during this period,

However, for the purpose of establishing an estimate of
unexpended funds on this project as of June 3C, 1956, it is esti-
mated that a higher level of income will exist during the remaining
seven months., This may average something abové $4,000 a month, On
this basies we estimate that $57,000 of thae 97,000 mentioned above
willl remain unexpended as of June 30, 1956, An additional factor
affecting the budget shown on page 4 is the estimated Computer
Income for the one-=year period ending June 30, 1957. For this period
only $18,000 in Computer Income has been egtimated, This is in-
fluenced by two factors: one being an expected tapering-off of the
uge of the Whirlwind machine by other projects, and secondly the
expected beginning of operations under the IEM Type 704 machine,

Pro ject #6915 (Machine Methods of Computation) has an
unexpended belance of ,000 asg of November 30, 1955, The current
expenditures are approximately $7,000 per month, If it is assumed
that the present expénditures remain oconstant%, there will be a balance
of approximately $22,000 on June 30, 1956, In accordance with our
present plans’ for terminating the ONR support of this project on
June 30, 1956, there will be certain additional ocosts extimated at
$7,000 asgociated with the oclosing ovt of this project including suech
