Insert: â€œOur experience with the 704 used so far by more
than 800 programmers has led us to want to
experiment with a new way of using a computer
to serve a large number of people. In this
system, any typewriter console can at any time
request service from the computer. The computer
will execute small requests without delay and
schedule larger ones. Thus the user requests
and is provided with computatipn rather than the
full services of the computer for a small period.

We believe that such a system will enable a
computer to serve a large number of users more
efficiently and more promptly than present

systems, that such a system will eventually be

used in all computation centers, and that the
pioneering work that MIT intends to carry out will
benefit IBM and the computation industry generally."

Insert: "Potentially, the use of computers may solve the
problem of giving individualized high quality
training in the sciences to students at all levels
without an excessive cost in the time of able
people. A calculation shows that an IBM 7090 with
disc files could handle 3000 students simultaneously
at a cost less than that of teaching them in groups
of 30.
