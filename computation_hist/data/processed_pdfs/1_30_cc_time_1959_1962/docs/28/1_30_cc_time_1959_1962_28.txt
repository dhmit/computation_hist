Subject: Summary of 709 Computer Usage During the
15-Week Period, September 15 through
December 31, 1960 :

In this last operating period, the 709 computer at the Computation Center
was used by persons from 15 of MIT's 20 departments and three of the interdepart-
mental laboratories not counting itself. The only school not represented among
its users was the School of Architecture and Planning. In all, 190 different
problems originating at MIT used 435 hours of computer time. In addition, 81
problems from other New England Universities used 141 hours.

The number of MIT courses which now make use of the 709 in at least part
of their lab work has increased te 14 and this usage represents 17% of the
available computer time. Table III of this report and its accompanying charts
shows that theses are also an important source of work and, in particular, theses
on the doctoral level alone amount to 20% of the computer usage.

DESCRIPTION OF TABLES

The following tables classify and summarize the computer usage during the

period September 15 through December 31, 1960. The specific breakdown is as
follows,

Table I, Usage by academic status of applicant (problem originator)
Table II, Usage by source of support
Table III, Usage by primary purpose

In addition, Table IV breaks down the use of the 709 by IBM on its shift.

(These four tables present a revision of the classification used in reporting
704 computer usage. The principal difference is the division of the previously
reported Table II which classified by applicant and area of activity into tables
reporting academic status of applicant - Table I - and primary purpose - Table IX.)

Reporting is of monthly totals and, as usual, MIT and the cooperating
New England Universities are presented separately.

The figures on pages 7 and 8 are a graphical representation of the information
reported in Tables I, II and III on MIT's total use for the 15 week period. An
additional breakdown by number of problems is represented in these charts.

INSTALIATION OF THE 709

The installation of the 709 was begun July 5th and the computer was made
available, on 28 part-time schedule, on September 6th. The first four or five
weeks of this installation period were spent in renovating the computer room
itself. The air-conditioning duct work layout needed extensive modification, new
electrical service was installed and the steel plates which make up the false floor
had to be removed, reworked and replaced. Finally, after installation of the new
computer, the air-fiow im the room had to be re-balanced. The difficulties, expense
and delay occasioned by these modifications point out the advantages of recent
innovations in the design of computer installations; it is intended to use some of
these new techniques in the 7020 installation in January, 1962.

SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS

The first week the computer was available, it was used for testing of the
programming systems that would be used and the laboratory sessions of the
Computation Center's September Programming Course. For convenience, the period
September 15 through December 31, 1960 was taken as a single operating quarter.
During this time, 271 problems used 576 hours of computer time. Another 98
problems which had been authorized to use the computer made no use of it. The
use of 709 time was very light during the early weeks of this period primarily
because of the need to convert existing 704 programs to the 709. In the later
part of the period, the demand had increased so that serious thought was being
given to a six-day operating week.
