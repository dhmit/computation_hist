PROPOSAL POR EXTENSION OF NSF GRANT No. NSFG2940
to June 30, 1958

Proposal

Although our IBM 704 is now delivered and is in storage at
MIT, delay in completion of the building to house it has delayed
commencenent of the project financed by NSF grant NSF G2940. As
a result, 1t is estimated that only about $8,000 will have been
spent by June 30, 1957. Staff members, which were to have been
transferred to this project, have been continued on the Whirlwind
project until the change-cover, and most of them will not be trans-
ferred until summer. 1t 1s therefore proposed that the project be
continued until June 30, 1958, with an additional grant of only
$13,000, so that in the full year of full operation, July 1957 to
June 1938, we can operate at the rate of $35,000 a year, as
estimated in last year's forecast. Estimated deteolls of budget
are appended, together with excerpts from the eriginal propesal.

Progress to Dafte

Although the NSF funds have not been used to any extent, work
on the first aspects of the proposed research has gone forward
as rapidly as is pessible without the 704 being in running condi-
tion. A complete utility and a post-mortem program have been
developed, and tested out on borrowed 704 time, & much more
flexible assembly program than at present avallable has been
begun, ready for active cocding when cur 704 is in operation.
Discussions have been begun with a view to investigating the
_ incorporatien of a flexible cutput eguipment utilizing the
o ot ‘0 ) ' TN o A Ve ee s
. photographic "linotype" eqguipment called Photon. Hany programs
of importance in physics and enginecring have been, or are being
translated from Whirlwind language to 704 language, such as the
‘work of the Solid State Theory Group under Prof. J. C. Slater
and the large-shower calculations of Prof. Bruno Rossi. The
meteorology group under Prof. Charney, recently moved here from
Princeton where their werk was initisted by Von Neumann, is -
planning to use a substantial amount of machine time, and will
require the advice and help of our to program thelr various
calculations. We will be assisting arvard Observatory staffl
in-calculating csatellite orbits i gn for, and during,
the ICY satellite "shoots". Dr. Los Alamos, who has
been a Visiting Fellow to - year, has been asslsting
us develop "Monte Carle” technliquas. ¥
