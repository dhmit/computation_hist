Dear Phil:

T have tried unsuccessfully to telephone you
for the last couple of days, and have now taken to the
mail as faster,

T have just learned of the dates of your
Conference for Directors of University Computing Facilities.
I doubt that there is any possibility of changing to more
favorable dates, but I thought that I would bring to your
attention our plans for a short course in Controlling and
Exploiting Giant Computers to be held May 23-June ho sk
enclose an announcement of this courses

Tt seems to me that some directors of computer
centers might want to attend the course; however, until we
have enough paying customers to offer free scholarships
this number may not be very great. If you believe there
will be sufficient interference, you might want to try to
change the date of your meetinge I fear that it is impossible
for us to change our dates because of heavy commitments with
regard to the course.

Best regardse

Sincerely,

-
