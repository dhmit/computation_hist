Memorandum to

From P.E.Horse, Director U. I. T. Computation Center.

Subject; Replacement of 704 by a 7090.

Back’round - In June, 1957, somewhat less than three years
ago, a$§O4 was installed at the Computation Center by IBM, under
a special agreement whereby IBM maintains the equipment, contri-
butes toward amortizing the additions to the Compton Laboratory
which house the Center and supports a number of research asso-
ciates who assist users 01 the machine, and EIT staffs and oper-
ates the Center for the use of El? and other cooperating New
England colleges and universities. The primary purpose of the
arrangement is to enable students and faculty of these instit—
utions to learn how to use high-speed computing machines, so that
the next generation of scientists, engineers and industrial exec-
utives will be familiar with machine capabilities -— in other
words the primary purpose is to demonstrate that such machines
are as important a part of the educational equipment of a modern
college as are chemistry laboratories, for example. A secondary
purpose is to foster research in the use of computing machines,
particularly in those fields of application which have not yet
been explored or exploited fully.

To this end, priority on 704 time has been accorded to
regular class use by courses in machine programming and appliceu
tions, to studc
