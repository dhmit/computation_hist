Dear Phil:

I have discussed the case of Professor Lukaszewicz with Robert
Fano and looked back into our history of Polish visitors, and we
would be happy to have Professor Lukaszewicz as a Visiting Scholar
or Professor. However, the primary purpose of his visit would be
self-education. I feel it would not be appropriate to charge his
full salary to academic funds to cover his visit. The return to
our students from such an investment would be small.

We have had dealings with Mr. Richard B. Myer, Director of the
Department for East-West Exchanges of the Institute of International
Education, 800 Second Avenue at 42nd Street, New York 17, New York,
and with Mr. Hjalmar E. Nielsen, Program Assistant, Special Projects
and Arts Department also of the Institute of International Education.
The I.E.E.E. was, at that time, adminstering funds made available by
the Ford Foundation for an east-west exchange program. It seems to
me that this program might be a logical basis for support for Profes-
sor Lukaszewicz's travel and living expenses while at M.I.T. or the
University of Pennsylvania.

If he were to come here, as I have said, we would be delighted
to get him an academic appointment and even augment his stipend with
a small fee for lecturing if the terms of his support permit us to
do so.

Sincerely yours,

felt ls

Peter Elias, Head
Department of Electrical Engineering
