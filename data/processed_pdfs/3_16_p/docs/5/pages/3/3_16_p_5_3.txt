General Editers: Professor Nicholas Metropolis - Chicago

assisted by an international Honorary Zditorial Advisory Board.

The need for speedy publication in this rapidly developing field
has long been apparent, and this new international Series is
established as a medium for the rapid publication of reperts,
review articles, monographs, books of reference and proceedings

of important sonferences, dealing with matters of interest to
workers in the area of computer design, component development,
computer use, and related fields. Much of the important literature
in fields related to computers is in the form of governmental and
industrial laboratory reports with too restricted a distribution;
in the interest of quickly making available knowledge concerning
outstanding developments in these fields, the Editors will commission
contributions to the Series from all countries in the world,
including the U.S.S.R.

It 1s realized that many workers in this fast moving field cannot
devete the necessary time to producing a finished monograph.
Because of their concern for speedy publication, the Editors will
not expect the contributions to be fully polished writings if the
originality of the ideas they contain warrant immediate and wide
dissemination.
