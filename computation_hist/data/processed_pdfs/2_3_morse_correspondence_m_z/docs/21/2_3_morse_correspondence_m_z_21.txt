Dear Professor Morse,

On behalf of the group that came TO the seminar on Electronic
Calculation from the Naval War College on Tuesday, 13 Novem-
ber, I would 1ike to thank you and all of your assistants for
giving us such a thorough and informative survey of the field.
I feel that all of us are better prepared now to think about
applying computers in the places they can be useful to the
Navy. This is the objective we had in mind.

A11l of the group particularly appreciated Dean Bitter's kind-
ness in inviting us to lunch; which we thoroughly enjoyed.

Altogether it was a very interesting and profitable day.

Very truly yours,

Robert P. Beebe
