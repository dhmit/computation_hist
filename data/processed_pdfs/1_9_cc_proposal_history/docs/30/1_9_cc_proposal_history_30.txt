REQUIREMENTS FOR ELECTRONIC COMPUTING EQUIPMENT FOR
TRAINING AND POR EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH AT THE INSTITUTE

A Report to the Administration, from the Institute
Committee on Numerical Analysis and Machine Computai;ion

The Problem - It is becoming apparent that high-speed slec-

fronic computers "are here to stay”. Industpial concerns are

now planning thelr use to mechanize data gathering and re-
cording and for automatic control of many processes. In
some technical fields the use of such machiries has becone a
commonplace part of engineering calculations. Seientifis
research in some fields, hitherto avoided because of their
complexity, is now being prosecuted, using machines for
theoretical calculation and for data processing. By the
end of another decade a general understanding of computer
operation and use will be & necessary part of The knowledge
of engineers and research scientists. Already the aircreft
manufacturers are requiring that the engineers they hire have
such knowledge. :

In view of this rapld development it 18 important,
if the Institute is to keep in the forefront of technica.
education, that students be given the opportunity to lean
the characteristics of the various types: of computing machines
they are likely €o use and to learn how they can be used by
actually using a few. At the undergraduate level this may
not require the addition of a special course. The Aeronanti-
cal Engineering Department, for example, believes i% can work
in the necessary training and use as a part of one or mMOrd
of their regular courses, though special elective courses
should be available for those students wishing to get more
than the minimm treining. At the graduate level several
courses should be avallable, ranging from training iu the
mathematics of mumerical analysis to courses in the detalls
of machine design. Basic to all of this training, however,
is the requirement that the students have access ©0 setually
operating machines. Details of operation, which would take
hours of discussion in a classroom, are quickly apparent to
the student if he has the opportunity to code, set up and
operate a machine.

A less specific, but perhaps more important need
for machine tims is for thesis research and for the gereral
research program carried out by the faculty, which engenders


the thesis research and which maintains the scientific tone
of the Institute. Research of this type should not be handi-
capped or abandoned because of difficulty of acceas to high-
speed computers. If special financing 18 required for each
piece of research which needs computer time, then the educu-
tional research program will not advance as it should. Cerx-
tain restraints on the free use of machines may have to be
imposed, but these should not be financial omes.

The Institute is at present gfforing the necessary
special courses basic for training. There 1s a senior eleg-
tive course, 6.25, which provides a survey of machines and
their general properties. Course Mill provides the basic
mathematical background for numerical analysis, and courses
2.215, 6.535, 6.536, 6.537, 6.538, 6.567 and 6.568 are advanced
courses in coding, programming or in basic machine design
principles. If sufficient access to working machines could be
scheduled for the students in these courses, plus students in
other Jjunior-senior engineering courses which could devote 2
portion of their time to the principles of computing machines,
then the Institute would be in the forefront in regard ©o
training in this field.

At present, however, the Institute has made no
direct provision for the use of computers as laboratory
equipment, or for general educational research, as outlined
above. What use is now in effect 1s of the nature of a by-
product. Several large research projects need machines for
their own work, but are willing to allow others in the Insti-
tute to use the equipment when it happens to be idle. Whirl-
wind actually schedules a certain fraction of its time foy
users {rom outside the project. But as training and genexal
research needs increase, and perhaps project funds decline,
this process of satisfying our educational requirements by
"gathering up the crumbs" from the projects will be less and
less adequate. The Institute must make arrangement for the
direct financing of computing equipment adequate to train the
next generation of engineers and scientists. :

This is not to say that special projects should be
discouraged from getting and using their own machines or thit
we should frown on special financing for the design and
building of special-purpose machines. These activities have
their own important place in the gemeral Institute program.
But we cannot expect these special projects sutomatically to
satis cur educatioral requirements in the field. We do not
attempt to run our laboratory courses by occasionally borrow-
ing the use of DIC equipment. If we are to train engineers
and scientists in the use of electronic computers, we must

plan for the necessary financing and not expect that the in-
structional requirements for machine time wlll come as un-
planned by-products of projects financed for other purposes.

The Needs - As a matter of fact, the finencial and organiza-
tional requirements to provide machine facilities for train-
ing and educational research, which are the subject of this
report, are not very large, compared to the budgets of several
existing projects concerned with computing equipment.

The needs of the Institute for computing facilities
are, of course, manifold. Projects have been formed, and
others probably will be formed, to design and construct
special computing equipment, as part of our contribution
toward the general task of the mechanigation of industrial
operations. Other DIC projects use, and will use, computing
equipment as tools to help them carry out their project
assignment. This report has nothing to suggest concerning
these project machines and their use, beyond pointing out
that it is unrealistic to expect them also to satisfy our
educational needs. Such projects arise when an "industrial
requirement" arises and when someone in the staff has great
enough interest and enthusiasm to get the requisite backing
and to organize the project. They are important for the
Institute as a whole, but they are only incidental to the
problem discussed in this report.

Until recently the computing machines used pri-
marily for imstructional purposes have been small ones,
bought with individual department budgets and maintained with
little cost. ‘For example, The Aeronautics Department has

an electronic analogus machine for instructional and re-
search purposes. |

This report is also not concerned with such equip-
ment. Departments will buy such equipment as they need it
and will arrange for its maintenance. Arrangements for the
use of the equipment by other departments can be made quite
informally.

Where the problem arises is in providing the larger
pieces of equipment, such az the IBM machines and the large
digital electronic machines. For the next ten years, at
least, such equipment will be too costly for a single de-
partment to carry on its budget, and will be capable of

serving a wider clientel than a single department. Assum-

ing that several hundred undergraduates are to be given
some practical experience with such equipment, a battery of


ol}w

machines such as an IBM, No. 605, and a Card Program Cal-
culator, plus one high-speed machine, such as Whirlwind I
or the IBM Defense Calculator could easily handle the load
and still have time available to schedule thesis and general
research problems. Possible budgets for such a combination
are discussed later.

It would, of course, be necessary to have a small
staff to help in the instruction and to keep the equipment
running effectively. If all equipment were IBM, mo main-
tenance staff would be needed; if Whirlwind I were part of
the combination, two or three technicians would be required.
It would be desirable, for at least two reasons, to keep the
service staff small in number. The obvious reason is the
budgetary one. Another reason is that it would be desirable
to have the thesis and research computing handled as much
as possible on a "self-service" basis; the persons do the
research and desiring the results should help in the ¢oding
and should help run the equipment. Apart from the cational
value of the self-service policy, it is true that most effec-
tive utilization of machine computation comes when t
doing the research learns enough about coding and machine
operation to be able to adapt the general procedures té his
particular problem. In addition, such self-service réguire- -
ments will automatically limit demands on the equipment ‘to
those problems where the need of machine computation is real.

Yhen coding and processing is all done by a service staff) fi
the temptation is great to "put a problem on the machine
before it has really been thought through, and much wast
of machine time results. o

 
 
   
 

 

The staff of the machine center should, of ures:
be large enough so that it will not be continually burdened
with service duties, or it is liable to josg its enthusiasm.
The senior members of the service staff should have some time .
to carry on research of their own, to work on special coding
programs and to improve machine operation. An appropriate od
staff would meed to include two or three members of the faculty,’
from several departments, who would each spend part of their
time planning and supervising the use of the equipment by the
various laboratory courses of instruction which include
machine operation in their curriculur. There must, of course,
be a full-time supervisor, who would be responsible for
scheduling and maintaining the equipment and for supervising
the service staff, which would consist of two or three senior
coder-technicians and two or three operators. If Whirlwind I
is part of the combination, at least two maintensnce tech-
niicians would also be needed. Such a staff could handle
both course load and gemsral research needs if the general

as

  

research work were carried out on a self-service basis
outlined above.


Therefore, the computing machine re irements f
training and educational research at the Institute are for
a small battery of machines, punched-card amd electronic digi-
tal, with ancillary equipment, plus a staff of 6 to 10 full-
time coders and operators (amd perhaps maintenance men) and
part of the time of 2 or 3 faculty members. This should be
financed so that it will not have to cherge for each use of
the machines. Of course, if some project wished to have :
some computations done and there were time available after
educational needs were satisfied, the project should be
charged for the machine time it uses, and the money thus :
collected could go into a reserve fund, either to lighten :
the financial load carried by the Institute or else to be iy
used to purchase new equipment. But the financing should be \
adequate enough 20 that educational and general research use
can be free, sc that priorities in scheduling machine time
can be decided on the merits of the work rather than on the
ability to pay for the time.

Equipment of the sort mentioned is here at the
Institute now, but is not financed or organized so as to
satisfy the educational needs outlined in this Report. Some
of the simpler IBM equipment is here as part of the Office
of Statistical Services, to handle the mechanized part of
the Institute's record-keeping. The 605 and CPC is also a
part of the Office of Statistical Services, but the remtal
for these machines is paid entirely by a number of projects,
which use most of the working time of machines and staff.
If they were to be used in whole or im large part for labora-
ory courses and for educational research, some other way of
financing their rental would have to be worked out. At
present, two minor pieces of IBM equipment have been assigned
to the Institute, rent-free, for educational use. By them-
selves, they are entirely inadequate for the educational
program we will have to provide. But it is possible that
TERM would be willing to donate enough more machines, rent-
free, to make this a useful instructional unit. In such a
case, vhe Institute would onlw have To finance the n=laries
of the service staff.

Whirlwind I would be suitable for the high-speed
part of the combination. Another possibility would be an
IBM 701, which we do not have at present. If Vhirlwind were
to be kept for educational use, the service staff would have
to be augmented by two or three maintenance technicians and
would have to be still larger if the punch-card equipment were
in a different location from Whirlwind. This additional cost
would be smaller than the rental on an IBM 701, however, so
it would not be advisable to get a TOl for educational use
unless it could be gotten rent-free.


Alternative Solutions - No single best recommendation can

made for satisfying our educational requirements for com-
puting equipment. Several alternative possibilities will be
mentioned, each of which merits further investigation, to
see which is possible and which would involve least finan-
cial burden to the Institute.

1. If the International Business Machine Corpora-
tion were willing to provide the Institute, rent-free, a
604, a CPC and a TOl calculator, in addition to the equip-
ment they are already donating, then the cost to the Insti-
tute would be only for the operating staff, which would be
from 8 to 12 persons, approximately the size of the present
gtaff of Statistical Services. The same staff could operate
the additicnal IBM equipment used by the Registrar's and
Bursar's office. (The donated machines, of course, should
not be used for project or for administrative work.) Wiis
solution would be the most compact and would be probably the
least costly. The equipment could all be located in the
space at present cccupnled by the Office of Statistical
Services, with a small (4 bays) increase. In fact, all the
equipment except the 701 1s already here, though the
and CPC are now being used for DIC work. IPs feasibllity,
of course, depends entirely on the possibility that IBM |
wonld make the equipment (plus their maintenance) available
rent-free; if rents would have To be pald, the cost would
pe entirely too large. :

2. if The IBN Corporation were not willing toc donate
all the equipment mentioned in plan 1, but were willing to add
a CPC to the present donated equipment, we might be able to get
along without the 604, and would use Whirlwind I instead of the
IBM 701. In this case we would have to add two maintenance
technicians, for Whirlwind, to the staff. This arrangement
would only be effective if we moved either Whirlwind or the IBM
equipment so they would be all in the same place and could be
run by the same staff. (Parénthetically, it would be wellnigh
impossible to move Whirlwind I from its present location without
considerable cost and delay.) In this alternative the CPC could
only be used for educational purposes, but a small part of Whirl-
wind time might be sold to DIC projects or to local industry to
help bear the cost. Such expedients are doubly dangerous, how-
ever, for the work would be competing with commeréial computing
outfits and would also be likely to crowd in on the educational
use of the equipment.

5. If the IBM Corporation is not willing to con-
tribute any more equipment than the small amount they are at
present donating, then a possible solution would be to use


-T-

nd I as the central part of the educational combi-

g and to get, in addition, by donation or by purchase,
f the intermediate speed, magnetic drum computers which
now coming on the market. This simpler machine could
rused for Initial instruction and for the simpler research
yroblems, to leave Whirlwind free for the bigier jobs. In
this case, of course, the maintenance technicians would also
‘be needed. Since this combination does not involve IBM

© equipment, it could be quite separate from Statistical

© Services, in which case a separate staff would be needed

~ (though this might be reduced to 7 to 12, including maintenance
technicians, since it would not have to carry the Registrar's
and Bursar's load). Statistical Services would remain as it
is now, a purely IBM unit, servicing The Institute's manage-
ment offices and the DIC projects, and the educational unit
would be a separate outfit. Such an arrangement would, of
course, be more costly than the other two possibllities.

ation - In any case, no matter which of the alter

eT out to be most feasible, it is important that
steps be taken to provide computing machine time for instruc-
tional and educational research purposes within the next
year. The Tnetitute cannot be said to be doing its educa-
tional job in this field adequately unless at least one
high-speed machine and one intermediate machine are avall-
able for such purposes. It is recommended that the suggested

alternatives be investigated in the near future and an»
early decision reached as to which plan to push.
