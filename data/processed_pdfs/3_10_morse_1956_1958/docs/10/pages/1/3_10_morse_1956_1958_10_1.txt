Dear Professor Morse:

Confirming our recent telephone conversation, enclosed is a description and
specification of our available top programing position here at Northwestern
University.

 

If the person objects to the title "University Programer', we can arrange
any title he wishes. More important the job will carry full and appropriate
faculty rank if the man has the Ph.D. "Assistant Director" we hoped to hold
out for a year to see how the person developed administratively, and then
we could get him a good salary advance and promotion the second year.

If you have anyone you can suggest, we would appreciate your calling us
(collect), or writing us immediately.

 

Sincerely yours,

Qozw%
