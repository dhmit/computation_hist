Dear Phil

I am glad to have a description of the project relating to
the use of the high-speed digital computor for social science re-
search. The individuals mentioned in your letter are those most
likely to have both a direct interest and a knowledge of other soc-
ial scientists who would share the same concerns.

Ezra Gleser has agreed to write a memo for us concerning
the problems and possibilities that relate to the use of computors
in social science research. He has arranged to devote a month, or
so, to the preparation of such a memo. I am hopeful thet his thoughts
may have some bearing on the project that you have in hand. He can
be reached at National Anelysts, Inc., 1015 Chestnut Street, Phila-

delphia 7, Pennsylvania.

p.s. OSam Stouffer's name has probably already been brought
to your attention as a possible member for your advisory
committee. Robert Bush, now at the New York School of
Social Work, might also be another candidate. He wes
trained in physics and later got his Ph. D. in social
relations at Harvard.
