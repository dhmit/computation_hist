Digital Computer Laboratory. The Digital Computer Laboratory
has built a large-scale high-speed electronic digital computer

 

called Whirlwind I, This is a general purpose digital machine
and will of course solve Ã©ll problems that can be reduced to
the basic arithmetical operations. It is one of the largest
machines of its type in existence.

The machine utilizes a binary number 8cale and handles
numbers which have 16 binary digits (equal to approximately'

4% decimal places), although it can be programmed to handle
numbers with more digits. Its high speed of operation is
indicated by the ability to perform 5000 multiplications pef
second. Incidentally, most of this time is consumed in getting
numbers to and from storage units.

The problem of storage capacity is always a considerable one
in machinee of this type, and development of Whirlwind to its full
capaclty is still continuing. When finished, it is expected that
it will be equipped to store up to 2,048 words, where s word can
be either a number or a (coded) instruction. At the present time
g8torage capacity is up to about 1,000 words.

Input and output can be arranged in connection with any of
the following units: typewriter, perforated paper tape, maghetic
tape, magnetic drum (to be installed sometime in 1952), or osell-

loscope display. The machine has built-in identity checks and
