month are much the same individuals as were ia the labor force the

month prior whereas im the case of married females with childrem, a ceasider-
able proportio- of those whe are ia the labor force in any given moath
were mot in the labor force the moath before, Unless we form estimates of
this rate of labor force turmover withim cells, we may fail te allocate
labor force participatioa to the members of each cell with aay approxima-
tioa to reelism, Thus we camnot escape the necessity of studyiag the re-
lationship betweea preseat labor force participatioa and previcus laber
force participatica or, iam other words, the autocorrelatiom of labor force
participation over time, Umfortumately, about all that the available
data allows us to de imn this respect is to relate present participatioa

to participatioan during the previous pear,

The comsideratioan of imdependeat variables has led into the third
major aspect of the imvestigatioa, mamely data requiremeants amd availability,
Ideally, what we require is access to observaticas on a sample of imdividuals
over an eoxtemded pericd of time, This means access to the astual questioamnaire
forms or something very close to that, Published, tabulated, cross-
classifications can mever be extemsive emough to sustaim the mmltivariate
statistical amalysis required, mor is it likely that published tabulatioms
will involve the partiemlar variables that are of interest to ws, Unfertumate-

 

ly, most of the observatioms of the type we need are made by the Geverament,
vhich is bound by laws prohibitimg disclosure of information relatimg to
individuals, However, there are ways of providing the necessary cbeervatioms
vithout identifying individuals and we are curreatly exploriag these poesi-
bilities with the Bureau of the Cemsus,

The best source of data coasists of two sets of Univae tapes, based
on the Pebruary and March 1957 Curreat Populatioca Surveys, oa which are re-
corded, respectively, the characteristics of individusls and of families,
These tapes are umusually valuable for ocur purposes for the following reasoas,

mounths of the year, the imdividual schedules permit classifi-
cation caly omn the followimg five variables of imterest:
