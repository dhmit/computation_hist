clidean space containing in 1ts interior the hyperspher.e 24(r) of mqms r
and center at the origin (r<1). Let us a_lways <;onsnder th‘e lgtt.nce .of

terior those lattice points (other than the or.zgm) in a second sphere

except the origin. In fact K will then lie entirely within the second

We let (x;) be an arbitrary point outside of Z4(r), thé}t is, we let

hyperplane through the origin and perpendicular to this lm?, and we
let Z4_; (r; x;) be the intersection of this plane with the solid spht.are
24(r). For our immediate purposes we define k(r; x:) as the (solfd)
cone formed by the segments joining each point of Z4_; (r; x:) with
(x;); and for later purposes we define K(r; x;) as the (solid) cone with
spherical base formed by joining with (x;) each point of Z4(r). NO}v
K(r; x;) will prove useful when we seek the best Cq, since this solid
is a minimal body which any convex body K must contain in order
to contain both Z4(r) and (x:). For our immediate purposes, we need
only note that the convex body K will (easily) contain k(r; %) apd
that the latter body has the very handy value wg_yv9-'R/d for its
volume, where w;=7*2/T(1+%£/2), the k-dimensional volume of the
unit sphere in k2 dimensions.

ON FINITENESS CONDITIONS FOR A CONVEX BODY 545

We now note that «(r; x;) will contain a lattice point (not the origin)
if R2 Ca/r?~". This is a simple consequence of Minkowski’s theorem
on convex bodies [3, p. 60]. For the body formed by the union of
k(r; x:) and k(r; —x;) is symmetric and has volume not less than 24,
Hence there would have to be a lattice point. (not the origin) in each
of the two symmetric halves. From this the theorem follows easily.

3. Best constant. The preceding estimates can be improved
slightly. For instance we may take into account the fact that the
convex bodies, k(7; x;) and its integra] translates, can not pack space
more densely than do the (d—1)-dimensional spheres (which are pre-
cisely their intersections with planes parallel to II(x;)). Then we im-
mediately obtain an improvement of C; to Ct = Cawa_yy 8- V/32—-(d-1)
(where v3/% is the maximum euclidean distance separating the clos-
est points of any d-dimensional lattice of determinant unity). But
using even the lower estimates [2, pp. 23-24] on v4_;, we find the
improvement is not substantial, that is, as d—«, log Cs~log C/
~(d/2) log d. -

Going in the other direction we can show that there is a best con-
stant for Cg as r—0. To recapitulate, our main theorem was deduced
from Minkowsk1's theorem. It could also have been deduced from the
simultaneous approximation theorem, as the remaining proof will sug-
gest, but the constant C; would not have been as good. The converse
of Minkowski's theorem, or the Minkowski-Huwlaka theorem [4], is
inapplicable since the problem is not affine invariant. The converse
of the simultaneous approximation theorem, or (essentially) Perron’s
transferal principle [2, p. 67], is, however, applicable and we shall
now look to it for a proof that a best Cas, which we shall call Cj,
exists.

For the calculation of the best constant, we take a minimal con-
vex body, which is “evasive” of lattice points, namely K*
=K(r; p8:/(Z67)"?), reaching to distance p from the origin in the
direction (6;(=1), 85, - - - , 84). The 6 are chosen, from the Perron
transferal principle, to span (say) a real algebraic field of degree d
(for convenience, 0 <8, <1). Then a constant g (called Cain [2]) will
exist with the property that “the forms | pBx— x|, for 2k <d, admit
a simultaneous approximation no better than (gsp;/“~")=1,” that is,
for ;> Pi(e), the inequality | pfe—pi| = ((gat+€)p) ")~ will hold
for some k depending on p; and ¢, and satisfying 2SSk Sd.

We now let p increase from 7 until it reaches the first value po for
which K* has a lattice point (p:) on its surface. If we took r small

“enough (<7y(e)) then this lattice point would satisfy the inequality
