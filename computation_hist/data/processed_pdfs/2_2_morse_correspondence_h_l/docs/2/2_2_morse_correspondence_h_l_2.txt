Dear Professor Morse:
Since receiving your letter of October 11, 1

have considered carefully the questions raised by the definition

of scope of the work to be done on the IBM 704 which is to be in=-
stalled at MIT under your supervision. 1 came to the conclusion
that it would be helpful to take advantage of your invitation to
visit you as soon as possible, and I am therefore planning to be in
Cambridge on October 26. 1 am scheduled to arrive at the airport

at 9:45 a.m., sO that I should be able to be at your office by about
10:30 a.m. 1 have made arrangements to fly back to New York on the
7 o! clock (pe.m.) plane that same evening so that 1 could meet with
you at any convenient time during the day. Please let me know whether
this is convenient.

I feel reasonably sure 1 can convince you that our work satis-
fies all the criteria mentioned in your letter, except that of lo-
cation in New England, and I feel that its importance may justify
you in granting us some time on your 704%.

Yours very sincerely,

\ paolo er
