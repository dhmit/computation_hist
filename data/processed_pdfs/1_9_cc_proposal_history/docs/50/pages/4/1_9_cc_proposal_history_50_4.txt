ships have been very fruitful in the spread of the understanding
of machine capabilities throughout the Institute, for not only
does the graduate student and hils lmmedlate assoclates learn
about computing machines and their use but, even more important,
his faculty advisors in the various departments have a chance to
learn of the usefulness of the new machines in their specilal
fields. Tpese advisors have sent more students to learn about
machine computation and have initiated more research using machine
results. For example, most of the professors of theoretlcal physlcs
are supervising thesis research in nuclear theory or solid state
theory, the computation of which will be done by Whirlwind or by
the I.B.M. equipment we have. Our research in nuclear reactor

design will have to be done with machine help.

 

Many of our best and most imaginative machine programmers
have been introduced to computing eguipment via these Assistant-
ships. They started out being interested in machlnes as a tool
to help them in their research in physics or chemical engineering
or whatever; they ended by being interested in the operation of
the equipment itself. Such assistantships or fellowships are a
vital part of our training program; their number should be 1in-
ereased as soon as more machine facilitles become avallable.
Future Expansion - With a few exceptions, 1t will notC be necesSsary
to increase appreciably the number of courses concerne√© with
machine computation, if more machine facilitles become avallable;
| what will be important will be the increase 1n contact hours per

gstudent with the equipment. Some of the courses listed above now
