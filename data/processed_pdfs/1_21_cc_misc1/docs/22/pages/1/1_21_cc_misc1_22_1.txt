Dear Professor Morse:

Your attention is invited to the terminal date,
June 30, 1958, of N.S.F. Grant G2940, DSR 7573. If
you plan to continue this research, we recommend that
you prepare an extension proposal at an early date,

A lead time of six months or more is necessary
for many of our research project sponsors to insure

that we have a signed contract or amendment authorizing
continuation of the work.

Please refer to the attachment entitled "Procedure
for Establishing DSR Contracts"â„¢ for information on pe-
search projects handled by the D.S.R. We would be
pleased to offer additional advice and/or assistance in
the preparation of your proposal,

R. P, Webber
Assistant
