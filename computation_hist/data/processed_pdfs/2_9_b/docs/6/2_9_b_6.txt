Dear Mr, Burstein:

This letter is to confirm our discussions concerning the
need for parking permits for the participating colleges working at
the MIT Computation Center,

I would like to request that you prepare a transferable
parking permit card for each of the twenty-eight New England Univer-
sities participating in the Computation Center program. This card
will be issued to the institution and not to a single individual, I
am enclosing a list of the institutions participating in our program,
The card whould contain words to this effect:

Name of Institution

Parking Permit for Use at
the MIT Computation Center,

or words to that effect.

I am certain your experience will serve you in good stead in
selecting the appropriate words, This permit should have an automatic
termination date of June 5,

Sincerely yours,

F. M. Verzuh
Assistant Director

FMV/bf

Enclosure

for use at the individual college.
