When using the DEBUG PACKAGE the following two restrictions are
placed on the programmer:

LANGUAGE DEBUGGING AT OBJECT TIME, J28-6135, in Room 26-153,

1) Logical tape 2, corresponding to physical A3, must be
the printed output tape. This assignment is the normal
assignment at the Center.

2) No more than 1000 lines of printed output can be
obtained through the DEBUG PACKAGE and the estimate of
number of lines of printed output through the DEBUG
PACKAGE must be included on the I.D. card.

When using the DEBUG PACKAGE programs which load beyond
(62032)g will be too large for the system,

III. FAP

FAP (Fortran Assembly Program) will be expanded to include
the operation codes explained in the addenda of the FAP manual,
Also, included in FAP will be the ability to update FAP symbolic
tapes where the input and output tapes are not necessarily the
normal input and output tapes of the system., For a further
explanation, programmers should request FORTRAN ASSEMBLY PROGRAM
(FAP) FOR THE IBM 709/7090, SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FOR THE
32K VERSION, J28-6186, in Room 26-153, Macro-FAP is explained
in this Bulletin, but will not be incorporated into the system
until a later date. '

Other changes included in this version of FAP will be:

1) absolute FAP assemblies produce 22 words per binary
card,

2) all assemblies will be sequenced checked in columns 73-
80, If the FAP cards are out of sequence the assembly:
will take place in the normal manner, but an error
message will indicate' that the cards are out of order,

3) the TAPEN{ pseudo-operation will be made available for
the instructions SDN, SDL, SDH, RDC, and RUN,

Timing for FAP assemblies may be based on the approximation
of 2700 cards per minute, i s gie :

1V, Library Changes

A, (I¢B), (TSB),(E1B) These subprograms have been altered so
that binary tapes are read and written in a new format of
physical records of 256 words, The decrement of the first word
