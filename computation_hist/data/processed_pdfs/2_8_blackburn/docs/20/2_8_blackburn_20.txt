Dear Professor Morse:

In accordance with our agreement at the last faculty meet-
ing, I should like to request authorization for keys for Miss Hires
to Rooms 26-153 and 26-157 now used by the New England universities.
As agreed, Miss Hires will retain custody of the keys and permit
Applied Science Cambridge users to use the rooms whenever they are
not in use by the New England colleges representatives. This will be
of material aid to the utilization of the Center by the Applied Science
Cambridge group during the day time shift,

If you will give your authorization to me in writing,
Miss Hires will be able to pick up the keys at the Buildings and Power
Office.

Very truly yours,

2
