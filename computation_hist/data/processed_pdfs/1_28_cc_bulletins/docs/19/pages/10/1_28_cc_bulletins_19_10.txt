Post-Mortem Request Decks
Post-Mortem mcd e -

A modified version of the post-mortem program, MIPMR1, has beep
m

title card, for example
PMD M100-5-1
(2) Post-mortem request decks are not required to have termi-

nation cards (one merely stops writing PMR requests) although a card

having one of the SAP instructions, HTR, TRA, or TTR, in its operation

field will terminate the deck as before, The variable field of this card

is, however, ignored,

(3) The MIPMRL format for punching binary cards (BIN) has been
eliminated,

The translation phase will assemble the PMD deck and record it
on the BINARY INPUT TAPE, The title in the variable field of the PMD
card may be used during operation time to refer to the request deck,

If symbols are used to specify memory ranges in PMR requests,
then these symbols must be assigned in the MEMORY SYMBOL TABLE when the
PMD deck is assembled, Unlike SAP and BIN decks, no symbol table is
associated with a PMD deck on the BINARY INPUT TAPE .

The SAP Pseudo-operation

TCD S Transfer Card

causes the assembly program to produce a t
the assembly,

ransfer card and to continue

by a disti '
nctive title; . Ip the operator Program we shall do this by sys-

tematically modifying the

title which appears on the SAP title card for
the symbolic deck,

then b
Y convention the first Sub-deck has the title
MlOO-l-l*OO
the second Sub-deck has the title

If the title on the SAP title card is
A*j
where i denotes an integer,

then the title associated with the kth sub-
deck is

A*(i+k~1)
The first example was for the case where the title did not end in the
characters, *i,

The translation Phase records each sub-deck on the BINARY INPUT
TAPE and assigns to them in turn the Systematically modified titles de-
scribed above, These titles can henceforth be used to refer to the sub-
decks, Only one symbol table, however, is recorded on the BINARY INPUT
TAPE (namely the MEMORY SYMBOL TABLE resulting from the assembly) but
this is automatically associated with all of the sub-decks and can be
referred to by writing any of their titles,

If the symbolic deck contains PRG or SMT pseudo-operations
which require that binary cards be produced, then BIN title cards con-
taining the systematically modified titles described above will be pro-
duced for each sub-deck requiring punch-out; moreover, if the title on
the BIN card does not end with the characters, *00, then it will be pre-
ceded by a CST card with a blank variable field, Thus replacing a sym-

bolic deck by a binary deck obtained from a SAP assembly will not, in

general, affect a run Only one punched symbol table per assembly is
3 :

produced, however, and it will always be a part of the first sub-deck
(even if this sub-deck produces no cards other than symbol table cards),

The structure of a binary deck produced by a SAP assembly con-

taining TCD cards is shown below:
