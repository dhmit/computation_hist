Committee on Machine Methods of Computation
January 10, 1951

P. M. Morse and E. Reissner

The Committee continued its discussion of possible courses
at the Institute in machine calculation. .The discussion re—
ported in the second paragraph of the minutes of the January 3
meeting was not continued in any detail because it was felt '
that there was not available a faculty member to teach this
course, either this year or next. It was agreed, however, that
such a course should be discussed further at a later meeting.
The proposal of hr. Forrester (mentioned in the first paragraph
of the minutes of January 3) and Mr. C. w. Adams, concerning a
laboratory course in digital machine methods, was then dis-
cussed. It was felt that several aSpects of the proposal should
be modified before it went on to the Electrical Engineering De-
pertment with the Committee's blessing. Consequently, Mr. Adams
was called and he came over to discuss the matter with the Com-
mittee. After discussion, it was agreed that Mr. Adams should
try rewriting the proposal and to have Mr. Forrester turn in
his covering letter, plus the revised preposal, in the near
future to the Committee again. It was felt that the Committee
then would be able to send this proposal along to the Electri-
cal Engineering Department, suggesting that the course, as
proposed, be given as a special problems course this coming
term, and that, based on the experience of this term, the de-
partment and the Committee would consider later as to whether
this should be made a regular laboratory course with a regular
. Electrical Engineering Department number, beginning next year.

The discussion of contract provisions, mentioned in the
third paragraph of the minutes of January 3, was then taken up.
It was felt that the Committee should, in the near future, make
a recommendation to the Provost concerning such contract
provisions. The Chnirmen asked each member of the Committee to
consider the wording of such a proposal.

Morse reported that he was to attend the Faculty Council
Thursday, January ll, to discuss the proposed activi y of the
