Dear Miss Hill:

In your letter of December 8 you inquire whether the M.I.T.
Compa tation Center had cooperating institutions as does the
Western Data Processing Center. There is indeed such a program,
and a list of the thirty cooperating institutions is enclosed.
This program has been in effect since September 1956. =

Since the installation of the IBM 704 computer here in June
1957, members of the cooperating institutions have prepared programs
and have done research with the use of the computer. To facilitate
these activities, there is in addition a Research Assistant and
Assoclate Program for which an announcement is enclosed.

The educational activities have ranged from short programming
courses to intensive two-week programming courses given both here
at M.I.T. and at several of the colleges, These courses have been
given both by staff members of the Center and faculty members of
the various colleges. You will find further information concerning
these topics in our semi-annual report which we will send you, if
you wish.

Sincerely,

Fo. J. Corbatd
