areas which we feel should be investigated, which are certain to
produce results of immediate interest and which. in addition,
should provide hints as to still more important applications.

. A. One of these is the deeper investigation of machine
logic itself. A computer of the complexity of the 705 is too big
to be able to see immediately how it can "think.“ Host machines
are now programmed to do ordinary arithmetic, a few programs have
“lh'een devised to make the machine obey the rules of Boolean logic
and'some téought has been spent on working out programs to make tn
machine play chess or checkers. in other words to obey the logic
of a game. Different sciences and branches or learning have
their own kinds of thought processes. For example, economics
and genetics each have patterns of thought which do not exactly
duplicate those of physics. Fundamental research is needed to
work out programs, rules of thought for the machine, which correspond
more closely to these other patterns. with a machine of the
flexibility and storage capacity of the 703, such research is wort:
while. It will have to be tackled. at the beginning, by teams of
experts in the field of interest, together with mathematical
logicians who know machine operation.

B. Another general line of attack is/ﬁﬁe field of the
storage and rapid access to information, such as is needed in the
problems of language translation and historical research, for
example. Several schemes of coding of infonmation, so that it can
be found quickly and easily, have been devised on paper, but the
"bugs" in such schemes will only become apparent when masses of
information, of the order of several hundred thousand items, are

to be ordered and sorted out. The new installation at the
