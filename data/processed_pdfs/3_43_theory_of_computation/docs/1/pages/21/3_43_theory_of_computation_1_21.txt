The process is continued until the canonical form
is achiecved, \\

There is also a canonical form for strong
equivalence. Any gbf a is strongly cqu1va]ent
to one of the form (pl — &, &), where c~and &

do not contain pl and are themselves in canonical

form. However, the variable Py may not be chosen

arbitrarily but must be an inevitable propositional
variable of the oripin al gbf and can be chosen to
be any inevitable variable. An inevitable

variable of a gbf (I —¢— F ) is defined to be
either the first propositional variable or else

an inevitable variable of both« and .

A gbf a may be put in strong canonical form
as follows:

1) Use axiom 7 to get all premlses as
propositional variables,.
2) Choose any inevitable variable, say Py

and put a2 in the form (p '~Q%3‘B) by using

axiom 8.

3 The next step is to eliminate occurrences
of p incf\andl3 .. This can be done by the

general rule that in any ecf occurrences of the
premise in the conclusion can be replaced by T
and occurrences in the alternative by F.
However, if we wish to usc substitution and

1f tw gbfs have the same canonical form they//
can be transformed 1nto cach other v1a the ~
canonicai‘form Supp se two gbfs have different
weak canonlcal formns whcn the variables are taken
in the same ordex. Then values can be cnogcn
for the p 's ‘giving different values for the form
pfbying non-cquivalence. In the strong casc,
suppose that two gbfs do not have the same 1n-
evitable propositional variables: Let p be in-
evitable 1n a but not in b Then if the other
a5%1ﬁncd suitable valﬁbs b will \
‘defined with p undefined. HHowever, a will be
undefined since p is inevitable in a which proves
non-cquivalence, Therefore, stron*fy cquivalent
ghbfs have the same inevitable variables, so let
one of them be put in front of both gbfs. The
process is then repeated in the conclusion and
alternative etc. '

The general kind of conditional expression

(pl e L S en)

    

can be regarded as having the form
— e e - e U)eoo
(p, 1 (P, o (p_ LW eeed)
where u is a special undefined variable and

their properties can be derived from those of
ece's,

The relation of functions to conditional
expressions is given by the distributive law
