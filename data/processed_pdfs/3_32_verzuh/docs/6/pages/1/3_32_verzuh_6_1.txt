Dear Mr, Dieterichsg

Many thanks for your inguiry of January 21 con-
cerning possible dociloral students that may be employed by
your company in the f{ield of computers,

I shall inquire from among the department faculty
about the probable plans of some of our students, I suggest
also that you register your needs with the Institute Place-~
ment Office, =20 that they will keep this matter before the

attention of the graduates, I will also pess the word along
to Prof, Morse and to Mr, Forrester,

May I suggest that you contact Dry Frank Versuh
to see vhether he would be interested in your proposition,
While at the present time Dr, Versuh is in charge of our
Office of Statistical Services, our policy is always to
bring before such people opportunities for their advance-
menty, Dr, Verzuh is highly skilled in the field of your
interest and currently teaches one of the graduate subjects
that we offer in our seguence of courses on computation,

The best way for us to arrange a time when you
might vigit me would be for you to telephone at your con-
venience and make a date,

Very truly yours,

GSBtEJM
