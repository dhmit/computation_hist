Dear Phil:

The proposal for support of Research on Digital Com-
puter Operation and Research, of which you sent me an advance
copy, has arrived.

An administrative difficulty has arisen because of the
lack of breakdown of the budget requested of NSF and ONR. In
order to get on with the processing, a letter indicating what
is requested of NSF and how it is broken into budget items will
be most helpful.

oincerely yours,

Lain
