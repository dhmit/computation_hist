In.accordanoe'with our budget discu331on3'with lir. Fo Go Weyl.ONR,
I have prespared & 6emonth sumary of ONR usage of WWl. The attached

: 4wpa§e table contains a brealdown of WW1 usage on the project basis.

During this 6-month interval, ONRfs "free time®™ usage of WW1
breaks down es followss

8s Machine Computation Committee 24,708,63

 

b. Solid Stete and Molecular Theory (Slater)  29,092.74
Go Miscellaneous projects 21,232012
$75,083.49

The total machine usage during this Gmonth period for this type of
work is 18,006.6 minutes, or approximately 300 hours.

I Think the informetion sontained in the following btable, such as
problem number, title, programmer, M.I.T. Department, supsrvisor,
DIC contract number, ONR contract, minutes used, and ¥free tims™ dollar

value, should give Mr. Weyl all the information he needs for budget
discussionss

A consideration of the attached statistices reveals several items
which are worthy of mentione Specifically, some of the thesis ressarch
is quite expensive as illustrated in the case of Jack Uretsky's
problem 235 in which he has spent $13,925 during a 6-month period. As
g matter of fact, he has spent $18,132.70 on this problem since
November, 1954, Similarly, B. Campbell has spent $12,834. on problem 245
during this 6-month period, end $15,863.,35 since November, 1964,
Likewise, Mr. K. Bryan has spent $1,870 during the past six months and

a total of $19,941,60 since November, 1954. I think the 6-month expenditure .

of Slater?s group == $29,092.74 is a fair indication of the .efforts of "
his group. ¥urthermore, his group has spent $47,944,25 since
