Dear Dr. Morse:

It is my pleasure to invite you to the College and University Computing
Center Directors Seminar which will be held the week of July 17 at Endicott,
New York.

This year we are planning a program that should be of value to both the
newcomers and the veterans in this field. In order to accomplish this

there will be dual sessions designed to meet the interests of each group.

In some instances there will be combined meetings when the topics are of
general interest. In the past, this seminar has provided an excellent opportunity
for sharing of experiences and the formulation of future programs.

It has become apparent that the computer and the related mathematics will
result in many changes in the courses offered at the college level. One of the
major topics of discussion will be the problem of curriculum revision.

If you can attend you can enroll for this seminar by contacting your IBM Sales
Representative.

Sincerely,

\ AC”
