in the use of analogue computers, with conventional IBM equipment
and with Whirlwingd I. His Salary will be charged to the Project.

Frank M. Verzuh, who will be assistant director for
operations of the new Center, will ailso assist the Project. As
Director of Statistical Services at MIT 8ince 1946, he has been
connected with the operation Of MIT computational work since 1940,
In this capaclty he has had considerable experience with the
utlilization of various analogue computing equipment--differential
analyzersa, etc., as well as g complete line of digital machines
ranging from the IBM Type 601 through the Type 704, He received
a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of
Denver in 1940, a M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from MIT
in 1946, and a Se.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from MIT in
1952. None of his salary will be charged to the Project. '

In addition, the members of the MIT Machine Computation
Committee and of the Computation Center's Advisory Committee on
the cooperative program of the Center (see Appendix A) will be
available for advice and cooperation. From time to Cime, 1f one
of them can supervise a part of the Project, part of his salary may
be charged to the Project.

Full-Time Members of the Pro ject

These will include some former members of the Whirlwind
programming research group, such as Frank Helwig and Sheldon Best,
and others. Some of the best of the IBM research assistants at the
Center will be taken on the Project, for appropriate periods, at
full time, after they have finished their graduate work and relinquished
their assistantships. ' |
