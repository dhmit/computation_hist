Dear Carl:

The wore I see of 701 and 704 installations, the more
T'm convinced that quieting the alr gonditioning iz not & minor
problem but a real serious one, that it will require careful
treating of the ducts and probably 21so the individual wachines
if the words "demonstration area" and "instructional purposes”
are to be other than a mockery. I also hear that the architects
have not F! consulted with Bolt, Beranek and Newman about this
pro\;lem, n spite of the fact that Peterson suggested thia two
months ago. -

 

1f the main computer room ends up like the ones 1've
seen, with poorly des duct-work and no treatment around the
units giving rise to 70-90 db background, I'm going to refuse to
accept the installation entil it is fixed--and fixing badly designed
ducts 1s always expensive!

 

Can you see whether B, B and N can be called in before
it 18 too late?

Yours,

Philip M. Morse, Director
