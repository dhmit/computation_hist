Dear Professor Morse:

Each year we include in the Foundation's Annual Report
a section of photographs showing some of the activities to which
the Foundation is giving assistance. In the Report for 1956 we
should like very much to have the Computation Center represented,
and I am writing now to ask whether by the first of April you
would have any pictures that you could send us of the new digital
computer.

We like wherever possible to use pictures having some
human interest, so that it would be helpful if the machine could
be shown in operation. If this will necessitate the taking of
special photographs, and you are willing to arrange for them, the
Foundation will be glad to pay for three or four by a professicnal
photographer.

I hope that this request will not present too much of a
problem and that you will be able to provide us with illustrations
for the Report.

Sincerely yours,
Bersih oy
