Dear Dud:

We are in the process of collecting material for a
biennial report to our sponsors. I have a feeling that some
of the material we collect would make & good basis for an
article or articles.

I will keep thie in mind and will get in touch with
you sometime in December.

Sincerely,

Philip M. Norse
