Dear Phil:

Please find enclosed a letter which I have received upon
my return here from Professor fukaszewicz (whom, I believe,
I mentioned to you during our breakfast in Philadelphia).
As you will see, he is a knowledgeable person. I had a
letter before from Professor Kuratowski about him, asking
me to find out where a visit by fukaszewicz would be pos-
sible. Kuratowski is an old Professor of mine. He is now
Director of the Polish Mathematics Institute and a Vice=-
President of the Polish Academy of Science. He thinks very
highly of fukaszewicz.

I enjoyed our short encounter among the philosophers and es-
pecially your very elegant and comprehensive talk. TI hope
we can get together soon to discuss the universe in more de-
tail! Any chance of seeing you here, if you happen to plan
any trips West? TI would be delighted if you could give a
talk here or just spend a day or two in Los Alamos.

With best regards and greetings,

Yours, as ever,

SF
