Dear Professor Morse:

On April 4, 1958 the chairman of the National Joint Computer Committee,

Dr. Morton Astrahan, wrote to the Academy of Sciences in Moscow to suggest
an exchange of visits between delegations from the USSR and the United States.
In the letter, Dr. Astrahan invited the Russian delegation to consider attending
the Eastern Joint Computer Conference for 1958 at Philadelphia, and to go on
a tour of this country with an itinerary which would be made up after discussion
with the various parties concerned: the officials in the USSR, the officials in
the United States, the organizations suggested on the itinerary, etc.

The negotiations have progressed to the point where the USSR Academician
Toptchiev has replied expressing interest in such an exchange.

The Eastern Joint Computer Conference is to take place on December 3-5 and
past experience indicates that arrangements on these exchanges have always
been rushed and made at the last minute. I am therefore writing to determine
at this time whether you would extend an invitation to a group from the USSR
to visit your institution in connection with computers and computation, should
the exchange materialize and should their interest extend to such a visit. I
realize that this is a highly nebulous request, but it is undertaken for two
purposes: to give you advance indication of the possibility of the event, and
to make sure on our part that a proper itinerary can be arranged. A prompt
response would be very helpful in making arrangements.

Sincerely yours,

Harry H. de

Professor of Electrical Engineering
Vice Chairman, National Joint Computer Committee
