1953] TWO NON-LINEARIZED CONICAL FLOWS 103

Thus z,/z = X.(f) are conical characteristic surfaces for (2.1). A plane tangent to one
of them along the ray z,/z = X, must be tangent to the Mach cone (2.4) based on
u; = w;(X, , X,) with vertex at the origin and must correspond to the tangent to the
characteristic X, = X,(#). Hence the characteristic directions for (2.11) must be those
of the lines through (X, , X,) tangent to the conic

U X% + w)? = (¢ — H(X2XX + 1) (2.12)

with running coordinates X*. The type of (2.11) is hyperbolic, parabolic, or elliptic
accordingly as (X, , X,) is outside, on, or inside (2.12). For a conical simple wave (2.11)
is of hyperbolic type (except possibly on a curve on which the type is parabolic), with
straight characteristics. Furthermore, a region of hyperbolic type adjacent to a region
of uniform flow must be a conical simple wave.

3. Flow along a conical wall. It is well known that swept Prandtl-Meyer flow over a
dihedral angle can be generalized into simple wave flow past a curved cylindrical wall.
Now a generalization to simple wave flow in a trough with boundaries composed of plane
and conical segments will be discussed.

Consider uniform supersonic flow along a plane wall on which  is a line inclined with
respect to the direction of flow by more than the Mach angle. Let P be any point on .
Extend the boundary beyond [ as a cone through ! with vertex P, and eventually join
the cone to another plane segment. Attempt to fit a conical simple wave to this boundary.
Let the origin of coordinates be at P. Describe the boundary by

z; = 1v;(n) (3.1)
where 7 and p are independent. With no loss of generality assume
v, = 1, v = L. (3.2)
Then
v = vyl =10, vl = —1. (3.3)

Assume that the prototype planes pass through the rulings of (3.1). Then

ww; = 0 (3.4)
and the boundary condition on the cone becomes u; = Av; + Bv! for some scalar func-
tions A (x) and B(u). By (3.3) and (3.4) B = A’, so

u;(u) = A(wvi(p) + A" (Wvi(p). (3.5)

Now (2.5) becomes a’A”*(v/"v!" — 1) = (A” — a*) (A + A”)*, where
2 l 2 12
Q' =50y — (1 — 4* — 47, (3.6)

For any curve on the unit sphere the curvature »{” v} = 1. Also, as in Prandtl-Meyer
flow with leading edge v,(x), the normal component of velocity A’ = a = 0. Assume
that the simple wave is an expansion. Then A’ (A + A”) > 0, and
