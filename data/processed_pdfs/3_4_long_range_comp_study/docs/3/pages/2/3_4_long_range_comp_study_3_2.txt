RPQ E 07291
SPECIFICATIONS FOR A MULTYPROGRAMMING PACKAGE FOR THE 7090 SYSTEM

This Peature performe two (2) relatively independent functions
for the 70390 which are required for efficient multiprogramwing
or time=sharing of the system. They are: asutomatic relocation
and variable bounds mwemory protecticn., Both functions are
provided without extending the execution time of any 7030
instruction.

1. AUTOMATIC RELOCATION

A seven bilt register (relocation register) is provided.
When in the relocation mode, these seven bite are added
to the high order 7 bits of all memory addresses,
including '1l' cycles, generated by the CPU. A program,
therefore, written to execute in a particular set of
storage locations can be moved along with its data to any
other location {the increment of course being a power of
256) and executed there.

Two instructions are provided:
1} Set Relocation Mode 짜

Execution of this instruction will place bits 21-27
of 짜 into the relocation register and enter the

" relocation mode. The instruction is indexable and
indirectly addressable. Relocation will not take
piace untll the Instruction following the SRM hasg been
executed. Also, no I/0 traps can occur between SRM and
the instruction following. * Execution of any trap
will take the CPU out of the relocation mode, If the
CPU is in the relocation mode; a) all traps will inhibit
1/0 traps until restored or enabled, aml b) execution
of the interval timer traps (RPQ E89%40) will store a
19 in position 17 of location 6.

2) Store Relocation Indicators 짜V

Execution of this instruction will store the relocation
registeyr in positions 21-27 of 짜. If in the relocation
mode, a "1" will be stored in position "1" of Y. The
instruction is indexable and indirectly addressabie.
