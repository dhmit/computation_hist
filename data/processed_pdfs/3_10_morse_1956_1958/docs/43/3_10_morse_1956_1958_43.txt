bear Sheldon:

At the last meeting of the 704 "steering committee’ it was
; decided to extend your leave of absence until July 1. Please
: return before that if you Possibly can. If your current project
should extend beyond that date, renegotiation will certainly
be possible, but currently your leave of absence will expire
on July 1.

 

We certainly need an expert on the 704 beginning right now to
help us learn the code, but you should certainly try to complete
the Fortran job before returning.

Peg and I would like to extend an unofficial invitation to
come again while skiing is still good.

Hope to hear from you soon.

Good luck,

Dean N. Arden
