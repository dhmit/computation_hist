APPROACH TO MARKOFF'S MINIMAL FORMS
THROUGH MODULAR FUNCTIONS

BY HARVEY Con N‘

(Received March 26, 1954)

1. Introduction

In 1879, Markoll' [7, 3i") derived, by means of continued fractions, an inﬁnite
sequence of integral indeﬁnite binary quadratic forms whose minima are greater
in absolute value than one-third the square root of the discriminant. The method
of continued fractions provides probably the most direct approach and was
used even more intensively as the subject of diophantine approximations de-
veloped [(5]. Nevertheless, a parallel development was started by Frobenius
[5, 2] in 1013, using properties of quadratic forms. In between, however, in
1896, Fricke [4] had considered groups of substitution matrices generating
fundamcntal domains of genus one in the upper half plane. In setting up group
generators, Frickc had made use of identities of the type:

(1.1) 35(11):, + “5(8)! + 6MB)? = ©(A)E(B)®(zlli) + EMBAHB”) + 2

and
(12) 9(3118) + @(A) = E(B)@(;l1§),

where A and B are real unimodular matrices and C5 is the trace. The veriﬁca
tion of these identities is straightforward, (compare [1, pp. 472, 481]), yet the
close resemblance of these identities with Markol'l"s equation and its recursion
formula, (equations (5.5) and (5.3 bis) below), seems to have somehow escaped
notice.

In this treatment, we give a new derivation of Mai'kol'l"s minimal forms, char-
acterized by arithmetic restrictions on Fricke’s problem.

2. Fundamental Domain

We start with a fundamental domain of genus one in the z~plane belonging to

some group 9 with a speciﬁc representation in real unimodular linear substitu-

tion matrices, denoted as follows:
