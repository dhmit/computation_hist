the rationality of 4 and the boundednegg of the partia] quotients in the simple
continued fraction for z.

Although any real function of the reg] variable g, invariant undey the
transformations of the modulay group, 1s eithey constant oy totally discon-
tinuous, there gre functions of 4 complex variahJe T, analytic in the upper
half plane, ang Possessing the desired invariance, Aside from the constant
function, thege So-called moduylgy functions all haye essntial singularities on
the real axig, Our problem ig then that of investigating the influence of the
diophantine character of 4 real number 2 op the essentiq] singularity of
certain modulay functions at 4.

Hardy ang Littlewood [3], [4] carried out such ap investigation for
the purpose of setting bounds op certain exponentig] Sums (given by the
Jacobi thetq tunctions on thejy boundary circle) by studying thege functions
near the singularity in  question. (?onversely, Wintner [7] analyzed the
behavior of the Dedekind n-function by considering the coeflicients in ijtg
POWer series expansion. Although we present a discussion of the singularities
of certain modular functions as related to the singularities of the terms of
the infinijte series Tépresenting them. our objectives will be primarily in the
realm of function theory, since we shall, for instance, demonstrate function-
theoreticg] Properties in the large on the basis of the behavior of modular
functiong near singularities.
