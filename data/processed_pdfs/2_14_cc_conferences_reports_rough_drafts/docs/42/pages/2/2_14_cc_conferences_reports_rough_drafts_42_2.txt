deterministic model. @herefore, there was being attempted a
simulation model which would explain the current behavior and which
could be used in the future for further studies. Other problems
which were similar to the third problem are the case of the Boston
Fire Department and that of operation of a steel mill.

At 10:50, Morse summarized two classes of problem; (1) those
with time variability and (2) those with definite time intervals.

He discussed the purpose of sinulation as being (1) to explain or
test; and (2) that after the simulation is performed, the resultant
simulation program offers a procedure for looking at the complex
operation as to relating statistical properties.

Talk drifted around to explicit machine properties which
might be d√©sired, and Baker queried whether special purpose instructions
might be useful for distribution function look-up. Galliher brought
up the need for random numbers. Hogett, Galliher, Kimball, Moller
and Morse then became involved in detailed discussions of the
desirability of using Poisson distributions versus arbitrary distri-

bution functions Tchebyschev polynomials aporOX1mations and SO

forth. \

At 11:15, Kimball spoke. He said that his examples are
similar to Galliher's and mentloned that in his opinion a multi-
controlled computer sharing common memory is a possibility of a
computer improvement. He said the objective in his problems is to
find the best set of operational rules; for example, the method of
Box. However, since the difficulty of the Box technique is the

possibility of overlooking a variable, he feels that dynamic programming
