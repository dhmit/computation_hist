Your letter of Hanuary 8 errived several days ago and we are
very pleased with your whole~heerted ccoperation in allowing us %o
partioipate in the SHARE program. At the present time we do not have
any of the Proceedingas of the first three SHARE meetings, and henoe
your letter wae vory weloome since 1t clarified a number of points
regarding "requiremerts and qualifioations™s I have written te
Dr. Greenstadt, 1Ly Corporation, requesting copies of the Proeeedings.

I am sure you understand tihat we have not had time to make an
appreciable sontribution to the available 704 assembly and oampiling
prozramse However, as soun a8 we "catch 1p", I believe we will be
sble to maks contributions.

I am looking forw@rd to the San Francisco meeting and the Prooesedings
of the fourth EHARE meeting which will be held on February 6 and 10,
respeotively. I certainly appreciated reseiving your notices of the

meeting and the enclosed hotel reservation blank, We have discuszssed
the question of how may psople to send to San Fransiseo, and decided that
at best we will only send one person since we do not have too much to
eorntribute. However, 1 expeot this to change, and you will see more
of the staff at the forthooming SHARE meetings.

In olosing, I again wish %o thank you for your assistance in
getting us on the SHARE progrem.

Sincerely yours,
