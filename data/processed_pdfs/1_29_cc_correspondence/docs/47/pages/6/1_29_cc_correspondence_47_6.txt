APPENDIX II

ADDOV  Check lights after floating-point addition.
Celling Sequence: FAD

TSX ADDOV, ),

If lighte indicate en overflow, error stop occurs at ADDOV + |

flow AC is set to zero.

MULTO Check lights after floating-point multiplication.
Calling Sequence: FiP

TSX MULTO, L

On AC under-

Ovefflow causes error stop in MULTO + 3 or MULTO Â¢ 6. AC underflow gives AC

Gero

DIVCK Check lights after floating-point division.
Calling sequence: FDP

TSX DIVCK,L

Divide check light causes error stop in DIVCK + 1. MMQ set to zero on MQ

underflow. MQ overflow causes error stop in DIVCK + 1l.

All routines normally return to X + 1.
