RE: Proposed IBM Computing Center at MIT

The purpose of thismemorandum is to consider some of the factors involved in
operating a new MIT computing center containing a Type 704 EDPM machines and
other auxiliary IBM machines. It is assumed that the 704 will be used four
shifts; however, only two of these are to be used by MIT. The following cost
estimates are therefore confined to a two-shift mode of operation (80 hrs/wk).

INSTALLATION OF 704 MACHINE

704 Space Requirement = 2,400 sq. ft.
Power Requirement = 138 kw
Alr Conditioning = 25 tons

Operation & Maintenance Staff = 5 + 5 = 10 people
(2 shift operation)

Total space reguirementis for analysts, programmers, operators, and administra-
tive personnel, auxiliary maclines, 704, ete. = 7,000 sq. ft. minimum,

ESTIMATED BUDGET REQUIREMENTS FOR 12-MONTH PERIOD

Digital Computer Group Statistical Rervices

 

Salaries & Wages = $122,360 $38,617.44

Materiels & Supplies = 8,83¢ ) 12,000.00

Direct Charges = 1,061 )

DIC Overhead = 37,761

Machine Rental (604 + CPC) 29,376.00
$175,016 $79,993.44

POSSIBLE MEANS OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT

It is assumed that there will be no machine charges for the IBM Type 704
machine and that the present auxilixry machines in the Statistical Services will
be supported by the usual administrative appropriation ($17,198.00). It is
suggested that the present special machines (604 and CPC) be replaced by a
Type 650 Magnetic Drum Calculator. It will be used to solve certain classes of
small problems we are currently handling in the Statistical Services.

A consideration of the above-described budget reveals that 1,020 hrs. of

704 chargeable time (at $250/hr.) must be realized to recover ihe estimated budget
of $255,000,

There are a number of uncertain factors which strongly influence the above
recommendations:

1) The amount of "sister imstitution” utilisation of the 704.

2) The amount of thesis and non-paying research conducted on the 704.
3) The amount of sponsored non-chargeable time used on the 704.

4) The volume of work done on the 650 and simpler machines.


Memorandum 7/6/55 “De

it is difficult to extrapolate how much "chargeable" use of Whirlwind
has been made since November, 1954. Available records regarding machine and
personnel time transfers for this period indicate that $46,774.65 have been
earned during the period November through June 30, 1955. This figure: does
not include the large amount of work which was done on & free (non-chargeable)

basis or for ONR contracts.
