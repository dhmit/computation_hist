Dear Dr. Benson:

Professor Caldwell of our Electrical Engineering Depart-
ment tells me that your plant is getting an IBM number 704 machine
this fall and that there may be some free time on the machine at
first, which might be available for us to use for pure research
and/or education. Since there is some indication that IBM will
make a 708 available to us about fourteen months from now, we
would certainly welcome a chance to get acquainted with a 704
this year, so we could develop our sub-routines ahead of time.

I would be glad to see you here at Tech to talk this
over, if a visit here happens to be convenient. If it is, please

all my secretary, UN4-6900, extension 357, to arrange a time.

 

1f this is not convenient, Dr. Verzuh and Mr. Arden, of our staff,
will be glad to come to Lynn sometime to see what arrangements can
be made.

Thank you for your offer of cooperation.

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse, Director
Computation Center
