Naval War College
Newport, Rhode Island

Dear Captain Beebe:

Our Assistant Dean of ScÂ¢ience, Dr. Francis Bitter,
has indicated he would like to have lunch with you and your
group on Tuesday, November 13. Dr. Bitter was in the Navy
during World War II znd was in charge cf scme operations
research work done at CINCPAC. Dr. Bitter hopes that you
and your group can go to lunch with him at the M.I.T. Faculty
Club, between 1.00 and 2.00 p.m.

This will necessitate a slight change in schedule.
We are arranging, therefore, that you go to the Barta Building
to see the Whirlwind computer in coperation at 11.30 instead
of 12.30. This will give you time to see the equipment and
then to zo to the Faculty Club for lunch with Dr. Bitter,
You will return to my office or some room nearby at 2 30 as
provided in the earlier schedule.

Please let me know whether this will be satisfactory.
Sincerely,

Philip M Morse, Director
M.I.T. Computation Center
