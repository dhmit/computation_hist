This result is due to Minkowski [4, p. 189]; we therefore simply
note some special aspects of the lemma which tie in with familiar
results. In case there are more than d vectors (and their negatives)
on the surface, let us choose (w;") so as to produce a minimal positive
determinant. Then for d=2 the basis can always be chosen as
(wr, wy) itself, while for d=3 it can be chosen as (w;, w;, w;) or
(wr, @y, (wy +w; +w;)/2), as was known to Minkowski [3, p. 101]. If
K is specialized to an ellipsoid, then for d £3 only the basis (w;)
will occur.

3. Reduction to finiteness. In the search for critical lattices, we
first restrict the K-admissible lattices to the subclass having d inde-
pendent vectors on the surface of K. This is no restriction since every
K-admissible lattice can be contracted to a K-admissible lattice with
the further property. We then let (w;") be such a set of d independent
vectors. By the finite bases lemma, the lattice has as its basis a set
() chosen from among the finite collection in (2).

Then the conditions (1), subsidiary to the minimizing of the de-
terminant of the @, can be rewritten as d( Zp,- Q) =1, where (p:)
are still all integral lattice points, not the origin and where equality
is achieved when the argument of ® is one of the vectors .

convex body Kj in the p-space by means of the inequality in the p::
®( ZP:‘ ) £1. Furthermore K, contains the 2¢-hedron determined
by the vectors +(ay, 0, 0, - - - Z0) taa G 0 0), =

t (@i, @az, @as, * * -, @aa). But these 29-hedra are finite in number
one for each basis, and they contain the origin and hence a hyper-’
sphere of radius p4, depending on d alone. To be more specific, using
the estimates a - - - 244 <d!and g;;2 ay;| for £>; (an easy conse-
quence of (2a)), we find that for instance Pa=d=12(d1)~¥2, Hence
by the main theorem of the companion paper [1], % will contain no
p-integral lattice points, other than the origin, in its interior if it
fails to contain those in a hypersphere of radius Capg—(d-D,

Thus the system of inequalities (1) can now be replaced by the
finite collection of the finite systems (one system for each basis)

In principle, of course, we select the basis whose system gives the
smallest determinant; and in each system we would have had to
change some inequalities to equality and to ignore many more.
When d> 3, however, there seems to be no easy way to determine a
minimal system.
