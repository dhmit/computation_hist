- of withdrawing from the Research Assistantship program for the remainder of this =~
- year. They do, however, plan to make application for participation in the pr:{rm e
- next year provided a suitable graduate student interested in computational work -

 

 

 

 

Two of the Research Assistants, Mr. R.W. Taylor and Mr. R. E, Trocchi will
complete their work for the Masters' Degree this academic year. Mr. Taylor
has a military obligation to fulfill upon completion of his work. Mr. Trocchi
has been interviewed by the IBM recruiting representative from Poughkeepsie.
Dr. M. J. Carrabes has been very active in conducting seminars for staff and
faculty and in advising Mr. Taylor and Mr. Trocchi on computational problems.
Although he is withdrawing from the Research Associateship which he holds, he
will continue to be active in computational work,for example, he will conduct a
704 course which will include practical traiming at the MIT Computation Center
starting in about two weeks. This course will be given to approximately six
members of the faculty at Northeastern. | o

 

 

 

Prof. Harold Stubbs of the Mathematics Department has recently beenappointed to
that position. He is planning a research program for next y2ar which ug
probably iavolve computational work. He is therefore quite interested in taking
the 704 course which Prof. Carrabesis giving in February. ‘

When 1 spoke with Dr. White he simply reiterated the reasons for Northeastern
withdrawing from the Research Assistantship program at this time but with the
idea of resuming participation in the program during the academic 1958 - 59.
