Subject: Approvsl of Requests for amputation Time at the Center

 

l. The Center has set up the rule that on research workers,
tseulty or students. the risk to use the equipment of the Center in the
course of their research, must apply for approval or their computing plans
Ind for assignment of neckline time, using the forms enclosed. Machine time
tor unclassified research, connected with graduate education, is tree, but
we need the tormelisl of so spplicctien so as to have the chance to look
over conputstion plans before they are started. to see whether they are
feasible and to see whether we can allocate the required time. (no classified
work 1111 be done at the Center.)

2. The Center is asking that each Department Head approve each such
application which involves either faculty» members or students in his department,
before the application comes to us. We feel this added requirement is desirable
because:

 

1. It gives you s chance to see what use your department is
making of the Center (you may wish to keep a record of the forms you
have OK'd.)

2. It. gives us the benefit of your judgement of the value of
the proposed research to the educational activities carried on by
MIT. We do not ask you to Judge the feasibility of putting the
problem on u computing machine (we will do that); we do ask that
you approve only these requests which represent useful research in
the field of your department and which contribute non—trivially to
the education of one or more students.

3. We do not ask that you approve requests for machine time
from Ben projects. involving only 883 staff members in the prosecution
of the research of their project. Such purely project computation,
usually of a more routine nature, will have lower priority in machine
time assignments, will be expected to contribute financially to the
support or the Center, if time is assigned, and arrangements for
this work will be discussed between the Center and the Project

Supervisor directly, without needing to bother you. In any case, the
work must be publishsblc.

 

4. To approve an application, you should sign in the box on the
right—hand column, marked "Inst. Rep, Approval", circled in red in the enclosed
sample. We will not accept an application without such a signature"
