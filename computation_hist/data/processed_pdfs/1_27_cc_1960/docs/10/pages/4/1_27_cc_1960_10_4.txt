the machine, though only a fraction

techniques are needed.

These, and many other programs now in progress, such as
the character-recognition studies ~ T m ". , the research
on economic forecasting and on operational behavior using large~
scale simulation techniques, should be of particular interest to
IBM, for they have direct bearing on the progress of computer
design and utilization. They represent the sort of cooperative
research between experts in iifferent fields which MIT does so
effectively, and they involve the combination of research and
eincatioh for which HIT is preueminent. This Work deserves
support by IBM, in addition to the educational activities which
are already being supazigegagy the present contribution of the 704.
They can most effectivelyhby the installation of a 7090, replacing
the 70%, in the near future; MIT will then be able to provide
the staff and ancillary equipment to push ahead with dispatch.
Because of the "inter-connectedness” of much of this research,
it can best be carried out (perhaps it can only be carried out)
in the atmosphere of mutual cooperation and exchange of infor~
