MEMORANDUM
To: Mr. N, McL. Sage
From: Professor Philip M. Morse
Date: 29 January 1953
Subject: Contract NSori 06001, Task Order I proposal for

extension beyond current expiration date for the
period 1 July 195l through 30 June 1955.

We propose to continue work on the subject contract as restated
in Amendment 13 for an additional year covering the period 1 July 195k
through 30 June 1955, The work will consist of a coordinated research
program in applied mathematics utilizing facilities in the Center for
Machine Computation including the Whirlwind Computer in the Digital-
Computer Laboratory., The work will include but not necessarily be
limited to the following:

(1) research in methods of numerical analysis and the formulation
of scientific problems for machine solution, together with the training
of personnel in these methods;

(2) support of the scientific and engineering applications group
of Project Whirlwind so as to make the computer useful and available for

the above research, and partial support of the maintenance of the Whirlwind

Computer and research into digital computing machine components.

The Air Force is making a large contribution to the support and
extension of facilities of the Whirlwind Computer. Its use will be
shared by the Air Force and ONR, It is understood that details of
the program here proposed will be worked out from time to time with
the technical officer,

There follows a breakdown for the possible expenditure of $285,000
for one year on the above two items, Unless otherwise stated, salaries
are for full time work, Overhead rates are provisional,
