BULLETIN

Schedule of Changes

According to the present schedule, Thursday,
November 30, will be the last operating day for the 709,
The 7090 should be operating by the first of the year.
The 1401's - we are getting two - will arrive a few
weeks later, Until the 1401's are operating, the
Center will continue using its present peripheral
equipment.

Double Precision and Complex Arithmetic

The new version of Fortran, now on the system tape,
has the double precision and complex arithmetic feature
described in the IBM T700/7000 DPS Bulletin entitled:

2h 10 090 Fortran: Double Precision and Complex
rithmetic available, on request, in the Consulting Room,
206-153. You should also receive a list of the available
double precision and complex arithmetic subprograms
with that bulletin, These subprograms are not on the
library tape, but should be avallable in the open files,
Even the floating add and floating subtract operations
are performed by subprograms so, if you intend to run
an XEQ job, be sure you include all the subprograms
you will need.

Warning: This feature wlll not be available on the 7090
Fortran which should be 1n use late next year. Source
programs using the D and I modal codes will not be compatible
wlth that system,

MADt ran

MADtran, a program for converting Fortran source
programs to MAD source programs so that they can then be
compiled in MAD should be avallable in a few weeks, At
the moment, the staff is working on the write-up for
this program,

New FAP

There is a new version of FAP described in the

IBM 709/7090 DPS Bulletin Fortran Assembly Program (FAP)
for the IBM 7109/7090, J28-6098-1 which is available in
he Consulting Room, 206-153. is version, which
includes the new psuedo-ops MAX, MIN, OPD, etc. will be
on our system tape within the next month. The present

version of FAP is a subset of this new version and no
changes need be made to present programs.

Fortran/FAP Monitor System Changes

Several changes of interest have been made in the
past few months:

June 20, 1961 New version of (F2PM) that supersedes
all existing versions. New (F2PM) is
one complete subprogram and allows
symbolic breakpoint post-mortems
called by CALL FTNBP (see CC-167,
Supplement 1).

Due t6 the pending addition of MAD to
the system tape, the following
necessary revisions have been made:

BSS revised to accept MAD
compiled subprograms,

Library subroutines revised so
that they may be called by either
Fortran or MAD compiled programs.

Subprograms BCDIO, BINIO, TPMOV,
SETUP, and LISTM added to the
library. These routines perform
BCD input/output, binary input/
output, tape manipulation,
Initialization of FFT and F2PM
and do list manipulation for MAD
programs,


Page 3

July 21, 1961 Library changes made: XL@C sub-
programs corrected, ,MTX corrected,
and the latest assembly of (F2PM),
The terminal post-mortem section was
changed so that 1f blank cards
.appear in the deck, termination of
(F2PM) does not occur but reading

â€œcontinues until an F2PM request card
or an end-of-file is reached,

3

September 21, 1961 Library change made: Multiple copies
| of several subprograms have been
placed on the tape so that one pass
over the library tape is guaranteed
when BSS 1s searching for "missing"
subprograms,

Latest version of the MAD compiler
placed on system tape. (See CC-181
for more details,

Computation Center Memoranda

CC-182 Common Programming Errors -
September, 1961, A 1list of
common errors made by users of
FMS,

New FMS Subprograms

Recent additions to the FMS Subprogram fille
Include:

l. LAGIN - A FAP version of the subroutine
GE LAG, a Lagranglan Interpolation routine.

2. RCC 1 and 2 - Two routines for converting
Row binary cards to Column binary card
images on tape, Column binary cards can be
punched from these tapes,

3, ACLl1 - An absolute column binary card on-line
loader,

None of these routines are on the library tape.

The T7090 ~ Things to Start Thinking About

Although the T7090 is, in most respects, compatible
with the 709, there are a few points you should
remember:

1, Tape Density - The Center's T7090 wlll have all
Mod IV 729 tape drives (the high-speed drives},
The normal mode for these drives wlll be high-
density. Tapes that you have now are low- -
density and, though we don't propose you re-
wrlte your tapes, you must be careful to note


Page 5

   

that they are low-density on your request cards,
Similarly, if you are producing tapes for other
installations, low-density is more universal
than high-density. Normally, the user should
not use the Set Density instruction.

2. Speed - We expect to get a factor of about
three increase in Speed over the 709. Remember
this in your time estimates,

5. Scope -. The cathode ray oscilloscope will no
longer use copy-logilc, Routines presently
working on the 709 must be converted, The
Center's staff will, of course, convert those
subprograms that are on the library tape.

The 1401's - Things to Start Thinking About
oF 10 otart Thinking About

The 1401's are in some ways not compatible with
present equipment, You should take careful note of
the following:

l. Program Controlled Listings = ALL printed
output will be listed under program control.
(Printed form controlled by the first
character of the record.) This Will be
controlled by the 1401 program, not by a
Simple switch setting. Most of our users -
all FMS users - are already committed to
this procedure, but if you have a program
not now using program control, you should
convert.

 

a. Space Suppression - This is a Speclal
feature we hope to have on our 1401s,
Even 1f we do have Space suppression, -
you must be aware of this difference -
the 1401 printers space after printing
the line, not before, as our present
printers do. Thus the Space suppress
symbol "+" should be in the record
after which you do not want Spacing to
occur. For example, FPRMAT (2H+A/3H B)
would print AB.


Page 6

b. Triple Space = This may be accomplished
by using the symbol "-", For example,
FPRMAT 1H -e eee :

Card-to-Tape - ALL card-to-tape records will
include the "look-ahead bits" in the last four
characters of the record, All Fortran routines
accept this type of record.

Length of Printer Records - Records to be
printed on the 1401's may be 132 characters
long as against a maximum of 120 on the
present equipment.

Saturday Operation

The Center will continue to be open every
