COMMITTEE ON MACHINE METHODS OF COMPUTATION
Minutes of the Firgst Meetin
Academic Year '52-'5%

Persons Present: C. W. Adams, S. H. Caldwell, H. Feshbach,
J. W. Forrester, C. C. Lin, P. M. Morse,
and E. Reissner

The Committee considered the case of S. H. Sidney in the

. Civil Engineering Department, who was suggested for an assistant-

ship. Not enough detail as to the applicant's ability, in the
form of an application or letters of recommendation, was at hand
for the Committee to come to a final decision. The discussion was
put off until our next meeting, the week of September 29.

- Morse reported that Messers. Martino, Storey, and Caldwell
will not be appointed for the coming year, which leaves some funds
available for one or two additional appointments for the coming
year. lMorse also reported that ONR had requested the Project to
support the work of Dr. W. Albertson as Scientific Advisor to the
Naval War College. This question i8 in the hands of Stratton and
Killian for policy decision; Morse will report their decision.

ONR has agreed that the arrangement will, in any case, be of one
year's duration and that additional funds to make up the cost will
be provided if necessary.

Forrester and Adams reported on the allocation of time
on Whirlwind for the coming year and requested the Committee's help
in determining priorities. About half the machine time will be
used by Project Lincoln; of the remaining half, 1/4 of the time will
be needed for Adams's group for program development and specialized
training (about 30 hours per month). Forrester suggested that the
remaining 90 hours per month be divided roughly as follows:

Long-range Commitments --cevece--- 20 hrs. per month
Machine Computation Fellows8 ----- 10 hrs. per month
Other Educational Activities
(including thesis work) --------- 29 hrs. per month
Short-range academic and
DIC WOPK â€”--eecrcccccmccwcccceeae 10 hra. per menth
Work requested by ONR --ccccce-a-- 5 hrs. per month
Industrial (ILO) probiem8 ------- 6 hrs. per month
Una@signed -----c-cccccccccccccca 10 hrs. per month
TOTAL 90 hrs. per month

-

This general allocation seemed reasonable to the Committee.
After some discussion it was agreed that the Project should go very
slow in taking on long-range commitments and that less than 10 or
the proposed 20 hours per month should be allocated now.
