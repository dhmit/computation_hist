Minutes of the Seventh meeting of the
Committee on Machine Methods of Computation ‘ -2-

Committee and its present status. He said that it was hoped
that this would complete the formalities connected with the
formation of the Committee. Morse also reported that it was
not yet definite that Verzuh would be given leave of absence
the second term of this year, and that he would try to see
Stratton before the next meeting of the Committee.‘ He also re-
ported that the computation seminars would be continued next
term. Mr. Lening (and perhaps Dr. Draper), now in charge of
the differential analyzer, will be present at the next meeting
of the Committee 9:30 A.M., January 17, to discuss the future
of the differential analyzer.
