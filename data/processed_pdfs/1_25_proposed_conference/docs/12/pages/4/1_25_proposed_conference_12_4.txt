Directors, and also to university and governmental authorities
who are involved in creating new and supporting existing Com=-
puting Centers. The following two paragraphs summarize the
concensus in general terms; details are given in Appendiges D +o He

High speed computing equipment has already become a
necessary part of the educational and research facilities of
most U.S. univeraities: general knowledge of the use of this
equipment is even now expected of gradmates in many fields of °
science and engineering. Basic techniques of coding for an
individual machine can be tausht an undergraduate in 5 to 8 hours,
Within the next ten years such:g£g$§56&$ will become as integral
a part of the educational equipment of a scientifiec curriculum
as is a chemistry laboratory at present. Because of its poten=
tialities in non-scientific fields (euch ag in linguistics) ag
well as in scientific ones, a university computing center should
be administered and financed as an institution=-wide facility, ==
analogous in role %o a university library.,

Theugh basic machine coding is quickly taught, even to
those with little mathematics, the problems associated with
exploiting fully the potentialities of present and projected
compuvers are difficult and intellectually challenging, are
demanding the help of specialists fronm a wide variety of fields
and, in turn, are stinulating new developments in nmany existing
fields, from mathematics to linguistics, Experts in the field
of computing science are in very shorsg supplys; the shortage
Wwill remain acute until more colleges train more of thenm,

Graduate gtudents, from several intellectual disciplines, can
profitably participate in this research, thereby lmproving their
placement potential, even in their initial discipline, Knowledg
already mained justifies
