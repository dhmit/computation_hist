.. A Tew years ago a machine user had to become familiar with

SLnary arithmetic and with all the other idiosyncrasies of the primary
Tachine operating code, just as the early auto owner had to be familiar
With spark and choke and clutch. As time goes on it is less and less
necessary for the occasional user to master all these details in order
€0 use the machine, even if he has to devise a program for a new problem.
in the first place, many of the more usual calculations will have been
already programmed so that, for example, if one wishes to compute a
Bessel function or to apply the chi-squared test for the fit of a
formula to a set of data, one need only use the ready-tested program;
In the second place;—it is possible to provide a heirarchy of "trans-
lation procedures™ -- assembly and operator programs, ete. -- whereby
the machine itself will traaslate the desires of the user, exzpressed
in language more familiar to him, into the specialized "language" of
The basic machine code. This wmay be termed programming at the second
