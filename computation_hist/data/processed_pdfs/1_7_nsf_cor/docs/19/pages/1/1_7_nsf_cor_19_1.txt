SUBJECT: laterial for National Science Foundation Proposal

 

In accordance with our discussions regarding the proposal to ESP,
1 am enclosing the following intonation.

nachine Oglenent 2g _t_h_e_ ILLT. mutation Center

 

 

 

'nle ILLT. Computation Center will have a Type 704 Electronic
Data Processing llschine with the following machine complement:
12 magnetic tape units, 2 magnetic cons storage units containing a
total 0! 8,000 words, 1 magnetic drmn unit containing 4,000 words
of storage, the usual on-li__n__e punched card reader, alphabetic printer,
and punched card recorder—'I' as well as the 3 o_£_£-line magnetic tape
controlled printer, magnetic tape controlled card punch, and punched
card-to-magnetic tape converter, respectively. Total machine
”emplement net monthly- rental is slightly over $45,000. In addition
to the 704, there will be lo auxiliary punched card machines including
. card punches, collators, sorters, reproducers, interpreters, and the

Type 407 Accounting machine. The aggregate machine rental is in
excess of $ 50,000 per month.

Tue Type 704 ED!!! unit is one of the fastest large-scale
comercial computers available today. Since the ILIJI'. installation
will be but one of many in the field, techniques, programs, and
numerical procedures developed for this machine will be of universal use.
