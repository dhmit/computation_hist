Dear Dr. Weyls

In accordance with our telephone conversation last week,
I au sending you our most recent estimate of plans and costs of
operation of Whirlwind I for the next two years. This can be taken
up in two parts: the one coneerning the operation of Whirlwind I
and the support of iis necessary maintenance, programming and ade
ministrative staff (DIC project 6345); the other ccmecerning the
general research and training program designed to extend the use
of digital computers in scientific and engineering researsh at the
Institute (DIC project 6915).

Project 6915 - Taking up the second part first; the goal
set up in our proposals to OR, to make faeulty and students
aware of the usefulness of high-speed digital computers by investi-
gating applications in many fields, is well on its way to attain-
ment, Graduate students and faculty supervisors in most departments
of the Institute {Biology being the major exception) have investi-
gated applications of machine methods to problems in thelr own
fields and are in the progsss of obtaining results worthy of pub-
lication in their own field's journals. This part of the program
was originglly set up for a yearly budget of £100,000, but the
rate was reduced to 80,000, at the request of ONR, before the
project had reached 1%s originally planned full strength. It is
now estimated that about F70,000 will remain in the budget of this
project by June 30, 19553 consequently, it will be able to continue,
at about ite present level of activity, for only one further year,
unless further funds are provided.

But it is quite possible that most of the aims of sush
a general research program will have been attained by June 1956

«orthuhile parts then active should each be supported,
projects, by funds from various sources. Now that the
ities of machine use are known by faculty and students,
«er support of research using machines can perhaps be provided
. the strength of the importance of the research itself, rather
than because of its interest as a problem in machine coding. Some
of these research projects may be supported by industry, some may
still need support from ONR, but the support need not all come from
‘the Mathematles Division of ONR; the other divisions, interested
in the research, should contribute their share. Consequently, no
additional funds will be requested for DIC 6915 at this time. Next
summer the situation will be re-assessed and a final decision as to
its future will then be made,

Project 6 - The situation with respect to DIC 6345,
the operation © wind I itself, is quite otherwise. This
equipment is the only high-speed digital computer available at
present for general research at the Institute. Unless enough
funds are available to pay for maintenance, operation; programming
and scheduling, no research requiring mashine computation of this
sort will be possible at the Institute and the goal set by the
other part, project 6915, would be nullified. At present WW1l is
supported in part by Lincoln Laboratory and in part by ONR. The
time not used by Lincoln, which is used by workers in projest 6345
and in the general research and ecducationsl activities of the Ine
stitute, 1s equivalent to about 40 hours & week, full one-shift
operation of the machine. The ¢os®@ not born by Lincoln hve bsen
trimmed to about $160,000 per year. The problem 48 how to provide
this amount during June 1955-June 1956 and how to provide the
i to keep going later if Lincoln should withdraw its
Suppoerv. :

One poseibility would be to charge each user proportionally. .
te his use of the washine, irrespective of the nature of his work. :
This, of course, would have thegrsesult of disceuraging most thesis
research and general faculty use of the machine, thus nullifying

the results of the efforts of project 0915, which was set up, in

part, to stimulate this interest. Another possibility would be

to charge those users who sould afford it (the sponsored projects)
enough to pay for the full F160,000 needed for the next fiscal

year and to allow thesis and general educational research free time.

a , Costs to other ONR Projects - But this year somewhat more
than one half of the sponsore >, noneLincoln) work done on WW
was done for various ONR projects carried on at the Inetitute.
Quite a bit (3-5 hours a week) was done for the project on Solid
State Physies under Professor Slater much time is used by the

Jory and 80 on. Therefore, if ONR decided not to
ct 6545, directly, it would have to add about $100,000
she budgets of several other of its projects at if
«4 them to continue at their present rate; for each of these
ots, now getting free time on WW1l, would have to contribute
_ir share divectly or not have the use of WWl. But such com-
pletely piecemeal support is not healthy for continuous operation
of a facility like WWl. The staff is at the wersy of chance
fluctuations of demarss and comsequently is often tempted to take
on purely commercial computing tasks, for outside firms, to tide
over a slask period.

S sted Svlution for 1 19856 - The better solution
would be For NR to Take 168 cont® on in a single sum, so that
the various ONR projrete at MIT need not pay extra for WW1l time,
and then to sherge he non-0NR, non-Lincoln, sponsored projects
enough for their ure of the facilities and staff so that Whirlwind
can afford to deveie some of its time to general educational re-
search without chirge. Such a system of charging has already been
worked out and h:3 been gone over with the ONR fiscal officers
the charges are $250 per hour for machine time plus extra charges
for extra time of the programming staff and for extra use of output
equipment. (.r present estimate of the number of non-ONR non-
Lincoln spor ored projects willing and ghle to contribute in this
way indica?:8 that we should be able to earn about $60,000 during
1955-1056. Such support would, of course, be subject to the
flustuati ns mentioned above, but these fluctuations would now be
in a mip ity fraction of the total budget rather thin in the
major pt, and hence would not be so large in magnitude. This
ameun’) represents a réduction in use of WWl by non-ONR projects,
pelcr the level of last year, because a number of these projects
‘ean: efford to pay charges of this size undar thelr present
vy.geiis. In other words, the imposition of auch charges will
grerense this type of work to about 1/3 of the total sponsored
sork (ONR plus other, not including Lincoln) done on Wil. It is
pissible thet this fraction will increase again as these other

sro jests cone to include computer charges im their future budgets,
but 35 is unlikely that much increase will come in 1955-1956.

Creve Budneh - With this plan of operation, the es-
timgted non- oin cost for 1955-1956 is, as mentioned, about
$161,000, of which about $60,000 should be made up by non-ONR,
aor~Lineoln DIC projects, leaving $100,000 to be born by ONR.
Buc 4it is now estimated that project 6345 will still have about

,ibilities after June 1956 - The longer range pros-
«ch more vague, of course. If Lincoln Laborat

op its support, it would cost about F250,000 a Sur to
4 running effectively on a one-shift, 40 hour-a-week basis.
.anterast this, the non-ONR project support might be increased
$100,000 a year. In addition, the Institute 1s endeavoring to
sbtain general support from industry, to supplement the present
ONR support and, we hops, eventually to superscde it. Perhaps by
1956 this support could amount to about 50,000, though this is
only @ hope as yet. is 5d
The most optimistic estimate would be to expect that,
though Lincoln will not (ive the support At gives now, it still
will contribute enough so that only $200,000 a year extra would /
be needed. If non-ONR projects could contribute F80,000-F100,000
and general industrial contributions of 750,000 a year could be
raised, then only $50,000 to $70,000 would be needed to carry through
oy Further extrapolation beyond this date is obviously
sible.

Recommendation - It is therefore recommended that OHR
grant an additional 420,000 to $30,000 to be used in 1955-1956
for WW1 operat badget (4.e., supplementary funds for project
DIC 6345), that $50,000 to $70,000 be tentatively allocated to
6345 for 1956-1957, that no further funds be allocated for project
6915, and that in December 1955 the situation be re-evaluated to
see what later needs will be,

If thi: can be done, it will be possible to furnieh oom
puting time free to ONR projects at the Institute, as well as to
general educaticnal research here, for another year, and there
will be no need to take on fe outside the Institute to keep
wWl running in “955-1956. (Note: Free time on ¥hairlwind is only
cranted by the Institute Interdepartmental Committees on Numerical
Enslysis and Mrchine Computation; thus, free time 1s not Just

ted for th: askinz, only worthwhile research projects are
allowed time.’

nave raised nd That you can reach 2 decision In “oe near future.
