other new directions, which involve machine use (meteorology,

nuclear reactor design and the like) should be supported by the
Center by grants

of some time only wvhile they are in the formative
stage, before they have been shown to be so obviously practical
that they can ask for financial support,for further computation,
in their own risht. By the time they have developed their pro-
grams and thelr special technigues of machine use, and are ready
to,exploit these methods by long "production runs", they should be
in a positvion to obtain financing to run these computations on

one of the several other siniler machines which are or will be

in operation in the vicinity,

Bven with this sort of limitation on the use of the Center
facilities, the demands on the Center will grow, bBut the growth,
if thus linited, will, we believe, be a manageable one, in keeping
with what could be impldmented by the cooperative effort of IBN
and MIT, A 7090 within the year would not delay most of the work
outlined above too seriousl And, as outlined below, it would
be able to handle them for several years, while plans are made
for the next step., On the other hand,’if a 7090 cannot be provided
soon, several of the projects mentioned above will have %o termine
ate or else will have to use other machines, which would inev-
itably mean the dissipation of the Center's usefulness in
coordinating this sort of research,

It is not intended that the Center should have a monopoly
of all computing around HIT; this would be uarealistic and, as
indicated above, impossible., DBut it must play an active role in
supporting and instigating research into new applications if it
is to continue to be the focus of new ideas and of exciting
activity which will attract, train and inspire the new cseneration

of machine experts. UMF)
