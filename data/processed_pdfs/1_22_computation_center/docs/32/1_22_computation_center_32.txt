Subject: A break-point Subroutine for the Operator Program

 

A Method for automatically inserting and removing
break-points in a users program should be provided by the operator
program, It is proposed that this be done by defining a SAP
pseudo-instruction called BKP, A break-point request deck would
have the form: :

BKPTSR 5238 Break; point subroutine
!
SYMBOL, BKP A,0,B Break point request
|
TRA C Starting address of users program
B, Arbitrary program containing out-

put requests and the terminating

instruction, TRA RESTOR, where

RESTOR is a symbol of defined in
\ BKPTSR

END BKPTSR

- BKP is a macro-instruction which generates the
following sequence of words during the SAP first pass:

(LOC) SXD BKPTSR + n,k
IXA xÂ» + 2,4
TTR BKPTSR + m
SYMBOL, PZE A,0,B

TTR & <4
where n and m are fixed integers.

The users program i8 begun by entering BKPTSR which
places C(A) in LOC + 5 and TTR LOC in A, and then transfers
control to C.

During operation of the users program each break
point request causes the following sequence of stops to occur:

(1) TTR LOC

(2) Save machine conditions.

(3) Restore machine conditions.

(4) TTR B

(5) TTR RESTOR

(6) Restore machine conditions

(7) Execute C(A)

- Special entry points are provided in BKPTSR so that

break-points way be inserted or removed by The sequences

CLA SYMBOL - CIA SYMBOL

TSX INSERT, 4% TSX REMOVE, 4

in the users program. An interlock will be provided (register
LOC + 3 being either PZE or MZE) to prevent the user from
removing a break=point already removed or inserting a break-
point already inserted.

It is also proposed that special entry points be
provided in BKPTSR for saving and restoring the machine
conditions,
