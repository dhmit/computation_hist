depending on the eouewhnt-uncertein requirenente of the Ink. universities.

I would very much appreciate it it's-yon would ilnedintely order
20 reel: of tepe (2400 foot length) for use in the 1LT. Computation Center.
'e heve diecueeed the choice of reel length and feel that we should use
1200 or 2400 feet, preferably the letter.

I would appreciate any attempt you may be able to make to
expedite the delivery of the eboveancntioned 20 reels of tape in order
thet we may begin to test out some of our programs and prepare libraries
of eubroutinel which are currently being punched on 13! cards.
