It was found that all of the positive WOTGS
can be used to describe a company fall into a

certain number of distinct synonym groups. The
most representative word of each group was then
chosen and tested experimentally. This study re-
sulted in the “trait” words which best represent
each of the basic “traits” or dimensions of a

company’s reputation.

How the Company Image Profile evaluates a
company’s personality on each of its basic traits

Each trait word, along with a definition of how
the word applies to a company, is put on a Rem-
ington-Rand tab card. The cards are then brought
to a carefully selected cross-section of the public
by specially trained interviewers. They ask each
person to sort the deck according to how well
the cards describe their opinion of the company.
The same people also sort the cards according
to how well they describe a major competitor.
This provides a benchmark so that the client will
be able to evaluate the relative merit of his own
company’s score on each trait.

the “ideal image.” Thus, the Company Image
Profile provides three valuable comparative scores
for each personality trait: the score for the client
company, the score for a competitor, and the
score for the ideal company in his line of business.

How Univac pin-points who said what about
the company

A comparison of these three company images
(the client company, a competitor, and the ideal
company) shows by sharp contrast which are the
strong points and which are the weak points of
the company’s personality. The traits are then
carefully analyzed with the help of Univac to
find out what type of people (age, sex, socio-
economic group, location, etc.) have a favorable
or unfavorable opinion of the company on each
of the personality traits.

The client company then knows, (a) exactly
what personality traits it is weak in, (b) how
serious this weakness is, and (c) the kind of
people who have a favorable or adverse opinion
of each trait in the company image.
