direction or investigation is in the application of machine tech-

0. Perhaps the most promising line of advance, in part
because the least investigated up till now, is in the field or
social science experiments, where the computer can be used as

plicated rules, which can be played by groups of investigators, to
see what the consequences are of various strategies. If the "games"
are to correspond, even distantly, to some actual social situation,
the rules must be quite complicated and the scoring will require a
great deal of statistical computation. It has been found that only
by the use of computing machines can the scoring be speeded up
sufficiently so that enough games can be run through to provide

an over-all grasp of the situation under study. Such "gaming

in social science outlined above, we will need another, more spe-
