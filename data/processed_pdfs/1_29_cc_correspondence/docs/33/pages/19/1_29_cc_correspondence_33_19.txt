G. The Replacement of 704 Copy Loops by 709 Commands

The conversion of simple wrlting loops is shown in

the following example.

IXA CNTR,1 LXA CNTR,1

WTB 1 SHD o : . IOA, 1

CPY A+N,1l WIBRE. 4

MK end .ot RCHX IOA

I0D (TGO " %) This instruction delays

the main, program until
data command is finished.
: " It should be used 1if
CNTR PZE N CNTR PZE N further computations
JOA IOCD A,,x% involve A.

The reading of a full record in a simple loop may

be converted as in the followling example.

IXA Q0,1
RTB 1 RTBX i
CEY =B RCH®, 10B
TXI ¥<1,1 =1 (TCoRc ) Wait for all information
TRA EOF 3 . to reach core
IOD EOR .
I0B TORP B, -1
I0CD O, ,0 Disconnect channel
Q0 PZE O

: it s Note: To read. N words. of & record
¢f N or -more. words, the above
program changes only at I1I0B,
which becomes

IOB IORP B,,N
