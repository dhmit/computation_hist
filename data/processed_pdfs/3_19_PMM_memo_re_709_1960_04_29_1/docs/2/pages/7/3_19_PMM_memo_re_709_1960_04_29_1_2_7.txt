a. Systems

Taking these in order, let us first consider some of
the ramifications on the basic computer system. If many peoplk
are to be glven a real time access to a computer, the computer
must be capable of being time shared among remote user "consoles‚Äù
or sub-stations. It must equably divide up its time among the
users, and be able to quickly shift from one problem to the net,
so that each user is in effect using a slower machine, but one
which 1s not blocked off by other users. These remote units
must be connected to the maln computer over low cost communi-
cation links.

To save time, programs must be allowed to coexist
within the same machine without mutual interference, and pro-
grams must be readily accessable via a large backup memory so
that any user can work in any available computer language of
his choice.

Our plans are to adapt an existing computer system
for time sharing. The implications of this set of require-
ments on the system are the following. Filrst, in order to al-
low running programs to coexlst, changes wlll have to be made
in intfernal logical design to provide barriers in memory to
prevent unwanted access or change. Second, an "exchange" buf-
fer will have to be developed to service from 15-30 remote
stations, and provide for a pre-selected distribution of
available time among the remote units. A large memory such
as disc files will also have to be linked into the system.

b. Peripheral Equipment

At present, it is envisioned that there will be two
basic types of remote consoles and connecting lines required.
These are: 1) A set of specially modified electric typewriters
and low-data-rate connections to the main computer for most re-
mote console stations. Thus, for these statlons, the electric
typewriter would be the only communication to the computer.
