Dear Peyson:

In accordance with your recent request for information concerning
the office equipment requirements for the MIT Computation Center, I have
prepared a memorandum CC-10 which itemizes the equipment needs in the Center,

I have not included a detailed breakdown of the equipment require-
ments for the following areas:

item 8 ~ Customer Engineering, Room 160
Item 8 - 704 Calculator Room, Room 156
Item 15 - EAM Area, Room 058

because Mr Malcolm Beers of the Wright Line has prepared a separate proposal
dated January 23 which has been sent directly to you via Dr, Truman Hunter,

I believe the combination of the memo and Mr, Beer's proposal will
contain the information you require, You will notice that I left the unit
price and total price columns blank in order that you may fill in these figures
using appropriate vendor costs, After you have had an opportunity to study
this, I would appreciate hearing from you in order that we may synchronize our
purchases based on a decision regarding our respective commitments,

Sincerely yours,

F, HB, Verzuh
, Essistant Director
FMV :nb Sf MIT Computation Center
