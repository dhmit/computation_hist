Dear Dr. Morse,

Just a note to thank you very much for all your
kindness to my colleagues and me last Tuesday. We were
much impressed with the great progress the Computation
Center has made not only at M, I, T. but in the participating
colleges in New England, and I wanted to express through
this letter the extreme satisfaction of the Company in this
progress. Please extend to your associates our thanks for
making such an auspicious start.

Looking forward to seeing you again soon,

Sincerely yours,

e

Dr. Phillip M. Morse
