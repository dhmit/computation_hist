The deck of request cards to be processed is placed in the on-
line card reader and is read in by the post-mortem program,

Three additional magnetic tape units may be required
by the program:

(1) MT2 is required if results for off-line printing
are produced,

(2) MT3 is required if results for off=1ine punching
are produced.

(3) MuTS is always required for temporary storage.

The post-mortem program does not rewind T2 or MT3 so
