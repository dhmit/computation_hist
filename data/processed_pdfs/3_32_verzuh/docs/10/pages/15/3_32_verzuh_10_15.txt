EXPENSES INCURRED IN THE REMOVAL OF THE RDA

Table IIl contains a detailed breakdown of the number of working hours,
hourly rates, etc. for the personnel as well as other expenses which have been
incurred on the RDA under Account No. 1979.41. When one considers some of the
original estimates which were made concerning the cost of the removal of the
RDA, the smount $2638.59 is indeed a relatively smell sum.

It msust be understood that cperations of this type naturally require
considerable time of certain administrative personnel which, of course, do not
directly appear as expense items in the above Table IXII. Thus, the above-
mentioned cost of RDA removal is slightly misleading.
