Tug DOUBLE LAYER ErLecrroLYTIC TANK

The double layer electrolytic tank recently de-
veloped by Boothroyd et al? has two advantages
over the conventional type in the technic of field
plotting: first, the boundary error is eliminated and
the measurements are equivalent to those made in
an infinite two-dimensional medium; and secondly,
it is possible to obtain a theoretically perfect “in-
different” electrode. In this tank, the electrolyte is
‘ded into two layers by a 1714 inch diameter
ass disk mounted on four small spacers. As
the diameter of the tank itself is 18 inches, there is a

he edge of the plate. The top

14 inch gap around t
liquid layer is thus contiguous with the lower layer

around the periphery, and the two layers are elec-
trically “matched”. Mathematically? the top layer
behaves as part of an infinite sheet; physically, the
currents. instead of being ref racted at the edge, flow
around the edge and continue their course in the
bottom layer.
In the tank as originally used for solving network
urrent electrode was situated at the
center of the bottom layer, and was used as the
ground return point. This was removed, and a
platinum ungrounded electrode substituted as the
reference point. That the bottom layer electrode Is
at zero potential was proved by a simple experiment,
shown in figure 1. Two dipoles were placed at ran-
dom locations, A and B, in the double-layer tank.
The point P is then a theoretical sero-potential
point, since it lies at the intersection of the trans-
verse axes of the two dipoles. When potentials were
measured with respect to the bhottom-layer electrode,
P was found to have zero potential. :
The double-layer tank is very useful for measuring
the field due to any distribution of sources and sinks,
as it is not necessary to correct for the finite hound-
ary. In addition, the locus of the sero-potential line
due to the distribution can be determined.

The potential of a dipole in an infinite two-
dimensional medium: This problem was prob-
ably first worked out by Kirchoff in 1845,* and
a complete treatment was given by Foster and
Lodge in 1875.° With reference to electro-
cardiography, Wilson presented calculations of
potentials of a dipole in an infinite medium and

is evident that the double-layer tank gives g

axis (dipole axis from — to + pole); M =
M /2xkd. Equation (2) is more convenient and
accurate than equation (1) at remote points,
since equation (1) would involve the measure-
ment of two nearly equal distances. The locus
of the zero-potential line can be found from
equation (2) by setting V = 0. This will be
true when 8 = 90° or 270°, or along the line
perpendicular to the dipole axis.

same Size and shape and a potential difference
of 2 volts were set up between them (assuming
no polarization troubles), the external field
would be absolutely unchanged. It is, there-
fore, possible to use metal conductors in field
studies, as long as the conductors represent
equipotential lines or areas of the original field.
The field in the region inside the metal con-
ductors in figure 4 would be different from that
of a similar region in figure 3, as in the former
case the equipotentials tend to be tangent to
the conductors. The zero line 1s similar in the
two cases, however. The bending of the external
zero line in figure 4 1s due to the slight asym-
metry of the two groups of conductors. The fact
that the field at points away from the half-
shells is very similar to the field produced by a
point source and sink is in keeping with the
demonstration’ that any distribution of sources
and sinks has a statistical average, which is
equivalent to a single source and sink. (This is
not meant to imply that the potential distri-
bution near the heart is necessarily equivalent
to that produced by a single dipole.)

SOLUTION OF BOUNDARY ProBrLeEMS BY IMAGES

The simplest method of treating boundary
value problems is by the use of images, 1n-
troduced by Thomson (Lord Kelvin)? If
a source and sink in the presence of a boundary
produce a certain potential field, the image system
18 the hypothetical distribution of sources and
sinks which would produce the same field with
the boundary removed. Tt is then possible to
apply equation (1) to each set of sources and
sinks, original and image, to find the potential.

I'he term “Image” as used here and dis-
cussed by Pruitt and Valencia® involves an
entirely different concept from the ‘image

As the boundary in the single-layer tank is

the lines of current flow must be tangential to

visualize the resulting potential and current

posed to find the resulting field.
