IMPORTANT
PROPERTY NUMBERING - PROJECTS IN THE 7,000's

Beginning with DIC Project Number 7,000, equipment
will have to carry the full DIC project number, followed
by the usual individurl number series.

For example, the first two items ef equipment acquired
on project number 7,125 will be numbered 7125-1 and 7125-2.

This 1s necegsary because otherwise we could not dis-

tinguish equivment in the 7,000 series from the 6,000 series.
