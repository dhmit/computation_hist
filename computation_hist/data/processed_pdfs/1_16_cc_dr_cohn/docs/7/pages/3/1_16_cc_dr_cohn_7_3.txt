indicate a basis for liaison between

2- plane stein series E4(z) can be deﬁned through

with a perturbation boundary (the in-

dividual term of the Eisenstein series being regarded as the contribu-
tion of a speciﬁc “perturbation circle”). Although the modular—
function methods are quite classical, critical use is made of the more

current idea of variation of the boundary.1

2. The perturbation map. We consider the perturbation caused
to the fundamental domain :00 by removing the portion above the line
Imz = Us (5 < 1). The remaining (ﬁnite) portion, 3L , is mapped
by the modular group 2 —» 2T (of equation (1)) onto a portion of the
upper half z-plane, 1L , which is constructed by removing from the
upper half z-plane the interior of a circle called C,/q(e), tangent to the
real axis at p/q (*1/0) and of diameter e/qz. (For consistency, “the
interior of Cook)” denotes the region Im z > l/e). Thus 11. is
a simply connected region of the z»plane, invariant under the modular
group. (See Fig. 1.)

We now deﬁne f = {.(z) to be the mapping of H. onto the upper

The existence of such a limit is suggested by the next section, which
indicates the connection with the Eisenstein series. The proof of its
existence requires the major portion of this paper.

3, Approximation by superposition. The series expansion P(z)
is derived ﬁrst from the assumption that each perturbing circle is
approximately independent of the others. For instance, if just
(the interior of) one circle Cp,,(e) were deleted from the upper half
zeplane, the corresponding mapping function (JP/“(2) (with ﬁxed
direction element at i) would easily be given by

The terms in 22 are the “perturbation terms,” which (see equation

or, reducing the general term, we should ﬁnd

Rather than justify the approximation directly (even on the
assumption that the limit (6) exists), we shall give what we hope is a
more revealing veriﬁcation by deeper methods, more characteristic of
the theory of modular functions. In the meantime we observe, term
