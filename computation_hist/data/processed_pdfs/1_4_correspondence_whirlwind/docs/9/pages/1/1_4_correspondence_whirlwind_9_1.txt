Dear Dr. Weyl:

In accordance with our telephone conversation last week,
I on sending you cur most recent estimate of plans and costs of
operation of Whirlwind I for the next two years. This can be taken
up in two parts: the one concerning the operation of Whirlwind I
and the support of its necessary maintenance, programing and ed-
miniatrative staff (DIG project 6315); the other concerning the
general research and training program designed to extend the use
of digital computers in scientific and engineering research at the
Institute (DIG project 6915).

Project 6 l - Taking up the second part first; the goal
set up in our s proposals to mm, to make faculty and students
aware of the usefulness of high-speed digital computers by investi-
gating applications in many fields, is well on its way to attain-
ment. Graduate students and faculty supervisors in most departments
or the Institute . (Biology being the major exception) have investi-
gated applications of machine methods to problems in their own
fields and are in the process of obtaining results worthy of pub-
lication in their own field 's Journals. This art of the program
was originally set up for a yearly budget of 100,000, but the

rate was reduced to $80,000, at the request of one, before the
proJeet had reached its originally planned full strength. It is
now estimated that about $70,000 will remain in the budget of this
project by June 30, 1955; consequently, it will be able to continue,
at about its present level of activity, for only one further year,
unless further funds are provided.

But it is quite possible that most of the aims of such
a general research prawn will have been attained by June 1956
