For those user'!'s who may need to know operating
procedures the console restart procedure, making a
manual entry to F2PM 1s:

Scope Programs

The cathode ray tube on the 7090 will be connected
to channel A and will be controlled through channel
commands. Present scope programs using "copy logic"
must be converted. The Center 1is converting those
routines which are on the library tape.

Off-1line Tape Processing

It is expected that our 1401's will exactly
gsimulate our present off-line tape processing
equipment except that:

e printing will be done with program
controlled carriage spacing,

2. All card-reading will insert the Mook-
ahead bits" in the tape record,

3., Space-suppress may be different.

At the moment, we would suggest no changes to
your programs unless you do not print under program
control.

Tape Assignments

The following is the anticipated FMS tape
assignment. The anly changes are the reassignment
of the library tape and the addition of tapes 1l
and 12 to the system.
