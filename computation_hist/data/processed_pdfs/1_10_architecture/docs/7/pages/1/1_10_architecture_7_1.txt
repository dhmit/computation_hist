Dear Professor Morse:

We have discussed with Mr. Gusick the temporary
space situation for IBM. We have arranged to assign the
one bay ZOE-226 to IBM temporarily for the period
October 31, 1956 - April 1, 1957 inclusive. On April 2, 1957
the Technique will again need this room.

It should be clearly understood that the adjoining
classroom, 206-228, cannot be released to IBM as this room
will be needed for classes all year.

Very truly yours ,

W
