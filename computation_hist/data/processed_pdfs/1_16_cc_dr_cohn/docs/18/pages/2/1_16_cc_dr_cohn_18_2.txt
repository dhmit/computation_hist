Iglograms, Minkowski ﬁrst conjectured, in effect, that the minimum and num-
mum areas would occur at the symmetric posmons, i.e., when the parallelogram
has a vertex on the E - (or n -) axis or on the hue 5.: 7/ (or E = — n). We
shall prove tbjs conjecture to be false, (see 4), for certain small ranges of p and
to be true, (see 5), for suﬂiciently large values of p. MlnkOWSkl went on to make
the second conjecture that the minimum parallelogram will have a vertex on the
lineE = 1; (m5 = — 1]) when p > 2, while it will have a vertex on the E—(or
11 -) axis whenZ > p > 1. MordeH [3] veriﬁed both these conjectures in the case
p = 4, while Davis [1] disproved the second conjecture for values of p sufﬁ-
ciently close to 1 and 2.

We shall also consider the question of when the symmetric parallelogram
provide relative maxima and minima, since this matter has bearing on the con-
jectures when p is not large, and, in particular, it provides our proof that the
optima (and the critical lattices associated with them) do not necessarily pm-
take 0f the ObVlOUS symmetries of the metric. This, of course, contradicts Min-
kowski’s ﬁrst conjecture. Our main result, however, is a proof of Minkowski’s
ﬁrst and second conjectures when p is sufﬁciently large.’

2. Formulation of the problem

We describe the family 0i inscribed parallelograms as follows: We use the
symmetries of the problem so that the parallelogram will have vertices (El, 171)

Then differentiating, we ﬁnd that, ex

Thus, in principle, all of Minkowski’s conjectures can be resolved by solving

equations (2) and (3) Simultaneously for u and ‘r as functions of p. We shall
ultimately do this, but only for p sufficiently large.

In the meantime, we take note of the two
7=0,o' = apandr = 79,17 =1,where

(4) a, = (2" — 1)”
72 + 1 = 2(1 — To".

We ﬁrst verify that if the base of the parallelogram is rotated from one of these
positions to the other, then each position, within symmetries, uill be assumed by
one of the three vertices lying on the curve I i l” + l 1] l" = 1. In fact, the base clearly
takes all slopes between 0 and 1,, , the opposite vertex takes all slopes between
— c1, and - 1 while the included vertex takes all'slopes between up and 1/7,. 3
By symmetry, these slopes cover all values between 0 and 1. Hence it is no
fundamental restriction to conﬁne a to the interval V, g a i 1, (01' 10 make the
Corresponding restriction 0 g ‘r g 1,, . As for thc size of these intervals, when p
goes from 1 to w, (7,, goes from 1 to 2, while 7 goes from % to 0, At the same
time, from simple convexity properties, A,,(o, 7) increases monotonically in p for
ﬁXcdo and 1 with A1(r, a) E %, A20? (7)5 g 3, and Aw(.-, a) E 1, for all a and 1.

3. Relative sizes of symmetry parallelograms

If we substitute 1' = 0 and -r = 7-1,, we obtain the following areas correspond-
ing to Parallelograms whose base is a line of symmetry of the curve
