Room 3-240, Me 1.7.

Dear Carl:

The more I see of 701 and 70% installations, the more
I'm convinced that quieting the air conditioning 1s not a minor
problem but a really serious one, that it will require careful
treating of the ducts and probably also the individual machines
if the words "demonstration area‚Äù and "instructional purposes"
are to be other than a mockery. I also hear that the architects
have not yet consulted with Bolt, Beranek and Newman about this
problem, in spite of the fact that Peterson suggested this two
wonths age.

If the main computer roow ends up like the ones I've
seen, with poorly designed duct-work and no treatment around the
units giving rise to 70-90 db background, I'm golng to refuse to
accept the installation until it is fixed--and fixing badly designed
ducts ig always expensive!

Can you see whether B, B and N can be called in before
it is too late?

Tours,
