The idea of a programmer today differs considerably from what it was 60 years ago, in the time of the IBM 704. Instead of your typical college-educated, introverted programmer, the MIT Computation Center sought a different type of demographic.

    <p>Working as a programmer in the 1950s at MIT was surprisingly different from the programming jobs seen today. Instead of the graduate degrees, years of experience needed, and ability to work independently on complex projects, qualifications to become an IBM 704 “Electronic Data Processing Machine Programmer” included a high school education, scoring well on an aptitude test, and the ability to work well with others. While a college education, especially one in mathematics, was helpful, the field of programming was so new and unfamiliar, newly-hired programmers would complete a six-week intensive training course to familiarize themselves with the logical thinking behind programming and the mechanical components of the IBM 704 itself. Using an aptitude test may seem strange as a qualification for a highly technical job, but the profession of programmers was emerging, and no other feasible qualifications existed. The idea was that if prospective programmers had aptitudes and personalities similar to current programmers they would then fit the job similarly well.</p>

    <p>	While there is a conception today of programmers as antisocial and able to work most effectively by themselves, such a person would have been useless on an IBM 704 computer. Running a program on this early machine required manual manipulation of card punchers, card readers, magnetic drum units, wired control panels, and many other advanced components that would have been impossible to handle alone. A team of people, each with a specialized job, collectively ran the IBM 704 and it was imperative that the programmer worked well in group situations to communicate effectively what needed to be computed.</p>

    <p>	There also existed multiple types of programmers, each with varied experience and proficiency in programming. At the base level were “trainee programmers” or “coders” in the process of becoming proficient in programing: they were tasked with writing machine instructions based on ideas from more senior programmers. Above coders were regular “programmers” who represented a program's underlying logic through block diagrams and flowcharts that would be later written into code by the coders. The most senior programmers were referred to as “professional programmers”: they held the same responsibilities as regular programmers but were tasked with programing the most complex problems and had the highest levels of experience and competency. The ultimate goal of a programmer was to obtain a high level of accuracy. In a memo from Dr. Verzuh about qualifications for a 704 programmer, it was written that “2 top-notch programmers recently prepared a program of 6,000 instructions in 34 hours―-containing only 1 error! Accuracy is most important!”</p>
