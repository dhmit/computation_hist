7.0 INSTITUTE SPACE REALLOCATION

The removal of the RDA will naturally serve to release a number of bays
of space in Building 7. S8Specifically, 2450 sq. ft. of space have been released
as & result of the removal of the RDA. The following bronkdovn indicates the
space involved:

Bay Area (sq. ft.)
7-302 (2) 700
7-303 (4) 1400
3-329 (1) 350
2450

As a matter of fact, the machine shop which formally occupied the two bays

in 7-302 has alresady been transferred to Room 10-481 and the two bays in
7-302 are currently occupied by the Educational Coumcil.

The remaining 5 bays of space (1750 sq. ft.) are to be occupied by the
Architecture Department. The receipt of this 2500 sg. ft. of space should

~certainly help to alleviate thqir space requirements.

CONCLUSION

Thii memorandum contains some o0f the facts associated with the removal of
the RDA. A brief description of the historical background of the machine, a

survey of its applications, and disposition of various components are described
in considerable detail.

A breakdown of the expenses incurred in this operation isgivem, and it
is of interest to note that only $2638.59 was required to remove this "200-ton
gisnt‚Äù from the M.I.T. premises. Perhaps of equal interest is the fact that it
only required 60-man days (over a 2-week period) to accomplish this removal.

It is hoped that this report contains sufficient information to properly
ecknowledge the financial assigance received from the Rockfeller Research
Foundation. Furthermore, it should serve 28 a record of the disposition of the
equipment contained on the machine. In this regard, it is perhaps well to men-
tion that an entire power plant facilities, motably, power transformers, a motor
generator set, an air compressor, a precipitron unit etc., have been given to
Buildings and Power for other l I.T. use.

in cloaing. it is evident that the RDA has served & very useful purpose
in the Institute. However, like all things, it had a limited 1life and certainly
had become obsolete by existing astandards of the large-scale computing equipment.
It is therefore only proper that it should be removed and that other modern
computing eguipment be installed to serve in its place.
