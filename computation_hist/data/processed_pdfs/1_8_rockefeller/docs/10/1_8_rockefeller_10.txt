Dear Chancellor Suntan; A

I have the honor to Mom you that at a meeting or the
Board of Trustees of The Rockefeller Foundation on Decanter h and 5,
1956, action was taken providing up to $98,100 to the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology for use under the direction of Professor
Philip M. Morse, toward the costs of exploring the potential uses
of high-speed computing equipment in the solution of theoretical
and applied problems in the social sciences. This sun is {or use
during the three-year period beginning July 1, 1957.

It is understood that if at any time Professor Horse ceases
to be in active direction of this research, there shall be no commit-
ment on the part of the Foundation for more than one year thereafter
and the situation will be reviewed by the Institute and the Founda:
tion.

If it nests with your convenience, we shall be glad to
make payments on this grant on a semi-annual basis upon receipt at
the beginning of each year of a budget for the program. We shall
appreciate receiving also annual statements of receipts and expendi—

tures. Any balance of the fund unexpended on June 30, 1960, will

revert to the Foundation.

A brief public enhancement of this grant will be made in
the next quarterly report of the Fomdatlm. There is, however, no
objection on our part to your announcement of the grant prior to the
issuance of the Foundation's report it for any reason this appears
to you desirable. In this oomeotlm I am enclosing, as a matter of
routine, a printed statement of The Rockefeller Foundation policy
regarding the annmmoement of grants.

It is a pleasure to report this aotion to you.

Sincerely yours,

FLORA M. RHINO
