Dear Mr. Aucoin:

Many thanks for your letter of Mareh 16th telling me of the
availability of your IBM 704 computer on a rental basis.

In discussing this matier with some of my colleagues 1n the School
of Engineering, I learned that from time to time our gtaff takes advan-
tage of the opportunity you have outlined. The difficully comes in
connection with the student need for computer time because these are
the people who ordinarily are without financial support. It is hard
to find a way to help these vorthy users within the 1imits of M.I.T.'s
financial ability to pay-

Sincerely yours,

Gordon S. Brown, Dean
3chool of Engineering
