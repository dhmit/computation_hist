which enables the 704 to be used on languaze translation problems;
and LISP, which enables the machine to handle non-compubetienst
logic, such as algebralc and other symbolic manipulation, are
being developed and tested. The work at LIT in ¥his field, since
tnirlwind days, is well known.

Time-sharing Technigues: ve already have a typewriter connected
to the 704, vhich works on a time-sharing basis with our regular
operator routine, So new programs can be debugged 2t the same uvime
that regular computatioms are being carried out on other problenms,
for example. ''he 704 cannot effectively accomodate more than one |
or two such sa telite chennels, but the Center stafl is now at work l A
on ’C!Sl_% design and programning required to provide a 7090 with /O éétéo
to 32 such "substation consoles" of various effective speeds and
capacities, which can be placed at appropriate places around nIT,
some perhaps in class rooms. Ce~JLﬂ_ |
