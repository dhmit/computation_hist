Dear Frank:

In accordance with you: letter dated January 14, 1957. we have
ordered the following three items:

1. 50, 000 white Share symbolic cards form #884391.
black ink, left hand corner cut

2. From Moore Business Forms - 5, 000 sets Form #1013-
2 part

3. From Moore Business Forms - Z. 500 sets Form #1013-
3 part

The items coming from Moore Business Forms will be sent to

your office but with my name. Of course, you do not have to wait for me
to open the packages.

 

We did not order items two and three on your letter since they

deal with the 650 and do not come under our contract for furnishing supplies
to the 704.

Sincerely yours,
