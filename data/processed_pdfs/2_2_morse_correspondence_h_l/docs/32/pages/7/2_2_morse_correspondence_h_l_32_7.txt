transmission of the polarized components vary appreciably with
the angle of incidence, the total fractions of radiation reflected and
transmitted by the system are almost constant for angles of inci-
dence between 0° and 30°.

(Hadley and Dennison give one set of equations for the perpen-
dicular component, and indicate how these equations should be
modified to be applicable to the parallel component. This modifica-
tion results in a change of order of magnitude which may resultin a
loss of accuracy if an insufficient number of significant figures is
carried through in the computation.)

APPENDIX II. WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION
FOR THE PHASE ANGLE OF THE BACKING

Equation (6) gives a general expression for the weights to be
given to each value of the phase angle 6. In the main body of this
paper the expression given by Eq. (8) has been used for f(6). In
this appendix Eq. (6) is used to derive f(6) as follows:

If the source consists of a finite band of wavelengths, the in-
tensity of each wavelength within this band being the same,

o(\)=1/v when A—v/2<A<A+/2
¢(\)=0 elsewhere.

If the backing is a wedge with plane surfaces and a small wedge
angle, the field of view rectangular, with sides parallel and perpen-
dicular to the edge of the wedge:

Y(b)=1/¢ when b—¢/2<b<b+¢/2
() =0 elsewhere.

f(6)=0 in the interval 6,<8,

When 6 is large (for instance, when A~6000A, b~2X 10°A) and o
and v are small (for instance, y~100A; ¢~10!— 10°A), f(0) is

closely approximated by a-trapezoid as drawn in Fig. 6 of which
the dimensions are as follows:

Width of each slanted portion= 8{= DxmiyyD/A when v /N<i/b.

In general, then, the width of the trapezoid measured at half-
height is proportional to the width of the wider of the two distri-
bution functions ¢ and ¢, the width of the slanted portions
proportional to the width of the narrower one.

When /A= /b, the center section of the trapezoid disappears,
so that the graph of f(6) becomes a triangle.

When the source is monochromatic, 4=0; when the backing has
plane-parallel surfaces, {=0. In either case §,—8, becomes zero,
and 63— 6, becomes zero, so that the trapezoid becomes a rectangle.
When both =0 and ¢=0, f(6)=68(0—0b/\), where (x—2z) is
defined as follows:

7 sa—z)dr=1.

Substituting Eq. (38) into Eq. (9) gives the average values of R
and T for each case, which correspond to the measured quantities.
When both =0 and ¢=0,

R= j: R(0)8(0—b/N)do=R(b/N); T=T(B/N).

This corresponds to Eqs. (25) and (26) for the case of mono-
chromatic radiation and uniform backings, with =5, and A= \.
In the main part of the paper Eq. (8) has been used as an ap-
proximation to f(8). It is seen now that this corresponds to either
¥=0 or ¢=0. It was already shown that when e=nr substitution
into Eq. (9) yields a result identical with that obtained by in-
tensity addition. It remains now to estimate the deviation from
this result when e, and when the sides are slanted. Since the
relative influence of the uncovered face of the backing is greatest
when the second face is also uncovered, the simpler examples of
plain backings without metal films are considered here.
Substituting the trapezoidal approximations to Eq. (38) into
Eq. (9) and taking for R and T the expressions given by Egs. (16)
and (17) respectively, integration produces the following result:

R=Ri+A(¢, 8); T=Ti—A(e o),

where R; and Ty are the results of intensity addition, and A is an
oscillating function in e and 8, which has maximum values given in
Eqs. (40) and (41):

When 6>0, the deviation is less than Am.’. Table III demon-
strates that amplitudeladdition is necessary for monochromatic
radiation incident on a uniform, flat backing, but when the inci-
dent radiation extends over a band width of 100A, intensity
addition is sufficiently accurate even for the uniform flat backing.
When the backing has a thickness range of 2)X 10~ cm (1 percent),
and monochromatic radiation is used, intensity addition may or
may not be justified, depending on the a.ccuracy desired. For a
finite band width and a nonuniform back'ng, intensity addition
gives exceedingly good agreement with the rigorous amplitude
treatment. Even better agreement is obtained for thicker backings
and the same range in wavelengths and thicknesses.
