Deay Dy, Shader:

We were very pleased to have a chance to report to Mr. Watson
and the others of your party ot our progross. The suggestions you
made will be of value to us and Mr. Watson's indication of his
continued support is encouraging.

A8 we polnted out then, we find, from time to tinme, that we
need suxiliary equipment, or small modifications of the 704 itself,
in order to make the machine more useful to ite users., Ume example
of this, sentioned briefly at the meeting, is the addition of the
so-called Real Timo Package for the 704 main frame, This addition
would enable several Â£.E. students to use the 704 for their Ph.D.
thesis work in communications, which otherwise would have to be
done on some cutside machine, or not done at all, There are
indications that, once installed, it would be continually useful .

in ceses like this, I feel it only appropriate that the
Institute contribute toward the additional cost of these wmodificen-
tions, that IBM not be asked to contribute move than you are already
contrinuting. But I wonder whether it is faly to ask the Institute
to pay the same price for the modification thai I8 would charge its
conmercial customers. Would it not be possible, for example, for us
t0 pay IBH the actual cost of the real time package, rather than
cost plus profii?

I would be glad to talk over this problem with you in the near
future, to see whether we can work out a mutually satisfactory
