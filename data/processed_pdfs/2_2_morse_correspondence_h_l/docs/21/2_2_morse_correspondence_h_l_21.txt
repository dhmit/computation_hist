Dear Dr, Forester:

The Louisiana State University is planning a digital computing
center, As part of our Planning program, a group of us is visiting
other institutions which now have operating centers, We would
appreciate an opportunity to visit your center and discuss with you
the problems of staff, facilities and courses,

We expect to be in Boston on Wednesday and Thursday, June 5 and 6.
Would it be convenient for you to see us the morning of the 6th?
We were tentatively planning to visit Harvard on the 5th. Our
touring committee will consist of Prof, L, V, McLean of Electrical
Engineering, Dr, B, B, Townsend of Mathematics, Dr, L, C, Megginson
of Commerce and myself, If it is not convenient for you or someone
on your staff to see us at the time indicated, I would appreciate

a note to that effect with any suggestions for an alternate time
which you might have,

Sincerely,
} Aan
