Since a I'eésearch and training program must be closely
linked f%fh¥??P§3«f339%Fy activities, it is proposed that s Hu
SuperViéiOQABe\uhdé}tékéﬁ by the recently created €enter for
Machine Computation. The interdepartmental Advisory Committee to
this Center Provides a broag representation ofﬁvarioussnientific,
engineering ang training activities likely to be involved.

The progranm which ONR might wish to Support can be divided
into four sections:

l. Research in methods of numerical analysis and the formu-
lation of Scientific problems for machine solution, together with
support of training of students in these methods.

2. Support of the scientifijc and engineering applications
ETroup previously referred to with Project Whirlwind so as to make
the WW computer useful and available for the above research, and
aid to the research being carried on by MIT faculty ang students,

3« A partial sSupport of the maintenance of the Wy computer,

4. Research on and investigation of digital computing machine

components.,

It is understood that details of the brogram, which is
necessarily evolutionary in character, will pe worked out from

time to time with the Scientific Officer of the ONR.

It is contemplated that $300,000 per annmum for & period
of at least two years will be required to get this program under

way. Detail of the budget is as follows:
