Although there is complete unanimity in universities,
supporting government agencies, computer manufacturers; and
comuerce and industry generally as to vhat university computer
activities should ideally be restricted to, there 1s absclubely
no agreement either among these groups or even within any one
of them ag to how such an ideal can be maintained, op how
mach departure from this ideal is tolerable or even feasible.
The reason for this disagreement about means in the face of
unenimous agrecuent about ends is that the three sources of
support set contradictory limits to the departure from the
ideals what is more, such contradictory limits are set sven
if we lock at e, cles alone.

It is agreed that the ideal is that computer activities
be restricted to professional education, research, and sone
development in the counuber ares, education on computers fox
the university and the community at large, and productive
application to support research around the university and
administration within the wniversity, It is agreed that the
ideal does not include productive work for the government y
commerce, and industry by university personnel, even if,
and sone say especially if, any profit can accrue.

It 19 agreed further that a number of new expenses appeny
whieh the university has never had to meet before, such as

preperation of courses, curricula, and texts in the area,
pers in the area, fellowships and scholarships

in the area, the initial capitel investment and installation,
the extra resulting overhead in space, supplies, and services,
gpart from amortization of replacement costs, and, most
gritically, the year-in year-out expenses for stalling,
operation, and maintenance of facilities. The last item alone,
for a single biz machine in around-the-clock operation is more
than a quarter of a million a year.

The university must be made capable of meeting all this
new investment, and thereby incurs the additional continuing
aduinlistrative expenses of proposal writing, contract negotiation,
eontract follow-up, termination, and possibly foreclosure. For
at this point there is again unanimous agreement that income
from tuition will not begin to ccver these expenses and that
initial costs and various blanket and individual supports

wioge losses place them in a greater competitive disadvantage

than do those of the university.

Some government agencies, on the other hand, ignore any

computer usage but thet on projects they support; on these, |


however, they feel the charges should be nominal and preferably
covered by university overhead. Somes government suwlitors even
feel that the suitable nominal charges should be restricted 4o
the total cost of the time for government supported project
usage only, and that the goverment should not contribute one
cent of profit to that time even though that profit barely
Covers the remaining cost for the ideally used free tine for
education and pesearch,

the combination of the manufocturers and government
policies thus force the university to pay partial rates for
ideally used time for which there is ne income and ful
commercial rates for ideally used time for wihleh there is a
partial income, This situation tempts the university to
engage In not so ideal 2 usage in order to get some fall
“heome for full commercial rates or the equivalent payed,

Bat as long as there is one bit of ideal usigey the wnlversity
cannot approximate breaking even, and at the same time it is
competing with Industry to whieh it keeps losing its personnel
either before they are completely educated, or before they
have educated their own successors. And through all this it
must cover the usual wdversity expenses Of senior agadenic

With such a dilemma it is not surprising that sven
universities matching on ali categories cannot agree on how to
proceed,

Nevertheless there is a certain vague supersaturated area
of agreement which I have tried to Crystallize in the form of
a set of recommendations: It is requested that the National
