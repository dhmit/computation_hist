Sciences Division)

Gmatlemen: >
Since it is the desire of the Government and the Contractor that the research
under Task Order I of Contract NSOri-GO be continued pending the availability

of funds for additional research to be conducted, it has been determined to
extend the period of performance of said Task Order.

In consideration of the foregoing, Task Order I, as amended, is hereby further
amended as follows:

1. Delete section (G) in its entirety and substitute in lieu thereof
the following:

"(G) The work to be performed under this Task Order shall commence
on 30 June 1916, and shall be completed on 30 April 1956."

2. Effective as of the date of this amendment, add the following sentence
to section (P):

"In material submitted hereunder as technical reports, there shall
be affixed to the front of the face page of each such technical report a
statement to the effect that 'reproduction in whole or in part is permitted
for any purpose of the United States Government "'

This amendment makes no change in the estimated cost of Task Order I.
