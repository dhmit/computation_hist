Professor P. M. Morse —2— April 27, 1956

I then talked to Mr. Deri about the air conditioning equip—
ment and was told it would take substantially all the basement. Also,
they could not do any more work on that until the 704 layout was com-
pleted. I do not agree with this, since the ducts can be laid anywhere
in the false floor to the machines. I felt I could not argue this over
the telephone so it was dropped.

There is to be another meeting in Mr. Peterson's office at
M I T on April 28, 1956 at which time we will try to resolve the
final decisions on the questions raised above.
Sincerely yours,
