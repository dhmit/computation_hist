14. On one or two additional sheets write sections A, B, and C as follows:

Section A: A one-paragraph abstract describing the nature of problem and listing
the particular mathematical, logical and numerical techniques used.

Section B: A description of problem background in sufficient detail so that a
person well acquainted with the relevent field of research can
understand the problem. References to related work should be given
with an indication of the relation to this problem.

Section C: A description of the particular mathematical, logical and numerical
techniques used. Describe any expected difficulties in formulation
of the problem and solution on the computer. This description should
include, when appropriate, no. of significant figures desired, ranges
and values of parameters to be tested and number of cases to be
studied in sufficient detail so that the computer time required can
be at least approximately estimated. Plans for testing the computer
program should be described.
