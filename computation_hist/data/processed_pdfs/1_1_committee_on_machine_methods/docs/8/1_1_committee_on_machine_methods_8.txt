The Committee met with Dr. Draper and his group to discuss
possible relationships, particularly concerning the differential
analyzer. First, we asked the opinion of this group concerning
possible courses in machine techniques. Draper indicated that
there might be between 15 and 30 men available each year for
training and for courses in this field. He indicated that a
basic course with prerequisite M351 and M352 would be needed,
and that, in addition, special courses on various types of
machines would be useful. This discussion will be of uelp to
the Committee in its further study of the problem.

The Committee went on to discuss the problem of the dif-
ferential analyzer. Dr. Draper's group took over the analyzer

‘ the first of July. For the first two months the machine was

down oeing overhauled. During October and November it worked
almost full time on problems for Draper's project. At present
there is available a certain amount of time for outside work,
and the project would welcome suggestions from the Committee
as to the type of work it could and should take on. It was
pointed out that for the machine to be in operating condition
requires a staff of abut Byersons -- one technician, one
machinist and three programming staff —‘ and that these people,
with their salaries and with the necessary overhead charges,
cost about $30,000 a year. However, for those times when the
machine is not in full use some of the staff can be taken over
to work on other parts of Draper‘s proJect so that in a con—
tinuing program the cost per year would be somewhat less then
the $30,000. The indications were that Draper's project could
continue to use about forty percent of the differential ene-
lyzer's time almost indefinitely and that about fifty percent
of the analyzer's time might be available for other work“

In answer to a query, Draper stated that he felt the
project would probably prefer to continue to control the dif-
ferential analyser for at least one more year, and that, in the

ensuing interim between now and the first of July 1952, he felt
they could make arrangements so that the extra fifty percent of
the analyzer's time would be made available to the Institute
and to other projects with the assistance and advice of the Com-
mittee. It was felt that precedents could be set up conce
those projects for which transfer of funds was needed and those
researches wnich could be given the use or the machine without
charge. It was suggested that we work these precedents up
mutually as the examples came along. This general proposal
seemed quite satisfactory to the Committee, and Morse indicated
that he would mention this discussion to Dr. Stratton, empha—
sizing, however, that Draper had not reached a final decision
concerning these questions.

' In answer to another query, Laning and Draper felt that
Verzuh could be relieved of his responsibilities concerning the
differential analyser this next term. They felt it was wise to
give Verzuh time to get his doctor's thesis under Way, and felt
that the Spring Term of this year might be the best time to do
so. ,

Morse mentioned a possible commercial use for the differ-
ential analyzer which had come to the attention of Professor
Den Hartog. Arrangements were made to confer with the repre-
sentatives of this company to see whether the project was one
meriting work on the machine.

Morse reported a coming meeting at Princeton concerned with
training for the use of computing machines. He asked that the
members of the Committee make suggestions on possible subjects
for discussion at this meeting. The thesis proposal of Salzer
was discussed. It was agreed that horse would write to Brown,
saying that the Committee recommended Salzer's thesis be a u
proved by the Electrical Engineering Department, and that gopal,
being on the thesis committee, would keep in touch with the _
work. The Committee also discussed the proposal for a labora«
tory course in digital computers to be given this coming term
by Mr. Adams° It was agreed that Morse should write the Elec—
trical Engineering Department recommending that this course be
given as a special problem course this coming term, the possi-
bility for permanent course number being taken up later.

The next meeting of the Committee will be some time the
first week of the second term. It was agreed that the Com-
