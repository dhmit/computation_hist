ENTRY

INTER-PROGRAM COMMUNICATION

The ENTRY pseudo-operation is used in the assembly of sub-
programs. Its purpose is to identify the subprogram to

the System by its name(s), and to identify the entry point(s)
of the subprogram. In this way it resembles the SUBROUTINE
statement in FORTRAN. For example, a trigonometric sub-
routine might have two entry points: one used when the

sine function is desired, and another which is used when

the cosine is desired. Such a routine might begin as

follows:

LOCATION OP VARIABLE FIELD
ENTRY SIN
ENTRY COS

SIN STO ARG

cos STO ARG2

The ENTRY pseudo-operation says to the assembler, ''This
program is a subprogram, and the name in the variable
field is a name of this subprogram. Place this name on
the program card together with the address of the cell
which bears this name as a location symbol." Each name
used in the variable field of an ENTRY pseudo-operation
must appear in the location field of some instruction.
The location field of the ENTRY pseudo-operation must

be blank. All ENTRY instructions must immediately follow
the FAP card and precede all other instructions. The
only exception to this rule is that a card with an asterisk

in column 1 (a ''remarks' card) may appear anywhere in the
