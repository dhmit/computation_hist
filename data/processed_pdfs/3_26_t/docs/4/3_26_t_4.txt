Dear Carl:
In accordance with our discussions concerning the charges

on DSR Project 6345, I have checked and determined thet the following
individuals have been improperly charged to this account:

 

2) Mr. Jack Dennis should never have been charged to this
account. Talking with him I understand that he should
be charged full time to DSR 7125.

bP) Similarly, Mr. B. Widrow has been charged to DSR 6345
and agein he should not have been charged to this account
elther for the regular term or the summer session. His
research time should be charged to one of Prof. Fletcher's
accounts (in building 10), either 7007 or 7019, but not
to 6345 which is Computation Center.

I bave tentatively made necessary budget appropriations for
Prof. Dean Arden who is, of course, working on 6345,

I am notifying the DSR office that they should not charge
individuals to DSR projects without authorization from the project
supervisor which in this case is F. M. Verzuh.

Thanks very much for helping me correct our accounts.

Sincerely yours,

MM. Verzuh
