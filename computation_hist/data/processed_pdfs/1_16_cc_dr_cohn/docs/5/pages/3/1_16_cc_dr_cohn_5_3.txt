1953] TWO NON-LINEARIZED CONICAL FLOWS 103

Thus xa/z = X“ (t) are conical characteristic surfaces for (2.1). A plane tangent to one
of them along the ray act/z 2 X0, must be tangent to the Mach cone (24) based on
u. = 14,-(X, , X2) with Vertex at the origin and must correspond to the tangent to the
characteristic Xa = X.(t). Hence the characteristic directions for (2.11) must be those
of the lines through (Xl , X2) tangent to the conic

(u.X: + w)? = (rf — a2><X:X: + I) (212)

with running coordinates X:. The type of (2.11) is hyperbolic, parabolic, or elliptic
accordingly as (X1 , X2) is outside, on, or inside (2.12). For a conical simple wave (211)
is of hyperbolic type (except possibly on a curve on which the type is parabolic), with
straight characteristics, Furthermore, a region of hyperbolic type adjacent to a region
of uniform ﬂow must be a conical simple wave.

3. Flow along a conical wall. It is well known that swept Prandtl—Meyer ﬂow over a
dihedral angle can be generalized into simple wave ﬂow past a curved cylindrical wall.
Now a generalization to simple wave ﬂow in a trough with boundaries composed of plane
and conidal segments will be discussed.

Consider uniform supersonic ﬂow along a plane wall on which Z is a line inclined with
respect to the direction of ﬂow by more than the Mach angle. Let P be any point on I.
Extend the boundary beyond I as a cone through I with vertex P, and eventually join
the cone to another plane segment Attempt to ﬁt a conical simple wave to this boundary.
Let the origin of coordinates be at P. Describe the boundary by

r. = 7‘1),(u) (3.1)
where r and M are independent, With no loss of generality assume
v,v,- = l, va.’ = l. (3.2)
Then
v,vf = vaf’ = 0, 0.1),” = —L (3.3)

Assume that the prototype planes pass through the rulings of (3.1). Then
ufv. = 0 (3 .4)

and the boundary condition on the cone becomes u. = Ar.» + BUC for some scalar func-
tions A(n) and B(p). By (33) and (34) B = A’, so
