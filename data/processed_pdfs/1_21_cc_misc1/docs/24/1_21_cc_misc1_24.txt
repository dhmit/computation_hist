PROPOSAL, FOR EXTENSION OF NSF GRANT No. NSFG2940
to June 30, 1960

in recent discussions with NSP staff it was suggested
that it would be appropriate to request funds for the next
three years, instead of Just for next year. Since the
program outlined in the Original Proposal, dated April 1956
and the recent Request for Extenslon, dated March 1957, is
for a three-year pericd, it certainly is appropriate to
request support for all three years now, since thls has been
suggested by NSF.

I am therefore appending to this an estimated budget
for the two years from July 1, 1958 to June 30, 1960, which
is to be considered as an additional part of the Proposal
sent to NSF by DSR April 9, 1957, extending it for two more
years.
