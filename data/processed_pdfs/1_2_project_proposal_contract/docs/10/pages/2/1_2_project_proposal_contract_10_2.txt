Reference: (Contract NSori-06001 DIC-#6345, #6915

l1tems as the preparation of summary reports on the program of
Machine Methods of Computation,

This summary is based on estimates prepared by Prof-
eggor P, M, Morse,

Professor Morse further advises that the expected
arrival of an IBM Type 704 Electronic Data Processing Machine at%
MIT about Januvary 1, 1957 will create a definite need for sddi-
Tlonal funds--to finance the converslon of existing Whirlwind
programg %to Type 704 programs,

Under the proposed plan submitted herewith, Project
#6345 (Whirlwind Operation) would terminate on June 30, 1957.
The task order for this period would include the usval Whirlwind
project activities: |

1. Research 1n methods of numerical analysis and
the formulation of scilentific problems for machine
solution, togefther with the %training of personnel
in these methods,

2, Support of the Sclentiflc and Ingineering Applica-
tione Group of Project Whirlwind so as to make the
computer useful and aveilsble for the above-mentioned
regearch,

In addition, 1t 1s proposed that the following task
order arlsing in connection with the Type 704 EDPM be included:

3. The development of a sulitsable interpretive program
and assoclated coding technlques to permit effective
implementation of the Type 704 machine,

It 1s anticlpated that a separate project will be set
up to handle the Type 704 utilization within the MIT Computation
Center, and a separate request To the ONR for support of this work
willl be made in the near future. In this respect certailn
experlenced progremmers could be made avallable for transfer to
this new task as of January 1, 1957, This enticipated transfer
has been taken into account in the budget pronosed for Project #6345,

The foregoing proposal does not take into consideration
termination costs which may be assoclated wlth the close out of
thls contract and the possible disposlition of the Whirlwind Computer.
It is proposed to delay the submlttal of sny budget for this matter
until such time as disposltion of the Whirlwind Computer 1is
determined,
