Admittedly, these users are performing either D.I.C. sponsored research
or thesis research which can presumably be performed equally well at aay
location except for possible personal inconvenience.

 

Realistically, however, it is well to n√©tice the similarity
betwsen the proposed space change iz OBS and the existing spatiasl separa-
tion of the Whirlwind Computer located in the Barts Building. In the
case of Whirlwind, it was found that the physical separation from M.I.T.
main buildings was so critical that a specially-staffed Problem Inguiry
and Preparation Room (Room 10-212) had to be installed during 1953. 1In
this manner, staff "who would never walk to Barta" are encouraged to
use the facility. It is alse of interest to mnote that a complete,
duplicate punched~card instellstion wes set up at the Instrumentation
Laboratory to minimize the traffic problem between Whittemore and
Building 7.

Epace Requirements for the Office of Statistical Services

A consideration of the floor plans reveals that 085 currently
occupies the following space:

Bay Area (8q. Ft.)

308 350

3-411 360

3-413 960

3-423 480

3-427 350 (storage)

7-308 350

Dome 400 (storage)
Total = 3240

For the seke oi ithe vecord, it is well to indicate the space curreantly
associated with the Differential Analyzer (RDA):

Bay Ares . Ft.)
7-302 (2) 700
7-303 (4) 1400
3328 350
Totel = 2450

This space will be available as soon as the RIUA is destroyed. As 2 matter
of fact, the Machire Shop (Room 7-302) has been transferred te R. 10~-48]1,
and Bay 7-302 is now availsble for renovation.

Space Request Made by Computation Committee

In accordance with the long-range plans for a Computation Center
prepared by the Machine Computation Committee, & request for four additi-
tional bays of space was made on April 233, 1954. At that time it was
