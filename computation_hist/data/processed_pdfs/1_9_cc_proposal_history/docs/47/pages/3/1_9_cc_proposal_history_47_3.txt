(one senior administrator, 6 St e

to 10 computer-technicians, 4 to 6
research assistants plus the 8 technicians now employed’by the

Institute for M.I.T. administrative machine work) could erhaps

be born by the Institute in the way we support s%op techgiciags,

a8 a necessary part of an educational staff. The sclentific
aupervision could come from faculty members already here. If

there were free time over and above the worthwhile educational
research needs of the Institute, computing time could be sold to
DIC and DDL projects for enough to pay for part or all of the
salaries of this programming staff. For example, if 1/# of the
time were available for DIC work, and the DIC projects pald at a
rate corresponding to the commercisl rentals of the IBM equipment
($28,000 per month), they would just about pay for the programming
staff salaries. It probably would not be wise to allow DIC projects
to have too large a fraction of machine time, even at the first '
and it not be wise to sell computer time to any outside organiza-
tion, for this would be competing with companies that pay full
rates for their IBM eguipment.

 

Unfortunately, if Whirlwind 1s to be the high-speed part
of this combination, the costs will be considerably greater than
those outlined in the preceding parsgraph. Whirlwind is still an
excellent machine, but it was one of the first ones built and it
was not designed for space-saving or for cheapness of upkeep. It
could not be easily moved, so that if a combined computer service
were to be set up, the IBM equipment of Statistical Services would
have to be moved to the Barta Building, further away from the ad-
ministrative offices it serves than it 18 now. Or else two sepa-
rate groups would have to be continued, with consequent duplications
of personnel.

IBM Interest - The IBM Corporation has a considerable interest in
the training of scientists and engineers in the use of computing
equipment, and 1t has had some contacts with the Institute. In
another two years it will be turning out equipment (types 704 and
705) which will be nearly as fast as Whirlwind, will be better
equipped as to input and output facilities, will be considerably
smaller in s8ize and power requirements and which will f£it much
better with our present IBM equipment to make a single computing
service center. If IBM can be ‘induced to give us a remodelled 70l
or a 704 or 705, rent-free, and to remit further charges on the
equipment Statistical Services now has but keeping up maintenance
of the equipment, the Institute would then have a computing center
which could effectively and efficiently satisfy the computing
needs in categories a, b and ¢c. M.I.T. itself would then only need
to pay for the service staff and the power costs, which might be
paid in part by some pald computing service for DIC and DDL projects.
