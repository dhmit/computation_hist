put out a combined progress report. In some published papers,
credit could be given to one organization alone; in others, credilt
would go to both. Bookkeeping would be somewhat more complicated,
but since most of the expense would be for salaries, little for
permanent equipment, this could be done. It probably would be
necessary to have the usual government overhead for both contracts.

The proposed budget asked of each agency for 1956-57 1is
given below. The corresponding amounts for the following two years
would be g45,000 for 1957-58 and 50,000 for 1958-59, as indicated
- above,

Proposed Research; Possible Initial Directions of Investigation:

1. Investigation of Structure and Syntax of input
languages; the poessibilities of coding directly in mathematical,
logical or business language.

2. Development of routines capable of translating from
algebraic notation to computer code and vice versa, including
possibly automatic selection of numerical techniques and automatic
error analysis. S

3, Development of numerical analytic techniques particu-
larly suitable for use by digital computers; such as more general
expansions, truncated Chebyshev polynomials sums for simulating
standard functions by a common block of instructions but small
separate blocks of coefficients and cycle counters and methods of
automatic determination of best grid spacing, by trlal plus
Richardson extrapolation or other means.

I}, Investigation of Monte Carlo techniques for large
problems.

5., Extension and/or improvement of present techniques
for communication between machine and operator and for the more
flexible control of machine operation, including possible improve-
ments in input-output equipment.
