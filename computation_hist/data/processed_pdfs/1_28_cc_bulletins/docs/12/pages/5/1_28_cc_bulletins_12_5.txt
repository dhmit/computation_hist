in the expansion of the following call the second argument of SKIP will be
substituted, commas and all (but with the outermost parems stripped off), in
place of the dummy NAME

KBAC SKIP,TPL, (ADD,(X,1) Y, 2) 22
The result of the two macro expansions is the generated sequence

Normally, printing of generated imstructions will be suppressed @

The Pseudo-operation IRP A

This instruction is used in pairs withnn a macro, to begin and emnd
a block of instructions, The result will be that the block of imstructioms so
bracketed will be repeated once for each subargument of argument A, with A on
each repetition replaced by successive subarguments, A must be a SAP expression
defined before appearance of the imstruction in a MAC call, For example, the
routine

MOP SUMSQ,T,B

STZ T

IRP B
