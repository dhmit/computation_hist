The dbnsenaus of opinion seems to b√© that luncheon on
Tuesday, March 12, is the best time for the organizational
meeting of the Advisory Council on Machine Applications in
the'Social Seiences. Accordingly, we will meet at 12.05 p.m.
at the M.I.T. Faculty Club on the Sixth Floor of the Sloan
Building, 50 Memorial Drive. The particular dining room
will be in my name on the bulletin beoard directly opposite

the elevators. I hope to see you there then.
