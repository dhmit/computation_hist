Es(z) in terms of a fifth derivative (where the perturbation circle has
dieameter ¢/q’, etc.). But since the perturbed upper half plane

would not be invariant under the modular group, modular functions
would be inapplicable.

expansions, in addition to requiring a ma.]m.'ant argument, are
dependent on the special nature of the perturbation. The expansion
(10) will therefore be proved by.a. more general method. .S.mce the
arguments are profuse and classical, it is hoped that a minimum of

detail will prove satisfactory.
