1 have completed the ﬂoor layout plans of the RAM room
in the basement a! Bldg. 26 and now realize that we probably do not
have an adequate number of vodﬂers ‘ln our plans for the Colputation
Center. You will recall that the original decision regarding [AI
complement was made by Messrs. Kurd and ﬂuson prior to your appoint-
ment as educational representative, and at that time we had: one key
punch and one verifier in the installation. During the summer you
and I discussed the key punching requirements and increased the
number to the present total of six.

At the present tine in our operaLion of Whirlwind, we have
the following equipment:

Gran! Eguigment
Professional Group 3 I‘lexowriten
3 Veriﬁere
l Comparator
salt-Service Unit 3 Tape Perterntors
3 Vetiﬂers

1 Comparator

If we were to attempt to extrapolate from the Whirlwind operation, it
would appear that we need more verifiers. In View of the delivery of
veritiere, I would like to suggest that we place an order for two (2)
