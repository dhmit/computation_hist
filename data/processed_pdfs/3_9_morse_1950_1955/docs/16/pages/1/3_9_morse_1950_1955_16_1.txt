Prof. P. M. Morse V//
R. 6-109

Dear Professor Morse:

In accordance with our discussions concerning the
Atomic Wave Function Tables, I have had a 5-part listing of this
table prepared, and I am enclosing 4 copies for your use.

You will notice that the format does not agree identi-
cally with that which was used on the Master Table previously
prepared for future publication. The reason for this is that
we have used standard 14 7/8" x 11" paper on the present listing,
whereas previously we used 15" x 17" paper (which is a special
paper used for photographic purposes).

Identification and columnar headings have been made on
the original copy only. Yilmaz or someone may caption succeeding
copies prior to distribution for use in the Machine Computation
Group.

Sincerely yours,

F. M. Verzuh
