exist, where W = (uy, ..., u,) is a vector of the module formed from each of
Q + 1 properly chosen units %, of K. The set of Q + 1 vectors R[u] will be
called a stability configuration. The actual choice of the Q =+ 1 units %,, as we
shall indicate, is not only extremely difficult, but it accentuat
in the infinitesimal behavior of the units of Ky for different N.
Nevertheless the finding of these Q 4+ 1 vectorsu or R[u] would be desirable
in view of the fact that a modular reduction theorem automatically enlarges the
“neighborhood”” of a stable lattice (possibly to the whole lattice space, thus
establishing a critical lattice, as in the quadratic case (12, p. 268)). For instance,
take the following simple-looking set of % units of Ky (for N prime > 5):

It is found by very laborious calculations (which we omit) that the resulti: . J
Q4+ 1 vectors R[u] provide a stability configuration when N = 5,7, 13 but /-
that these vectors are not even of rank Q when N = 11. The question of .whether D
or not the integer-module of K provides a critical lattice for t!le norm in 7 real
dimensions is answered positively for N = 5,7 (3), and negatively for N = '13
(11), while for N = 11 the answer is still unknown. It would'probably be wise
to exhibit a sufficiently simple stability configuration for the integer-module in
K1 before trying to establish it as a critical lattice.
