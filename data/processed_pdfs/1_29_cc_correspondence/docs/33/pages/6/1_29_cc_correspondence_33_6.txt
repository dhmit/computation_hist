IV. lunuals for the 799

o -

The following IBM Manuals willl be availlable at Center

 

Headquarters (Room 26-142) to all persons from MIT or the

New England colleges who have an active interest in programming

for the 709. (Some manuals are temporarily unavaillable.)

Inasmuch as these rather expensive manuals are donated by 1IBMN,

the Center feels it is proper to ask each person who wishes a

manual to sign for 1it.

1. T709-7090 Reference Manual (Form A22-6503-1).

(The basic reference manual for the 709

and 7090. The somewhat older 709 manual is

still essentially correct.)

2. Fortran Primer (Form F28-6019). (This
manual, which has been used with the 704,

 

 

is unchanged for the 709.)

W

 

 

709 Fortran Reference Manual (Form C28-6054).
Since there is essentially no change from
704 Fortran, this material is simply a con-

solidation of the 704 Fortran Reference

Manual and the 704 Fortran II Supplementary

Manual.)

4., 709 Fortran Monitor Reference Manual (Form
C

28-6065). (A description of the Fortran-

FAP Monitor System.)

In addition, the Center will make available the following

material:

l. A description of the FAP Assembly Program

2. A Manual of Procedures and Conventions at

the Center.

V. Conventions and Procedures

l. Unless there are reasons otherwise,

Fortran-FAP Monitor System should be used.
