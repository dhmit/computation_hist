President Killian h&s referred your
letter of 11 Janvary to me. This was with regard
to the eligibility of your Institution for parti-
cipation in our cooperative program for use of an
IBM Tyve 704 Electronic Datea Processing Machine,
At this time I hesitate to give you a definite
answer since the machine is to be used primarily
for educeational purnoses by colleges and uni-
versities in the New England area. Our accent is
to be on training people how to uvuse the facility
and the types of things it can do rather thean on
the solution of specific problems. For example,
we do not propose to &accept problems and return
solutions. Rather, we propose to ask anyone who
heÃ©s & problem to solve it himself with the zid of
ean instructing staff.

The facility will not be availeble for
another year. I would like to propose that we
postpone & decision on your eligibility for parti-
cipation and, in the meantime, arrange for a
meeting to discuss the problem with you when you
are in Cambricge.

Very truly yours,

Carl F. Floe
