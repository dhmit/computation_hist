Dear Jack:

Our Whirlwind research progrem for the
MIT Reactor has struck pay dirt, and as usually
happens, we need to extend our calculations in
order to preeent 2 satisfactory hazards evalua=
~ tion to the Atomic Energy Commisalon. The trang
ent studies we are doing can be extended easily,
but we need machine time in order to do this,

Accordingly, I would like to request that

twenty hours of time on Whirlwind be assigned to
problem 266 for the coming term,

Very truly yours,

~~ T, Cantwell
