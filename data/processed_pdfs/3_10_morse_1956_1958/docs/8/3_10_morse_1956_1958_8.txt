Dear Joe:

I have been saying no to bids for membership on various
advisory committees for some time, for fear I would end up spending
all my time on committees and none of it at MIT. However, this
committee looks a3 though it has some interesting problems and an
interesting membership and I think I should make an exception to
my general negative response, However, I should warn you that I
am rather busy and I cannot guarantee to spend a great deal of
time on committees work, Ia particular, it will be impossible for
me tc attend the April 21st meeting, I guess I could atisnd about
two meetings a year of the committee from then on and probably
would be ahle to make the meetings if I were given waraing about
two months in advance of each meeting so I could searrange other
plans,

If the fact that I cannot attend your first mecting and
that I cannot spend much more than two days a year at the job
appears to be too restricted to you, then I am afraid 1 must say
no, regratfully, On the other hand, if yon don't mind a rather
busy member who will try to he at the meetings, I would very much
like to become a member and attend whenever I can.

Please let me know what your decision is and let me

know as soon as possible when the next meeting of the committee
will be.

Yours,

Philip M, Morse
Director
