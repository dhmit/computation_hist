Dear Admirel Smithy

President Killian hes referred your
letter of 11 Janvary to me. This was with regard
to the eligibility of your Institution for parti-
cipation in our cooperative program for use of an
IBM Tyne 704 Electronic Data Processing Machine,
At this time I hesitate to give you a definite
answer since the machine is to be used primarily
for educational purnoses by colleges and uni-
versities in the New England area. Our accent is
to be on training people how to use the facility
and the types of things it can do rather then on
the solution of specific problems. For example,
we do not propose to &ccept problems and return
solutions. Rather, we propose to ask anyone who
hes a problem to solve it himself with the sid of
Ã©n instructing staff.

The facility will not be aveileble for
another year. 1 would like to propose that we
postpone & decision on your eligibility for parti-
cipation and, in the meantime, arrange for a
meeting to discuss the problem with you when you
are in Cambricge.

Very truly yours,

Carl F. Floe
