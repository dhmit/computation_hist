» 1t also appears likely that some of the more long-range research

Projects of the sort, supported by this contract in the past, will still
be going on,

For example, cosmic-ray measurements and particle accelerator
Reasurements, carried out in the Laboratory of Nuclear Science, are
coming to use digital computers to analyze the data. We have been
Cooperating with them to investigate methods whereby such measurements
can be recorded directly on cards or tape and programmed so that the
analysis can be carried out directly by the machine without further
manual transcription of data. This work will continue, as will the
investigation of various means of displaying the results of the machine
calculations. Other long-range investigations, such as that on
artificial intelligence, also come within the scope of the task orders
for NSori-60.

4 It is therefore proposed that the Office of Naval Research be
requested to continue Contract NSori-60 for the year beginning July 1, 1958,
without additional funds, to continue support of long-range research of the
sort described in the Contract’s present task orders until the balaance of
the funds is exhausted. These funds would be used chiefly for personnel
salaries and might be allocated as follows:

Senior Mathematician (1 year) $ 9,000
2 Technicians or Programmers 11,000

{at about $5,500 per year each) 20,000
Overhead, at 45% 9,000
Travel 500
Incidentszls (production of reports, 500

office supplies, etc.)

TOTAL $30,000

If the unexpended balance on June 30, 1958, turns out to be less
or more than the ostimated $30,000, this budget could be modified accordingly
to run for a shorter or longer time than an additicnal year,
