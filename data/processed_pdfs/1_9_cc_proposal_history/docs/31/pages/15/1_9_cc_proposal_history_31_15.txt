ficlents. The machine employs a 400-cps suppressed- carrier voltage
a8 the data carrier, has a variable tlme scale, and can handle
a great many parameters. ItAhas 14 electromechanical integrators
each with 5 output units so that, for example, the valuess of Xy
x2, x3, xn, and x‚Äù can be obtained from a single unit., If re-
Bolvers rather than potentiometers are used as putput units,
linear combinations of sines and cosines of the integral of the
input can be obtained. The machine has a number of summing
clrcults, coefficient potentiometers, and 3 high-speed multi-
pliers. Each component has an accuracy of 0.1% of full Scale.
The output recording equipment consists of Brush oscillographs
and a plotting table with two recording arms. The machine,
which has a high Speed of operation, gilves a solution to many
types of problems in less fhan a minute,
In addition, the laboratory has several smaller sections
of computing equipment:
1. A d-c analog computer consisting of equipment similar
to that used in REAC.
2. A medium-speed single-axis flight tabile.
3. A high-speed 8ingle-axis flight table.
4, Equipment for generating the following types of noise:
a. Continuous noise with 3 Gaussian amplitude proba-
bility distribution ang various power spectra.
b. Square-wave noise with fixed amplitude but with
random times of changing from positive to negative
polarity.

c. Discrete variable nolse available on teletype tape.
