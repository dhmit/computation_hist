Dear Professor Morse:

Many thanlm for your letter of July 12. I will
be here the week of August 6 but away from August 13 until
after Labor Day.

I hope that you trill not make a special trip to
New York on my account. If, however, you should be coming
here for some other purpose -- either during the week of
August 6 or later in September -- I would be very pleased
to see you. W secretary, Miss Harris, will be glad to
fix an appointment if you will get in touch with her when
your plans are settled.

Sincerely yours,

//
