machines such as an IBM, No. 605, and a Card Program Cal-
culator, plus one high-speed machine, such as Whirlwind I
or the IBM Defense Calculator could easily handle the load
and still have time available to schedule thesis and general
research problems. Possible budgets for such a combination
are discussed later.

It would, of course, be necessary to have a small
staff to help in the imstruction and to keep the equipment
running effectively. If all equipment were IBM, no main-
tenance staff would be needed; if Whirlwind I were part of
the combination, two or three technicians would be required.
It would be desirable, for at least two reasons, to keep the
service staff small in number. The obvious reason is the
budgetary one. Another reason is that it would be desirabdble
to have the thesis and research computing handled as much
as possible on a "self-service”" basis; the persons do the
research and desiring the results should help in the goding
and should help run the equipment. Apart from the cational
value of the self-service policy, it is true that most effec-
tive utilization of machine computation comes when ¢
doing the research learms enough about coding and machine
operation to be able to adapt the general procedures té his
particular problem. In addition, such self-service réquire- -
ments will sutomatically limit demands on the eguipment ‘to
those problems where the need of machine computation is real.
When coding and processing is all done by a service staff)
the temptation i3 great to "put a problem on the machine
before it has really been thought through, and mnoh*waag
of machine time results. G

  
 
   
 

The staff of the machine center should, o:u;gurae,
be large enough so that it will not be continually burdened
with service duties, or it is liable to josg its enthusiasm.
The senior members of the service staff should have some time .
to carry on research of their own, to work on special coding
programs and to improve machine operation. An appropriate
staff would meed to include two or three members of the faculty,
from several departments, who would each spend part of their
time planning and supervising the use of the equipment by the
various laboratory courses of instruction which include

machine operation in their curriculur. There must, of course,
be a full-time supervisor, who would be responsible for
scheduling and maintaining the egquipment and for supeprvising
the service staff, which would consist of two or thre¢ senior
coder-technicians and two or three operatora. If Whiflwind I
i8 part of the combination, at least two maintensnce %tech-
niicians would also be needed. Such a staff could handle

both course load and gemsral research needs if the gemneral
research work were carried out on a self-service basis as
outlined above.
