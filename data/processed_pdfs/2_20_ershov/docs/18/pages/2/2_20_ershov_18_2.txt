pagg Two April 13, 1959

We would hope to make Plans for you to talk to other American computer
mathematicians not only at Chapel Hill and Cambridge, but also along your
itinerary from New York to Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill to Cambridge, Massachusetts,
and Cambridge back to New York.

A8 you will see from the enclosed announcement of the Conference, we have
invited other Computer scientists from Germany, France, Switzerland, aad in
addition, Great Britain, to lecture. We feel that the meeting and the people
attending should be of interest to you and your colleagues. The lectures, of
course, are to come under the agreement on exchange of persons between the
United States and the Soviet Union; and it would be expecied that a like number
of U. 5. computer scientists would be iavited to pay a similar visit to the Soviet
Union, perhaps to give a similar series of lectures,

I would appreciate your conferring with Academicians Lebedev and Dorodnitsin
and Dr. Ershov about this possible trip, and would appreciate hearing from you
48 soon as possible. 1 look forward personally to meeting you again. Pleage
don't hesitate to reply in Russian.

Sincerely yours,
