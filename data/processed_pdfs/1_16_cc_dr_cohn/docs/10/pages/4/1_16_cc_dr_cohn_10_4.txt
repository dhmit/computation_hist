Lemaa 19.1. No complete chain of reduced neighboring quadruples

can consist entirely of mediants.

; Proof. Suppose R is the small vector of a mediant ¢. Then any
AR AP A v neighbor operation with B “in the middle ” is valid. Take in particular

AT AA (PRS): We can apply the neighbor operation only a limited number of

times, e. g.,

(19.2) ¢ (PRS)¢’(PRS)¢” - - - ¢,

(since the operation decreases p; (> 0) by | 7, | each time). Now if ¢®
is still a mediant, the small vector must be @ (because it is no longer “E ”
and yet | p.| and |s.| now exceed |7, |). We therefore apply (P@S) as
long as possible until we obtain a ¢®™. This process must terminate since
the operations (PQS) and (PRS) each decrease p, (> 0) by | ¢ | or | 7|
each time. Q. E.D.

We are now ready to handle the non-mediant quadruples. We are again
confronted with a multitude of special cases that would be tedious to give In
detail. We therefore first make use of limiting sets.

Oullme‘ of proof. An' actual listing of the twenty-four different types

that only two types are mediants. The remaining twenty-two types reveal
limiting sets on inspection, but the amount of space required to handle the “*'r"':"{:":'-f""""'."":f"f'*':’
