Dear Walter:

In response to your call of July 21st, I have the following
comments from M.I.,T, concerning the agenda for the next SHARE meeting,
Not all of these ideas are equally valid, nor do some of them merit
any further consideration, However, I'll put them down just so the
Executive Board may be able to see a better approach to another topic
for the agenda,

 

It isn’t clear to me whether everyone realizes how to use in

an ordinary way the under-overflow SQ after it is installed in the 704,

In particular, there are two cases, that of Fortran and that of SAP,

On one hand, this seems pretty trivial; on the other hand, people are

continuing to do rather foolish things, g How about some wise sage (such

as Walter Ramshaw) getting up and discussing in a philosophical way the
| usually unmentionable subject of errors - in particular, machine, coding,
and formulation, I find in personal discussions that people have their
nose so close to one type of problem that they have never considered the
larger question that all computing ventures represent a calculated risk,
Therefore, the sophisticated user knows of a whole sequence of precaufion-
ary steps which may be taken, although he only uses as many as he feels
the importance of the approach warrants, The extreme solution is when
the Russians and the Americans do the same job simultanecusly,

 

Another topic which might be a forum or ome or two individuals,
but which would require preparation on the part of the participants, is,
How does one teach a beginning programmer to use the 709 computer im all
of its glory? Obviously, one can teach the 704 first and them suggest
that there are a few more things one can do on the 709, but this isn't
very helpful, Specific items that come to mind are, Does one try to
teach a subset of instructions and operational procedures and, if so,
along what lines? and finally, Would D, McCracken be a good man to have
as an invited speaker?

The next idea that comes to mind is essentially one that was
used at the last ACM meeting, where there was an open discussion of com-
puters which not only did arithmetic but also carried along an indication
of the accuracy of the numbers which were stored, Even at the ACM
meeting, the notion of error propagation being treated in better than an
abstract way seemed novel to some of the participants, The specific items
which should be brought out are procedures carrying along probable error
(an unsure compromise), # procedurescarrying along maximum error (this
usually says that the results have mo significance), and finally, the
procedure of range numbers, wherein the number being calculated is con-
tained in the range of the two values, It should be brought out that, in
contrast to the first two procedures which indicate nothing about the con-
vergence of the process, the range method faithfully reflects numerically
convergent (and divergemt) procedures, Of course, all of the above remarks
should be prefaced by the suggestion that the various procedures can be
simulated and warrant further study,

It might be an interesting novelty to those persons who like to
listen better than they like to read, to have a lecture or two on mew computing
machines, in the sense that a discussion of the features and specifications
be made, Inasmuch as I.,B.,M, does not make all machines, there are clearly
political overtones to this suggestion,

Finally, to enter into the blue-sky realm, it would be nice if
anyone had interesting things to say about the use of real-time inter-
vention and interaction with computers, In particular, I am thinking of
such devices as light guns, analog computers, and, in the field of data
processing, parallel operations by, say, n clerks using 1 computer with
intimate feedback, This subject leads naturally into the discussion of
blue-sky hardware and I wonder if any more could be said about such ideas
of machine design as multi-control computers with control hierarchies
under fixed and/or computer-set priorities (the TX-2 Computer of Lincecln
Laboratory, built under the supervision of Wes Clark, is a start in this
direction),

I consider the above to be a sketch of ideas which I hope will
help the Executive Board think of better ones, You will note that I have
not mentioned compilers or FORTRAN, primarily because I am sure they will
be talked about anyway by the loquacious set, I really am interested in
both subjects and consequently it makes me feel like a killjoy to suggest
some of the SHARE gabble is hot air, Constructive discussion is welcome,

Hope this helps,

Sincerely,

F, J, Corbato
