A consideration of the attached statistics reveals several iﬁems
which are worthy of mention. Specifically, some of the thesis research
is quite expensive as illustrated in the case of Jack Uretsky‘s
problem 235 in which he has spent $13,925 during a 6-month period: As
a maﬁter of fact, he has spent $18,152,370 on this problem since
November, 1954. Similarly. B. Campbell has spent $12,8Sé. ou problem 245
during this Gwmon’ch pearl 0d, and 31538623955 since November, 1954:.
Likewise, Mr.» K» Bryan has spent $1,870‘du1-ing the past six months and
a total of $319,941.60 since November, 19.54:. I ﬁhink the Gwmon'hh expenditure
of Slater's group - 3329,092.74 is. 8. Earl? indication of the efforts of“
his group. Furtheymore, his group has» spent $47,944n25 since
