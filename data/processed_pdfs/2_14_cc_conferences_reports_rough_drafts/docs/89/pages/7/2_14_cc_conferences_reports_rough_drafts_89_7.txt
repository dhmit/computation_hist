Time

- Computer time will be scheduled for use in teaching in
indusirial management courses and for faculty and student research
problems in indusirial management and econonics, In general, thereiore,

- the machine will be devoted almost entirely to academic purposes in the
management and associated fields, The pattern of research in the School
of Industrial Management has not in the past produced supported research
projects, Ouwr policy will be to devote the major portion of prime use to
academic or unsupported research. Bupported research may in time develop
from special projects in economics or management, but it is unlikely in the
first year. It is likely, on the other hand, that we will need additional
usage on second shifts in academic research.

supervision and Administration

The installation will be administered by the Schoel of Indusirial
Management under the gver-all responsibility of the Dean of the School.
