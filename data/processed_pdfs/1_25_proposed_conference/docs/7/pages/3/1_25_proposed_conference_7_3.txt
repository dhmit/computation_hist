4. (Bxchange of Personnel between Well-established and Novlybfornod
0/R groups).

Dr, Morse reported that several military and industrigl
O/R groups in U.8., U.K. and France have indicated their willingness
to help implement this fourth recommendation of the Panel and that
some of the liaison was already going on. At present, however, no
a-qdorganization has knovledge of most of the activity in this area,
so a great deal of duplication and lost effort has result@d. The
Panel believes that the liaison between groups, at the working level,
is of great importance for the dcvolonpent of O/Rs It suggests that th
steps be taken Sorthat the 0ffice' of ‘the Science Advisor to NATO be
informed of such liaiaon activity be*wéen NATO O/R groups at all
levels, not for control purposes but for information so that groups
underteking such liaison can find out what has gone on in this
area and can adjust their efforts accordingly.

The Panel whishes to re-emphasize its belief in the desirabi
1lity of these four approved areas of activity, to indicate its inten-
tion to help further their development and to request the backing
of the Science Committee in the methods of implementation suggested

in this report., It is also in agreement that the recent formation

of national O/R Bocieties in many NATO countries is a sign of the
healthy growth of the subject and that the developement of the In-
ternational Pederation of 0/R societies (IFORS) vhich orgenized the
Conference at Aix, could usefully assist the Panel in its task,
