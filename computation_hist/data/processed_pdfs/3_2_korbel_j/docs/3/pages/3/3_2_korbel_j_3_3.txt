labor market area,

Here again, the exact definitiom of variables will be influemced
by the definitioms under which the most promising data was gathered, Thus,
for example, with regard to the definitiom of region, urbanization and
labor market areas, we shall adopt the categories and boundaries used by
the Census Bureau and the Department of Lnbor.1 With regard to ecomomic
characteristics, we may for example, adopt as a measure of mon-earned wealth
"other” (than earned) income instead of assets simply because the former
and not the latter is reported im the most promising source of data, At
least at this preliminary stage, it would seem that the most efficiemt use
of resources could be made by studying pertinent variables as we find
them in the available data sources,

Of course, the initial decision with regard to pertimence
is based upon common knowledge and imtrospectiom, Thus whatever we can
find relating to age, race, marital status, children, and relatiomship to
head of family is obviously pertinent, After the statistical analysis, it
may be revealed that some of the variables or distinctions betweem intervals
on a variable are not significamt and at that time we may drop variables or
conscolidate intervals,

The past labor force status of individuals comstitutes ome of
the most troublesome of the independent variables because of its obvious
pertinence combined with the paucity of reasonably accessible data relating
to it, The probability that an imdividual will be in the laber force in
any givea month is obviously heavily dependent upoa whether or mot he
was ia the labor force last month, last year, or ever before, And yet,
unless the right questions about the past are asked, a single questicmmaire
tells us éomly about the labor force status of an individual inm relatiom to
his preseat characteristics, Unfortunately, the right questioms have
seldoa been asked, The Current Populatioa Surveys im their aammual work
experience supplements do ask about labor force participation during the
year prior, but the published results are too crudely cress-classified for
our purposes, Three qdirtors of the households in the Current Population
