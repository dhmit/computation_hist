In accordance with the terms of the meeting held in Dr. Stratton's
office on Jaanuary 21, 1954, the operating staff of RDA were informed on
February 2, 1954 that the RDA facility would be closed effective July 1, 1954 --

pending delivery of the Card Programmed Calculator which has been ordered by
the Instrumentation Laboratory. |

Several alternative-methods for disposing of RDA have been suggested;
however, no definite decision has been reached regarding its disposition. This

action should be initiated in the very near future while existing manpower
is still available. T

Office of Statistical Services

The operation of the 0.S8.8. differs from the previously-described
facilities in several respects. First, it is a service group which serves
the needs of the entire MIT family, and, &s such, the following functions are
performed:

1. Nechanization of Administrative Activities,
2. Scientific Computation for Academic and DIC Projects,
3. Educational Teaching and Research.

Second, the operating costs of this office are recovered by a cost alloca-
tion system which charges the customer for the use of the facility. IBM
computing equipment is utilized and the operating costs reflect the IBM
rental charges. During the past year, a very effective Self-Service mode

of operationlms been applied to the operation of the Card Programmed
Calculator (CPC). The success of the method of operation is evidenced by
the fact that the need for the CPC has increased to the extent that a

second CPC has been ordered for use by the Instrumentation Laboratory.

In addition, an IBM Type 650 Drum Calculator has beenm ordered and is expected
to arrive sometime in 195S5.

Whirlwind Computer (Wwl)

The statistics pertaining to Whirlwind were obtained from

Messrs. Jack Porter and Robert Nelson of the WW1l staff. Since the sub-
mitted data applied to the activities of the Scientific and Engineering
Computation Group (SEC) (DIC 6345), which represents about 20% of Whirlwind
application time, & number of simplifying assumptions and approximations
were made in the determination of existing operating costs. Statistics
representing the utilizaetion of WWl by the SEC group were obtained from the
biweekly progress reports for 1953.
