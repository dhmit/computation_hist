BOUTS TAPE WRITING ROUTINE

Calling sequence: TSX BOUTS,L

PZE N, 0, FWA

Error Return

SLW (normal return)
This routine writes the block of N words starting at FWA on MT-NINE and
computes the CAD checksum. Tape is then backspzced and reread to check
for a legible record. Failure of the check causes a second writing and
check, failure of which causes error return On nomal return, CAD
checksum ig in AC to be stored for later use with BLINS. Index 1 is

destroyed.

BLINS TAPE READING ROUTINE

Calling sequence: GCAL (pickup checksum for this block)

TSX BLINS,L4

PZE N, 0, FWA

Error Return

Normel Return
This routine reads the next block of N words from MT-NINE into core memory
starting at location ¥WA, A CAD checksum is compared with the contents of
AC at entry. On disggreement, tape is backspaced and a second attempt at
reading is made. Failure of this attempt results in an error return. Pre-
sence of an end-of-file or end-oferecord before N words sre read also initiates

the error procedure. Index 1 is destroyed.
