Analytical Department

East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

Dear Ed:

I believe I can make our meeting on May 10
this way. I have to be here on May 9 until 5:00 p.m,
If I can get to Pittsburgh before 9:00 a.m. the next
morning, we could have the morning of the tenth, for
my date with the Pittsburgh Physical Society iz not
until afternoon or evening. Can this be done, and
would from 9:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. (say) on May 10 be o.k.?

Yours,

Philip M. Morse
