It was pointed out to Professors Shoemaker and Starr that
assistantships in this general field were available and that if
either of them had a good graduate student who is interested in ap-
plying machine methods to the problems in which they were interest-

ed, it was possible these students should apply for such an as-
sistantship.

The next meeting of the Committee will be Wednesday,
January 9. Morse will attempt to have a representative from the
Chemical Engineering and the Civil Engineering Departments present
to discuss some of their problems.
