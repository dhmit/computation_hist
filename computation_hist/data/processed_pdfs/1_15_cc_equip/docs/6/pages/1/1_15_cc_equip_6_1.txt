Memorandum to: F. M. Verzuh

Subject: Office Purmiture

I have looked over the furniture in the pent-
house of the Faculty Club. The padded, swivel chair
is satisfactory as a desk chalr for me. The only
chalr there which 1s nearly satisfactory as an easy
chair 1s the wood, cushioned one with grey fabric

- (not those with leather or with yellow fabric). I

would prefer one a bit deeper and with higher back,
but i1f one such costs considerably more than the
grey fabric sample, it will do.
