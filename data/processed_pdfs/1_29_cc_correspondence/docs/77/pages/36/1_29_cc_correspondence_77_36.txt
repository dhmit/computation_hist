from heading.

The form of the HEAD pseudo-operation is: blanks in the
location field, HEAD in the operation field, and a single

character (letter Or digit) in the variable field.

The form of the HED pseudo-operation 1s:  the heading
character (lettor Or digit) in column 1 of the card, HED

in the operation field. The variable field is ignored,

For both HEAD and HED pseudo-operations, a blank heading
character on the card is taken by the FAP assembler to

be the heading character zero,

The dollar sign, "$", is used in a special way in order
to make references from one headed section of a program
to another headed section. The dollar sign separates the

heading reference from the symbol; no heading reference

 

is needed when referring to a zero, or unheaded, section,
For éxample, A$X refers to the symbol ¥ in the A-headed

section, and $X refers to X in the unheaded Ssection,

The TCD Pseudo-operation is used to cause the punching
of a binary transfer card before the end of the binary
deck. TCD must appear in the Ooperation field, and a
symbolic expression designating the point of transfer

must appear in the variable field,

and for absolute assemblies cause the Ppunching of a binary
transfer card. END appears in the operation field and a

Ssymbolic expression representing the pPoint of traisfer in

the variable field.
