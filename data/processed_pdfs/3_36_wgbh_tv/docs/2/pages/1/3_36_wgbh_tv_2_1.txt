Dear Professor Morse:

Thanks for your note about the TV series on computers.
We've been busy and have let this slide too long.

David Huffman has decided that he cannot take on responsibility
for a long series. He would be glad to serve on a planning committee
and/or participate in a couple of half-hour programs, but his schedule
will not permit him to assume as much responsibility and devote as
much time to it as we suggested.

So we shall have to find another star. Dr. Samuel J. Mason
of Electrical Engineering, and Dr. George B. Thomas, Jr., of
Mathematics, have been suggested. I have never seen either of
them on a TV screen.

Have you some other suggestions? Could we discuss this again
soon.

With best wishes,

Sincerely yours,
