Dear Dr, Glaser:

A number of us looked over your report on
electronic computers. We have found it most interesting
and agree in general with your recommendations. I enclose
an extra page with some detailed comments which you may
find helpful. Under separate cover I am also sending vou
& copy of the first report of our Computation Center here.
You may be interested in our plans as outlined in the first
part of this report, particularly those connected with the
soclal sciences.

I will be glad to see you when you get up this
way. I hope your visit will not be in July for I will be
out of town then. However, if you do come in July, please
get in touch with Professor Arden or Dr. Corbato at the
Center, explain who Jou are and come on down anyway .

Sincerely,

Philip M., Morse

Comments on Electronic Computers and Research in the Social
Sciences by Ezra Glaser,

Page 21.

End of first paragraph. Not valid to say "more useful
in control system". All scientific calculations useful.

Under 'key prineiple (2)'. Should follow up speed
description by reason: so that we can do very complex
problems in a finite time.

Under Bl. Not freedom from error but replacing random
by systematic errors which are easier to find and remove.

Answer to question at end of first paragraph. Probably
need a full sketch of modern compute®s at beginning,
with repeated emphasis of important aspects at pertinent
points.

Under 3. Doubt that too much computer work will be done.
At the moment the major hurdle is getting social scientists

to really find out what machines are and can do by practical
experience. Then will come the good, new ideas.

Paragraph 2. Grosch is wrong. The M.I.T. approach and
Forrester's 1s best for the initial educational break-
through. (By the way, Forrester is no longer at Lincoln.

He 1s now at M.I.T.'s School of Industrial Management, as
a Professor.
