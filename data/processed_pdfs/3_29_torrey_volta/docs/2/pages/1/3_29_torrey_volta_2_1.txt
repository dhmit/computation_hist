Dear Professor Carr:

Professor Philip Morse has suggested that I write to you about
the proposal that a series of educational televigion programs be
produced at M.I,T. about computers. The idea has been discussed
from time to time for more than a year, but no firm, detailed plan

Of this sum, $80, 000 would be allotted to WGBH for production
costs, and $20, 000 to M.1.T. for the services of an authority who
would serve as moderator and assume responsibility for the content
of the programs, for honorariums to his guests, and for art work,
props, writing assistance, etc.

The series as then eavisioned would review the rapid development
of high-speed computers, with particular emphasis on the digital
machines, introduce viewers to the operations of such machines, and
point out both their limitations and potentialities. It would cover
various uses of the computers both in industry and science, some
aspects of information theory and cybernetics, and stress both
