Dr. Alan T, Waterman

pProjects that are stili doing pretty well and I supervised the
doctors, masters or bachelors Cheses of six present members of the
National Academy, cne of them a Nobel prize winner. I need some

money to start another good thing." But I know this sort of request
would never get through any of the slots. |

A present my application iz in the slot marked “!hthe-atica.
Research, Computing facilities," This is evidently a bad slot:
Mathematics doesn't get mueh money, educatlon is more popular than
research and computing facilities got no grants this year at all,

80 I hear. And, anyway, no pure mathematician will admit we do
mathematics with a computing machine, So how can computing machines
get anything from such a slot?

Should I try one of your other slots? I¢ 80, which one?
Would 1t help any if you or some of your assistants (not Jjust the
mathematiciansl) came up to see what welre doing or if I come down?
1 really do need adviece, Can you help?

Yours,

Philip M, Morse
