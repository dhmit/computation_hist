Reference: Contract NScri—06001 > DIG-#6345, #6915

Under the proposed plan submitted herewith, Project
#63b5 (Whirlwind Operation) would terminate on June 30, 195?.
The task order for this period would include the usual Whirlwind

proJect activities:

1. Research in methods of numerical analysis and
the formulation of scientific problems for machine
solution. together with the training of personnel
in these methods°

2. support of the Scientific and Engineering Applica-
tions Group of Project Whirlwind so as to make the
computer useful and available for the above-mentioned

research.

In addition, it is proposed that the following task
order arising in connection with the Type 70% EDPM be included:

3. The development of a suitable interpretive program
and associated coding techniques to permit effective
implementation of the Type 7ou machine.

It is anticipated that a separate project will be set
up to handle the Type 704 utilization within the MIT Computation
Center, and a separate request to the ONE for support of this work
will be made in the near future. In this respect certain
experienced programmers could be made available for transfer to
this new task as of January lI 1957a This anticipated transfer
has been taken into account in the budget proposed for Project #63h5.

The foregoing proposal does not take into consideration
termination costs which may be associated with the close out of
this contract and the poesible disposition of the Whirlwind Computer.
It is proposed to delay the submittal of any budget for this matter
until such time as disposition of the Whirlwind Computer is

determined.

The estimated budget for the period July 1, 1956 to
June 30, 1957 is attached herewith as page 3,
