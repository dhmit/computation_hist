system, have built-in input and output subprograms, allow

macros, have good debugging features and always allow to the

  
    

user symbolic references to his program. The resultant system,

  
 

called S0S, was magnificently ambitilous, sufficiently so, that

the system is Jjust beginning to assume complete and debugged

  
   
  
 

form over a year after the first 709 was delivered. Many

    

features of S0S are admirable; however, it is the consensus

  
 

of opinion at the Center that two serious liabilities have

  
 

arisen:

   

1. The improvement in problem formulation
technique by means of compilers is improving
rapidly. Programming in overly-detailed
machine language with no provision for compilers
is not only an accident-prone procedure but
requires one to be a machine-language specialist.

      
 
    
  
   
   
  
  
   
  
 
   

2. The very elaborateness of the SOS system which
has pleased the expert programmers, has dis-
couraged the development of brief, concilse
programming manuals which are also self-contained.

In spite of these objections, the Center plans to have the SOS

system avallable and be prepared to operate it for those who

feel it is a more effective system for their needs. The
programmer who intends to use this system will find it helpful
to familarize himself with the following material in the Center

Document Room.
