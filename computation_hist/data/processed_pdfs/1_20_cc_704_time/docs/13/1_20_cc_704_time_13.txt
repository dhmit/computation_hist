Memorandum To: Professor 0.3. Brown
From: Dr. A.L. Loeh

Subject: Appointment of PJI. Museum to the 1.3.8.8. 7007 Project
to Apply the 11m 70!. to the Problem of Electrophoresis

Date: 19 October 1956

kl. Vienna is a graduate student in Professor J. Th. 6. Overbeek's
Laboratory at the University of Utrecht, working on the phenomenon of
colloid eleetrophoresis. The first phase of the computations will be
completed by the end of 1956, having been programmed and coded for. and run
on the mu computer in Amsterdam, part1 ally under the supervision of
LL. Loch. The subsequent phase or the calculations requires a machine
considerably more sophisticated then the ARM. and it is proposed that
the IBM 704. to be installed at 11.1.15. be applied to the problem

Viersena will take his Doctor's qualifying examinations in
December 1956. and will continue on the electrophoresis problem for his
doctoral thesis with Professor Overbeek, who has enthusiastically endorsed
Wiemema's spending a year at M.I.‘1‘. to acquaint himself with the IBM '70].
computer. Professor Horse has indicated that computer time will he reads
available for the project. Since ﬂier-sens does not need academic credits
from H.145. a straight D.S.R. appoint-at would appear most logical.
Lincoln Personnel has not offered any objection to having a foreign
citieen on 0.5.8. 7007 as long as the work is performed outside the
Lincoln Laboratory. LL. Loch is very glad to supervise and participate
in this research, which is of great fundamental interest. and recomends
Vial-sens as a very capable and conscientious worker.
