special cecding courses which are given by the Center staff during
cach term and summer, A number of other colleges bring some of
their classes in for one or more laboratory sessions, Class use
will expand further, but its expansion will be harpered by the
linitations of access Lo the 704, as will be discunrsed later,

The use of the machine by the other celleges has expanded
rapidly until nearly a full shift is now occupied with their work
(including their class exercises). But this use tenis to be self-
liniting for, as scon as a college faculty begins fully to apprec-
iate the possiblilities in education and research of ccwputers, the
pressure builds up for a machine of their own on their own campus,

By now at least eigh® of the cooperating institutions hxve pachines /) -
of their own. These are smaller machines, of the 650 tngt*gg‘ p«bad;ﬂ
these instituions still come to the Center to use the 704 for their
‘bigzer jobs; but it does mean that the use of the Center iy the :

other Hew fngland colleges will tend to level off to a resiwonable

load (about one shift, it now appears) rather than growing sontin-

uously, as the HUIT usage is doing. This result, of course, jis in

accord with our conviction that computers should be as preva'.ant

as chemistry laboratories. '

In contrast, the LIT use of the 704 for research into isw
applications has grown so that now we are noct able to satisfy .11
requests for ma e
calculations of the'"production-run" type (important as these often
are) even when we encroach on the third nmachine shift, which
has heretcfore been reserved for IBL use., In addition to the
research in solid-state theory, in meteorology and oceanography,
which now depend completely on machine conputation and could

re time thalt we can aliot them, There are a number
ojects which are basic to the development of new
fo cmputers and, indeed, to the developmnent of computers
themselves, which are already handicapped by shortage of machine
ime and limitvation of 704 capacities. To mention a few:
