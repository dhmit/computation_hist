Dear Professor Slater:

1 am enclosing a copy of the Purchase Agreement for an
IBM 709 Computer for your Laboratory under IBM's special educational
program. This plan makes the 709 System available to M.L.T. at a
special purchase price of $461, 800. 1 am also enclosing summaries of
the Maintenance charges and the installment Payments Flan whereby
payments may be made monthly over five years.

 

Since these 709's will be granted on an "as available" basis it
is important that a system be assigned for M.I.T. as soon as possible.
This can be done as soon as we receive the four signed copies of the
| Agreement. As Â£00n as the appropriate IBM signatures have been added,
| one of the copies will be returned to you for your file.

IBM is indeed pleased that we can make thie offer to you. We
know of the need for such a system in addition to the 709 at the
Computation Center, and we are looking forward to seeing your center
grow in importance and influence, especially in your own field of

 

regearch.
Sincerely yours,
