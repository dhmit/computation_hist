Suggestions to memorandum re replacement of 704

page 1, par. 1, line 10: from "computing machines," to
"computing machines effectively, .." (Teager)

line 12: instead of "familiar with" use

" able to exploit..." (Teager)

page 2, last line: change ‘i... linking" to :
",.linking segment subprogram" (Corbato)

page 3, end of second par. Insert (Teager)

". The advantage of such a technique is

that it opens up the very vast, and unexplored,
area of man-machine partnernship in communication
and decision in real time, without any penalty in

machine efficiency or capability. These techniques

will, by making a computer far more accessible and
communicative, not only open up new research areas

as indicated below, but in addition, will sub-
stantially improve the process of producing and
Sim A computer programs."

"_ .The ultimate goal is to make the fastest
and most sophisticated computer as accessible and

(Corbato)

convenient to a person debugging a program as, Say,

a telephone booth would be. This revolutionary

change from present-day operational technique will

greatly enhance the attractiveness of large computers
since many programs will be debugged and run in only

a few days or weeks instead of the typical months
required now."

page 3, par 3, line 2: instead of .."grading examinations ands:

change to read "...grading examingfions, scheduling
classrooms, classes, and students, and”

page 4, par 2, line 14: to read "..and ancillary equipment. ."

General comment by Teager:

Well put - I would only add one point: - 1t may well turn
out. to be necessary to make minor modifications to the T7090

itself. Should the groundwork for this be laid at this point?

We, of course, would do whatever engineering was necessary,
