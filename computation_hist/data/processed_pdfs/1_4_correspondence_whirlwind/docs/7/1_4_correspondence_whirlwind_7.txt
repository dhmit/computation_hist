Subjest: Whirlwind Computer - Use charges.
Dear Sir:

Massacmeetts Institute of Technology letter of December 8, 1954
requested that ONE authorize it to make charges to certain users of the
Whislwind Computer and credit receipts to contract NSori-06001. ONR
letter to V.I.T. dated 24 February 1955 and referenced above accepted
in nrineiple the M.I.T, proposal of December 8, 1954 and requested that
a vorking sgreement be negotiated with ONR Boston. Renresentatives of
M.1.T. and ONR Boston met on March 8B; 1955 and as the result of discussions
M.I.T. now provoses the following sgreement to cover operations of the
Whirlwind Computer.

1. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, operating the
Whirlwind Computer under Contract Noori-06001 is amthorized
to make charges for the use of said commuter in connection
with certain research programs as set forth below.

2. The rates to be charged ave:

(a) On an anmmal basis of guaranteed time ver week, $10,000
per year for ons {1) hour ner week, The minimum for guaranteed
time, on a pro-rata basis, will be $2,500 ner year for 15 mimtes
of comounter time per week.

(b) On an hourly basis. short-term commitments of time will

3. It is recognized that these rates are of necessity being
set arbitrarily due to the lack of operating data. As of this
date, no attempt has been made to senarate out overating,
maintenance, research and develomment costs fram expenditures
under Contract N5ori-06001. Steps will be taken to accumulate
necezgary financial data so that rates may be redetermined at

Subject: Whirlwind Computer - Use charges.
Dear sir:

Massachmsetts Institute of Technology letter of December 8, 1954
requested that ONR authorize it to make charges to certain users of the
Whirlwind Computer and credit receipts to contract HSori-06001, ONR
letter to V.I1I.T. dated 24 February 1955 and referenced above accepted
in principle the M.I.T, proposal of December 8, 1954 and requested that
a working agreement be negotiated with ONR Boston. Renreseantatives of
M.1,T. and ONR Boston met on March 8, 1955 and as the result of discussions
M.I.7. now provoges the following agreement to cover operations of the
Whirlwind Computer.

1. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, operating the
Whirlwind Computer under Contract NSori-06001 is anthoriged
to make charges for the use of said commuter in connection
with certain resegrch programs aes set forth below.

2, The rates to be charged are:

(a) On an anmmal basis of guaranteed time ver week, $10,000
per year for one (1) hour ner week, The minimum for guaranteed
time, on a pro-rata basis, will be $2,500 ver year for 15 mimtes
of comouter time per week,

(b) On an hourly basis, short-term commitments of time will
be at the rate of $250.00 per hour,

Jo It is recognized that these rates are of necessity being
set arbitrarily due to the lack of operating data. As of this
date, no attempt has been made to separate out overating,
maintenance, research and develooment coasts from expenditures
under Contract N5ori-06001. Steps will be talten to accumulate
necessary financial data so that rates may be redetermined at

ea future date and such rates may be clearly substantiated,

Such redetermined rates will anvly vrospectively only. However,


Commanding Officer ec 2 March 25, 1955

in view of charges being made for the use of other large
computers it 1s considered the rates set forth in 2 (a) and
(b) above sre commletely equitable for use until such time
as the necessary cost data becomes available for study and
redetermination of the rates is in order.

4, All nroblems, (5, 7», 8 =nd 9 below), coing on the Whirlwind
Commuter, (except those of the Lincoln Laboratory), will be
avoroved by M.I.T.'s committee on Vachine Methode of Computation.

5. Projects connected with M.I.T.=ONR contracts will not be
charged for use of commuter time.

6o No charges will be made to the Lincoln Laboratory for its
use of the Whirlwind Comvuter.

7. Ae soon as possible tut in no event later than July 1, 1955
all other smonsored M.I.T. research nrograms will pay for use
of the Whirlwind Computer in accordance with the rate schedule
as set forth in 2 (a) and (b) above. It is recogniged that all
such enonsored reséarch projecte may require some months to
obtain appropriations in their budgets for computer time while
it is definitely in the best interests of all concerned to
carry out their nrograms on Whirlwind.

8. Projects undertaken for outside svonsors, including ORR
prime contractors, will pay the established rates for use of
the computer. It is the intention of the Committee on Machine
Computation that such projects be kent at a minimum,

9, It is recognized that the computer will contimme to be used
for research in coding technioues, thesis work, class exercises,
demonstrations and educational projects in accordance with the
philesonhy so fundamental to the continuance of such & contract
as NSori-06001, Cests for such work will be borm directly under
this contract.

10. All exvenses incurred in connection with Whirlwind operations
under 5, 7 and 8 above will be charged against contract N5ori-06001
and 211 monies collected for the use of the computer will be credited
bagk to this contract.

11. ».I.T, will submit monthly fiscal remorts to ONR indicating
the mamber of houre of Whirlwind time which have been charged to
vrojects and the credite which have accrued to Contract NSori-06001.,

12. Regular nroject remorts under Contract N5ori-06001 will contimue
to nrovide information regarding all work carried out on the Whirlwind
Commuter so that ONR will be completely informed concerning the
project activities.

13. It is agreed that all the terms of this sgreement are

subject to review from time to time but as of this date it

is felt that the rate structure should not be redetermined

prior te July 1, 1956 by which time suitable date should be
available for such a study.

14. Since during the nast several months the camputer has
been used for some projects which are vrevared to pay and
which should psy under the terms of the provosed agreement,
it is recommended that 211 of the above terms apply retro-
actively to November 15, 1954.
