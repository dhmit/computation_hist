Dear Volta:

I have had some further discussion with Ed Cohen regarding the
Computer series. Ed's feeling is that this is now something
that mist wait until January 1, 1959 Center money is available.
However, this means that we should supply him with 2 new and/or
revised outline at the earliest possible date and that we should
sign up a man tentatively for nine months to one year beginning
January or February 1959 at once. I believe that we should do
these two things within the next month to six weeks or else
inform the Center that we will be unable to deliver the series.
They would then be free to negotiate with some other institution
since this is something they definitely want.

Sincerely yours,

    

David M. Davis
Assistant General Manager
