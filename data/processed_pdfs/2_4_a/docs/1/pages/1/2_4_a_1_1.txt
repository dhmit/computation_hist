Dear Professor Arden:

Last summer when I was at Endicott at the 1IBM Conference
for Directors of University Computing Centers, 1 was asked to do
some thinking about organiging further meetings of Directors of
these Centers and, in fact, whether it would be appreopriate for
such Directors to organize themselves into a formal or informal
society. I have hesitated for some time as o what action is
appropriate, partly because I am mildly opposed to proliferating
additional societies or conventions and, partly because I have been
extremely busy this year, i1t was, however, suggested that a meeting
of people jnterested in this general field might be arranged either
before or after the ACM meeting here this Â£alll A recent talk with
the local Program Committee for this meeting, however, discouraged
this action and I am somewhat at a loss as to where to go next.
Consequently, I am writing for your advice,

it is perfectly true that the Directors of university
computing centers have problems which are not touched on in the
present ACM meetings or in other computer meetings, They are, of
course, more in the nature of administrative problems, although
these certainly can be real, Whether they could be helped by
having occasional meetings at which these problems can be discussed
or whether they can be taken care of adequately by informal discus-
sion at meetings such as the ACM, I am not sure. it is possible, if
only occasional meetings would be useful, that the National Science
Foundation would be willing to be of financial help. Vhat is needed,
however, is some indication from you who are directing university
computing centers as 1o the need for such a meeting and the possible
agenda, if it is needed, There is to be an Eastern Computer Conference
in Cambridge later in the year, This meeting could be scheduled
near it, if such action scemed appropriate., On the other hand, there
may be advantages in meetings separate from guch large convocations
at some quiet spot where we could talk things over at leisure, Or
of course, we should not meet at all,
