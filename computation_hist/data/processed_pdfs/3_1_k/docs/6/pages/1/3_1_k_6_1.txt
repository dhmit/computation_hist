Prof. Philip M. Morse,

Dear Sir:

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to you for
your hospitality and assistance given to me during my visit to
your office.

Without your help, I am sure, my stay in the States
could not have been so pleasant and fruitful.

The theory and practice of the data processing which I
learned in your country will be the major subject of my study
program in the future. It is my hope that I can further my study
in this field and contribute to the improvement of productivity
of Japanese industry. In order to increase the productivity of
our industry, however, we have many difficult problems to be
solved. It is badly needed for me to obtain detail information
concerning the date processing system in your country.

I shall be very grateful if you could help me on this
matter sometime in the future.

Wishing you the very best of health,

Very truly yours ,
