in this atmosphere and with these facilities, there is an

unparalleled opportunity to do important and basic research in
all phases of the use of digital computers in s@ien ce, engineering,
and business. A central research group, supervised by faculty
members and staffed by workers picked from the graduate students
of MIT and other colleges, working closely with persons from the
other colleges, will help ceor;ina e the work of the Center and
wil1 carry on research of their own in machine logic, in tech=-

1iques of machine @@y§v*ati©n9 and in specific applications of

;@hqnm operation to experimental and theoretical problems, thus
appreciably broadening the ranoo of applic@bilisy of computers
in the physical and social imngea and in engineering.
