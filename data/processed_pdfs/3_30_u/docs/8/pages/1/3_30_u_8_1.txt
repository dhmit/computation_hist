Problens Which I ap most interested in are first all connected
with e@lectronic Computer brogramming ang designing, Lately I took
interest in problems of computer application %o business datg
Processing,

I was born in Warsaw, 1923, In 1948 I graduateq from the
Gdansk /Dantzig/ Technical Uhiversity, Department of Electronicsg.
While studyi I was 8ppointed ag assistant ipn mathematigs at the

: T L 0
I am Directorp of the Institute of’Mathematical Machineg of the
Polish Academy of SCiences since 1957 «

I am member Of the Poligh Mathematicg] Society ang the
American Association for Computing Machinery. I also anm dele gate
of Poland %o the Internationg] Federation for Information
Processing IFIP,

In 1949 71 started working at the Mathematicgl Institute,
My first more important WOrk resulted in the genera) design
of th

and it hag worked ti]l] 1960,

In 1956 1 guided g group, the taglk of which wag to construct
the firgt Polish electronic digital computer, The Computer wag
dccomplished in 1958 and Damed XYZ, On its basis the ZAM-2 computer
has been build, now being broduced in Poland,

In 1956 T organized in the Institute of Mathematical Machinesg
Oof the P,ligh Academy of Sciences the first Polish Computation
and Programming Office, using the Xv7 and next the ZAM~2 computer,

In 1988 71 initiated ang Personally conducted work op an
automatic Programming system for Xvy and ZAM-2 Computers, This,
when completeq in 1961, g0t the name "SAKO" and it Was such firgt
system elaborated in the 8ocialistie countries, The SAKO language
is in Dany respects similar o the American FORTRAN-TT.

In 1960~-62 T Pérsonally guided & group designing & semiconducty
Computer for data.procossing - ZAM--41, Simultaneously I conductegd
& group which elaborated gn automatic Programming sygten for ZAM-41,
e optimum Titting of the machine design for the assumeqd Program-
ming systems was the problem T ®specially kept busy with,
