Dear Dr. Pein:

I read your paper on "The Role of the University
in Computers, Data Processing, and Related Flelds" with some
interest and with some dlsagreement in spots.

The organization you mention is not a definite one
yvet but if 1t comes about 1t will be one of directors of
university computing centers. The pro tem secretary is
Professor VWalter F, Preiberger of Brown Unlversity, to whom
I am sending your letter. I suggest you send him a copy of
your paper.

Nelther he nor I could initlate the invitation to
you to come to a meeting of universlty computing center
directors. This would have to be done by the program com=-
mittee after such a meeting has been decided on. Consequently
I am sending copies of this correspondence to Professor
Freiberger with the suggestion that he flile them for appro-
priate action at a later date.

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse
Director

PMM: LWH
ce: Prof. Frelberger
