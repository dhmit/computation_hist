amspoﬂe vertex of which lies at the origin and the other three verticcs of which
lie on the curve i Z [a + l r l” = 1, Turning his attention to theiinscnbed paral—
lelograms, Minkowski ﬁrst conjectured, in effect, that the minimum and mum-
mam areas would occur at the symmetric positions, 1.e., when the parallelogram
has a vertex on the E - (or 77 -) axis or on the line 5‘: 7, (orE = — n). We
shall prove thjs conjecture to be false, (see 4), for certain small ranges of p and
to be true, (see 5), for suﬂiciently large values of p. Minkowski went on to make
the second conjecture that the minimum parallelogram will have a vertex on the
lineE = 1; (ME = — 1]) when p > 2, while it will have a vertex on the E-(or
17 -) axis when2 > p > 1. Mordell [3] veriﬁed both these conjectures in the case
p = 4, while Davis [1] disproved the second conjecture for values of p sufﬁ-
ciently close to 1 and 2.

We shall also consider the question of when the symmetric parallelogram
provide relative maxima and minima, since this matter has bearing on the con-
jectures when p is not large, and, in particular, it provides our proof that the
optima (and the critical lattices associated with them) do not necessarily pm-
take 0f the ObVlOUS symmetn'es of the metric. This, of course, contradicts Min-
kowski’s ﬁrst conjecture. Our main result, however, is a proof of Minkowski’s
ﬁrst and second conjectures when p is sufﬁciently large.’

2. Formulation of the problem

We describe the family 0f inscribed parallelograms as follows: We use the
:unetnes of the problem so that the parallelogram will have vertices (En ’71)

Then differentiating, we ﬁnd that, ex

Thus, in principle, all of Minkowski’s Conjectures can be resolved by solving

equations (2) and (3) Simultaneously for a and ‘r as functions of pi We shall
ultimately do this, but only for p sufﬁciently large

In the meantime, we take note of the two s
1:0,:7 = opandr = 7,,,u =1,where

up = (2n _ Din!
7; + 1 = 2(1 — n)".

We ﬁrst vcrify that if the base of the parallelogram is rotated from one of thesc
positions to the other, then each position, within symmetries, uill be assumed by
one of the three vertiees lying on the curve I i l" + j r] l" = 1. In fact, the base clearly
takes all slopes between 0 and 1,, , the opposite vertex takes all slopes between
— up and ~ 1 while the included vertex takes all slopes between up and 1/7,. 3
By symmetry, these slopes cover all values between 0 and 1‘ Hence it is no
fundamental restriction to conﬁne tr to the interval 17,, g 0‘ g 1, (or to make the
Corresponding restriction 0 g r g 1,, . As for the sizc of these intervals, when p
goes from 1 to so, a,, goes from 1 to 2, while 7 goes from t to 0, At the same
time, from simple convexity properties, A,,(a, 7') increases monotonically in p for
ﬁxede and r with A1(7—, a) E %, A20, (7)5 t 3, and Aw(7: U) E 1v for all 5 and 7'

3. Relative sizes of symmetry parallelograms

If We substitute 1' = 0 and -r = 7,, , we obtain the following areas correspond-

Hence A,(0, 5) > A,(1, , 1) for p slightly greater than 1 and for p slightly less
than 2, while, on the other hand, A,(r,, l) > AF(0, up) for p slightly greater
than 2. (This is essentially Davis’ method of disproof of Minkowski’s second
conjecture for p near 1 and 2.) If we let 1) become very large, Ap(0, a,,) > A, (r, ,1),
once again, agreeing with Minkowski’s second conjecture. (Davrs located a
crossing point, where A,(0, e,,) = Ap(r,, , 1) near p = 2.5725.) Hence to prove
bath M tnkowski’s conjectures for 1) large we need only show that no optima occur in
A,(r, IT) for «1 inside the open interval 1 < e < a, , and 1 determined by equation

4. Relative extrema

We digress for a moment to consider whether the symmetric extrema are rela-
tive maxima or minima. This process will reveal inherent complications in the
function A,(1, :7), which will justify our restricting ourselves to 71 large. We
develop the following power series expansions:
