Dear Professor Morse:

A record of the scientific accomplishments assisted by the program
for Mathematical Sciences is a source of pride for the National Science
Foundation and of great importance to its continued effectiveness. For
these reasons the Foundation requests that six reprints of mathematical
papers reporting research supported wholly or partly by your grant. Nor-
mally, support is acknowledged in a footnote. Should this have been omitted,
a note to this effect on the reprint will be helpful.

I take this opportunity to remark that in lieu of reprints, which
may not be available until after the termination of a grant, a short ammual
summary of the research and a final summary will be helpful.

If you have already sent me this material up to date, please ignore
this letter.

Thank you very much for your cooperation.

Sincerely yours,

Tien oF. Wham

Leon W. Cohen
Program Diyector for
Mathematical Sciences
