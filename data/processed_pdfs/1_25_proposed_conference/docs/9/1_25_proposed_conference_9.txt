Dear Professor Morse:

I submit the following comments on the First National
Conference of University Computing Center Directors which
I have just received from Mrs. Drew-Bear.

On page 6, paragraph 1, the statement of the appropriate
academic authority to whom the Director of the Center should
report, as written, does not agree with my recollection of the
resolution voted by membership. As I recall, the statement
of the resolution was to the effect that the Director of the
Center should report to an appropriate academic authority
such as a Vice-President or Provost, whose authority included
all academic areas served by the Computing Center, not to
a department head or an administrative authority such as a
Comptroller. Also, the committee recommendation was not
only to advise on policy and procedure in regard to use of a
lab, but also to serve as Board of Appeals from unsatisfactory
priority assignment etc. by the Director.

Yours truly,

er ee.
D. R. Shreve
