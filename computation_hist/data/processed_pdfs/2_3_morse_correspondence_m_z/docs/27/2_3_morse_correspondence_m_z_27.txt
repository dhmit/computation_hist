Dear Mr. Sage:

One of the Iowa State Technology Conferences » in the month of Mey, will be
the Use of Computers for Problem Solving. The audience will be industrial
executives and engineers, two to three hundred of them, from Iowa and sur-
rounding states.

We would appreciate your suggestions and possible help in arranging the
best possible program,

abreast of new development » that is: the status and possible future of the
technique, its business value and how useful it may become to him. There-
fore, in a two or three-day conference we will take up such things as:

Some history of engineering computation, and an explanation of what com-
puters are now making it possible for the engineer to do.

The range of problems and programming techniques and description of
personnel skills required.

Present equipment - mechanical and electrical. Equipment trends and
expectations.

Justification for computer use. Examples of lower cost, greater profit.

The possible effect of computer use upon a company's research and develop-
ment program and therefore its product line,

Expectations of still wider design horizons through the use of computers.

The value of outside professional service with centralized computer fac-
ilities.

« + + And many examples of problem solving application.
