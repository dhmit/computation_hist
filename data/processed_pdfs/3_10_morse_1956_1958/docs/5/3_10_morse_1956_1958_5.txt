The Card Programmed Calculator (CPC) has been used a total @
of 3708 hours during the period January 1 - Rovember 15, 1954.

(Average = 81 hours per week).

The CPC has been used 629 hours during this period on a "free
time" basis. \ A
All work performed by Statistical Services prsonnel is charged OH
to the customer. £ |

The CPC maintenance, down, and service time during this period
was 346 hours, or about 9% of the available time.

The CPC machine usage charge is $15.00 per hour.

Approximately 50% of the CPC programming is done on a self-
service basis.

A second CPC was inetalled at the Instrumentation Laboratory
(for their own use) on June 1, 1954, and it has since been
used exclusively for their work.

A Type 650 Magnetic Drum Calculator was ordered in December, 19563,
and it is to be delivered to the Instrumentation Laboratory (for
their exclusive use) in June, 1955 unless the Administration
decides otherwise before that time.

B. Whirlwind Project (WWl)

1.

All WWl machine time has been free during the same period
(January 1 - November 15, 1954); however, it has now been
placed on a partial pay-as-you-go plan effective November 15th.

An hourly machine usage rate of $250 per hour has been established.

WWl supervision, administration and some programming service is
still free.

WWl Scientific and Engineering Applications Group consists
of 34 people, representing annual salary cost of $134,000.

Wil users are expected to program their own problems whenever
possible.

A proposed subject in Management Information Systems is to be given in the

School of Industrial Management (8.I.M.) for the first time in the Spring

Term 1955. This subject will illustrate the use of digital computers as a

tool of business managment. A list of related subjects which make occasional

use of the facilities is given in Appendix (page v). Naturally, such participa-
. tion would be materially increased if equipment were available on a gratis basis.
