and business. A central research group, staffed by faculty members
and graduate students of MIT, working closely with persons from
the other colleges, will help coordinate the work of the Center
and will carry on research of their own in machine logic, in tech-
niques of machine computation, and in Specific applications of
machine operation to experimental and theoretical problems, thus
appreciably broadening the range of applicability of computers in
the physical and social Sciences and in engineering.

It is appropriate for government agencies to help support the
research of this central research group. The group's work will,
in part, provide an expanding basis of knowledge of numerical
analysis and programming techniques, which can be used by the other
participants at the Center and will, in part, break ground in new
flelds of mathematical logic and methods of data processing which
will be needed in the application of digital computers to new tasks.

Most of the senior stafr for such a research group 1s already
assembled at the Institute. Part of it is the group which developed
Whirlwind I programming; others are in various departments of the
Institute. From time to time, some of the staff of the participating
colleges would join it for a Semester or a year, on leave from their
institution, to work full-time at the Center. The names of some of
the staff, and their experience, are listed 1in Appendix

IBM and the Institute will contribute about a half million
dollars a year to provlide the equipment, bullding, maintenance, and
operating staff of the Center. We believe that a contribution of
about 100,000 a year will Support the activities of the central
