ACADEMIC COMPUTATIONAL TRAINING PROGRAM

introduction

There are a numbsr of graduate subjects in automatic computation,
aumerical analysis, and now electronic data processing, offered at M.I.T.
The present list of subjects directly related to machine ccmputation includes
the following:

M39 Methods of Applied Mathematics 3 ~ Â© G Hildebrand
M4il Numerical Analysis 3 -2 =17 G Hildebrand
M412 Numerical Analysis 3 -2 -7 G Hildebrand

It is spparent from the above list that these subjecis are predominantly
Graduate A subjects -- which indicates that this subject is primarily forxr
graduate students. However, it is perfectly possiblie for undergraduate

students in their senior year to teke these subjecis as an elective.

Machine-Aided Analzsiq - 6,25

Subject 6.25 ~-- Machine-Aided Analysis -- was cffered for the Zirst
time duving the fall term 1253-1954. This subject differs froe other
ccmputational subjects in the following respecis:
