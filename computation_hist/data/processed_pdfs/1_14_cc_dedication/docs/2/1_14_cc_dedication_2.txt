Program for the Pre-Dedication

House-Warming of the Computation Center
May 24, 1957

Since the wiring of the 704 is not yet completed, the
checker-playing program we had hoped to put on for you will
have to be postponed. The Center quarters will be open for
your inspection between 10.15 a.m. and 12.00, there will be
a stand-up lunch served in the Conference Room on the first
floor at the end of the building at 12.00, and there will be
a discussion of the program of the Center in Room 6-120
(Main Building, East side, first floor) from 1.00 to 3.30.

| From 10.45 to 11.30, in the 704 Room, Frank Verzuh
will describe the equipment. Between 10.15 and 10.45 and
between 11.30 and 12.00 several members of the Center staff
(1ist appended) will be in the TO4 Room, and will be pre-
pared to answer various questions eoncerning the equipment,
procedures for using it and our plans for research. Each
member will be glad to answer general questions, but each
has his own specialty (mentioned in parentheses after his
name) and, if you have specialized questions, we suggest
you look up the appropriate person. Each is wearing a
yellow badge with his name on 1t€.
