Kopal reported that the situation was not yet clear about
Verzuh or Salzer. The Committee felt that Verzuh should teke
139 this term, bub Verzuh hes not yet gotten clear snough of his
various duties to be eble to carry this and teach his course and
teke M39 and do his thesis. Nevertheless the Committee felt 1t
wes better for him to sign up for M39 now and to work toward a
lightening of his duties: if this turns out to be impossible, to
cancel M39 later. It appeers only to welt action by Stratton to
cloor the matter up. In Salzer's cese his supervisory committees
$s meeting today end should cleer up his questions.

Kopel indicated that Professor Gerdner would appreciate
hearing from the Committee as to how he 1s to advise Electrical
Engineering men in this field what to take for their minors.
