Dear Sir:

This letter comes to you by way of a request. Shell Oil Company
Technical Services Division has asked me to carry on certain special

School. In this connection Mr. ReS. Barton of Shell has asked me to
exchange with you, if possible, some ideas on automatic programming,

The field of automatic programming is of some interest to our
group and we have studied several phases of it, including a develop-

and some work on general concepts of intormaiion revrieval. As a
result of this work the shell group has published several papers
and manuals, some of which 1 have for your reference.
I would be Very happy it we could arrange a meeting between you,
or members of your staff, and myself to discuss other developments
in this field. However, my attendance at the Business School necessarily
restricts by day somewhat. So if you apprcve of this suggestion,
may I ask that you write me to that effect and let me telephone you
to arrange the meeting?

lhank you for your courteous attemtion to this matter.

Yours truly,

Robert W., Fri
