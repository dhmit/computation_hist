1 agree with the previous referee in that the material is not
a new development and therefore, that it is questionable, that it should
be published in a research journal, particularly in one which has some
limitation on the number of pages it can afford to publish per year. If
publication of this paper would endanger or even slow up publication of
new research, it should not be published in the Astrophysical Journal.

I disagree with the previous referee in that I feel that the
presence of high-speed computers in a f√©w universities does not cancel
the need for good tables. There is undoubtedly a need, and an important
need, for tables of this sort, but the number of workers who would need
and actually use the tables would be a small fraction of those subscribing
to the Astrophysical Journal,

Of course, the tables would be more than twice as useful if the
second solution were given, as well as the first. Then solutions for ae
shell model could be worked out.

I suggest that this set of tables be published in a photo-offset
edition of several hundred copies and that notices be published in MTAC,
the Astrophysical Journal and other Journals which would reach the
appropriate audience, describing the tables and telling where they may be
obtained.
