pr1> P,(e) by the irrationality of the 6, when k>1. If we let §
= [Zi>ilpdi— pA)21V2/ (Z63)/* denote the distance from the lattice
point (p:) to the line A(8:), then easily 7> 98 (since 7 is the maximum
distance from a point of K*toA(®:)), and 8> [pV/4=V(ga+€) (267) /2],
Therefore using the trivial relationships po= (EpHV22 py and Z6; <d
we find po> [(ga+6) d—14(d=1/ 2pd—1]-1 This gives us a distance that thé
convex body K* can attain without containing an interior lattice
oint other than the origin. Thus it easily follows that Cd = C*=ca
=(g ddll!)——(d—-l). : ~
Even using Very simple methods, we can improve ca somewhat; but
still, on the basis of present information on ga[2, p. 72], we can show
only that as d—», log Ci/(d log d) lies between 1 /2 and —1. At
any rate, the function Calre=% appearing in the main theorem, is
seen to contain the best possible power of .-
