coincide with their predictions, which were based only
on the electrostatic and elastic forces in a purely ionic
model, Verwey and Heilmann’ suggested that the
anomalies could be accounted for by the stability of the
tetrahedral covalent bonds which form about certain
cations when located in tetrahedral interstices.

Romeijn* has suggested that ions with a noble-gas
outer-electron-shell structure, such as Mg*t, A**, and
Ti**, are less compressible than ions with a full or half-
filled d-shell, such as Zn**, Cd**, Ga’®*, In®*+, Ge*t, Snt,
Mn**, and Fe**, so that the latter group is more easily
accommodated in tetrahedral sites than is the former.
It is not obvious why a full or half-filled d shell should
be more compressible than a noble-gas shell. However,
since the outer electron shells in noble-gas structures
are separated from the next higher energy levels by a
considerable energy gap, they do not provide empty
orbitals for the formation of covalent bonds. In transi-
tion metals the nd and (n4-1)s orbitals differ very little
in energy. Covalent bonds are therefore easily formed,
and since covalent bonds involve orbital overlap, they
are shorter than electrovalent bonds. Therefore the ions
with outer d shell appear more compressible than those
with outer noble-gas shell.

Finally Romeijn" and van Santen and van Wier-
ingen'® considered the effect on electronic binding ener-
gies of crystalline fields in ionic crystals of cubic sym-
metry. They stated that the d shell splits in such a field
into two set of orbitals, one extending along the (111)
directions, the other in the (100) directions.'®* Van
Santen and van Wieringen assumed that the former is
more stable when the outer electron configuration of the
cation is @ or d® (as in Mn**, Cr**, and Ni?t), but that

the latter is more stable for the configuration @® or d7 (as
in V3 and Co?). An ion with a stable (111) electron
configuration would, according to van Santen and van
Wieringen’s express assumption of electrovalent bond-
ing, fit more easily into an octahedral site where the
electron charges of the cation can fit between the
directed anion p orbitals without appreciable overlap.
An ion with a stable (100) electron configuration would
fit more easily into a tetrahedral site for an analogous
reason.

The assumption regarding the relative stabilities of
the d-shell bonds has never been substantiated. What is
more important, however, is that the result of the over-
lapping of the filled oxygen p orbitals with the empty
cation orbitals has been ignored. Such an overlap gives
rise to coordinate covalence which reduces the polarity
of the cation-anion bond, stabilizes the system, and
reduces the effective anion radius. The influence of
electrostatic and elastic energies on cation ordering is
reduced. It will be shown below that if covalent con-
siderations are used to supplement and modify the
electrostatic and geometric considerations of the purely
ionic model, the cation distributions in the spinel
lattice can be readily accounted for without recourse
to an assumption either with regard to the d-shell
splitting of various atoms or to the compressibility of
the d shell.

The cation distribution in a crystal is determined by
its minimum free energy A=E—TS, where 7T is its
absolute temperature, S is its entropy, and E, its
internal energy, is the sum of an electrostatic contri-
bution E;, an elastic (Born-repulsion) contribution E,,
and an electronic-bonding and exchange contribution
E,. In the spinel lattice, covalence effects E;, E,, and E,.
In the absence of covalence E, approximately equals
zero. Covalent bonding makes E, appreciably negative

and, by decreasing the ionic charge and bond length,
alters the influence of E; and E,. Since disorder corres-
ponds to high entropy and the entropy contribution
(TS) increases with temperature, high temperatures
tend to disturb ordering.

III. COVALENT BONDS
A. Introduction

It was pointed out in Sec. ITA, above, that spinels
are an ordered mixture of the zinc-blende and rock-salt
structures. It is expected that those metals whose oxides
form the zinc-blende structure tend to occupy tetra-
hedral sites in spinels as they do in the oxides. Similarly
metals whose oxides are of the rock-salt type tend to
occupy octahedral sites. Frequently the relative stabili-
ties of the two metals in a given interstice in the spinels
must be compared before an actual prediction about
their distribution over the two types of sites can be
made.

The zinc-blende interionic bond is predominantly
covalent if the cation is large. Purely ionic forces would
place the cation in the interstices with the largest anion
coordination, viz., the octahedral position. The metals
whose oxides have the zinc-blende structure are there-
fore expected to be covalently bound to tetrahedral
sites when in a spinel lattice.

The octahedrally coordinated cations of the rock-salt
structure may be either electrovalently or covalently
bound to their near-neighbor anions. The relative
strength with which a metal, whose simple oxide has the
rock-salt structure, is held to an octahedral interstice
in the spinel lattice depends upon the relative charge,
size, and covalent-bonding of the competing cations.
Cations which are more stable in octahedral sites in the
simple oxides tend to go into octahedral sites, but may
be forced into tetrahedral sites in the spinel lattice.
Therefore both electrovalence and covalence may be
found in each type of interstice. To distinguish between
electrovalence and covalence, the valence of the former
is written in Arabic numerals (e.g., Mg**), of the latter,
in Roman numerals (e.g., Zn'!),

In spinel crystals the coordination of the close-
packed-anion interstices limits the possible cation-
anion bond types which can be formed. If the stable
covalent-bond types which any cation forms can be
independently determined, the anion interstices in
which the steric constraints are compatible with stable
covalent-bond formation are known. Measurements of
the steric structure of complex ions containing a particu-
lar cation provide the necessary independent information
since the complex-ion structure is primarily deter-
mined by the stable covalent-bond formation. Complex-
ion structure is only secondarily effected by steric
hindrance and the difference in the electronegativities of
the components. The steric structure of complex 1ons
can be determined by optical and by magnetic-sus-

ceptibility measurements.!” Thus a knowledge of com-
plex-ion structure gives information about both the
relative stabilities of a cation in octahedral vs tetra-
hedral coordination and the possible distortion of the
steric constraints.

If covalent bonds are formed in the spinel lattice,
both bonding electrons come from the anion, and the
bond is coordinate-covalent. The near-neighbor anions
perturb the cations so that they form stable, empty
hybrid orbitals which overlap with the anion p orbitals.
If the empty orbitals have energies which are nearly
degenerate with the outermost filled orbitals, if the
electronegativity difference between the ions is not too
great, and if the orbital overlap is large, the empty
cation orbitals interact with the full anion p orbitals to
accept electrons from the anions. Then the anion p
electrons are induced to share their time between the
cation and the anion. If empty orbitals are not available
for hybridization, half-filled orbitals can participate in
covalence. However, filled cation orbitals obviously do
not participate in covalent-bond formation.

B. The Oxygen Orbitals

The oxygen ion has the structure 1525?2p%. The p
orbitals are three mutually perpendicular dumbbells.
In oxides with the spinel lattice each oxygen has four
near-neighbor cations, of which three are in octa-
hedral sites and the fourth is in a tetrahedral site. The
three octahedral sites are situated along three mutually
perpendicular directions from the oxygen; the tetra-
hedral site lies in the (111) direction away from the
quadrant defined by the three octahedral sites. The
oxygen can bond covalently with any or all of the
octahedral-cation neighbors through its three p orbitals.
In this case, however, there are no anion orbitals
directed toward the tetrahedral site, and the tetra-
hedral-site cation-oxygen bond is ionic.

If the bond toward the tetrahedral site is covalent,
the overlap of full oxygen orbitals with the empty
orbitals of the octahedral-site cations is reduced since
the oxygen p orbitals no longer point directly towards
the cations. This reduction in orbital overlap reduces
the strength of any covalent bonding in the octahedral
sites.

Thus there is competition between the tetrahedral
and octahedral sites for overlap with the full oxygen p
orbitals. Unless strong covalence can occur simul-
taneously in both types of sites, there will be covalent
bonding in, at most, one type of site only. If stable
covalent bonds can be formed in both types of sites at
once, hybrid (sp*) orbitals, which point toward the four
corners of a tetrahedron, may be admixed with the p°
orbitals on the oxygen ion. Such orbitals do not overlap
as much with the octahedral-cation orbitals as do the
pure p* orbitals, and the strength of the octahedral-site
