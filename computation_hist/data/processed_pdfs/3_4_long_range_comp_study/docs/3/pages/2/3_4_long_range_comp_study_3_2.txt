CATIONS FOR A MULTIPROGRAMMING PACKAGE FOR THE 2020 SYSTEM

SPECIFI

 

This feature performs two {2) relatively independent functions
for the 7090 which are required for efficient multiprogramming
or timeasharing of the systemo They are: automatic relocation
and variable bounds memory protection. Both functions are
provided without extending the execution time of any 7090

instructiono

lg AUTOMATIC RELOCATION

A seven bit register (relocation register) is provided.
When in the relocation mode; these seven hits are added
to the high order 7 bits of all memory addresses,
including “1“ cycles” generated by the CPU. A program»
therefore, written to execute in a particular set of
storage locations can be moved along with its data to any
other location (the increment of course being a power or

256) and executed there,
Two instructions are provided:
1) Set Relocation Mode E

Execution of this instruction will glaee hits 21=2?

of Y into the relocation register and enter the
relocation modeo The instruction is indexable and
indirectly addressableo Relocation will not take

place until the instruction following the SRM has been
exeoutedv Alsog no l/O traps can oa.ur between SRM and
the instruction followinga * Execution of any trap
militake the CPU out of the relocation modea if the
CPU is in the relocation mode; a) all traps will inhibit
1/0 traps until restored or enable anﬁ b) execution
of the interval timer twaps (RPQ E8 “F will store a
“1“ in position 1? of looation 6.
