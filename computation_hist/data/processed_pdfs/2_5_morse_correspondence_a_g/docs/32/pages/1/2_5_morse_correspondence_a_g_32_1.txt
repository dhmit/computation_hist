Dear Dr. Glaser:

A number of us looked over your report on
electronic computers. We have found it most interesting
and agree in general with your recommendations. I enclose
an extra page ,with some detailed comments which you may
find helpful. Under separate cover I am also sending you
a copy of the first report of our Computation Center here.
You may be interested in our plans as outlined in the first
part of this report, particularly those connected with the
social sciences.

I will be glad to see you when you get up this
way. I hope your visit will not be in July for I will be
out of town then. However, if you do come in July, please
get in touch with Professor Arden or Dr. Corbato at the
Center, explain who you are and come on down anyway.

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse
