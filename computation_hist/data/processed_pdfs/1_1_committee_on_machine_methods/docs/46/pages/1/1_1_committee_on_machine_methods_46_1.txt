From: Professor P. H. Horse, Chairman, Institute Committee
on Machine Computation and Nmerical Analysis

Subaect: Proposed Conference on Mathematical Tables

1. With the reduction or the activities or the
Bureau of standards in the Merical Analysis field, there
is left no organization with the responsibility of seeing
that numerical tables of new and useful functions, needed
in research and engineering, are computed, printed in a sat-
isfactory torn and made available to the persons and organi-
zations needing them. The need is not for another large
organization, but some central group for planning and coordi-
nation, vith some funds available to finance editing and

such tables are less needed; there are new ways or making
tebles,and it may be that tables should be produced in a

 

3. Consequently, there is an urgent need to call
together a small group of persons interested in tables of
functions, both producers and users, to consider these and
other questions and to make recommendations to some national

s. The National Science Foundation has evidenced
an interest in this field and has invited a proposal for

such a conference and a request that the NSF provide the
conference financing.

5. Accordingly, it is proposed that the Institute
suggest to the Science Foundation that there be organized a

I

be held at the Institute sometime this summer, to be Jointly
sponsored by the Foundation and the Institute and to be
financed by the Foundation. This should be a working Con-
ference and as such should number not more than 25 members,
chosen from those mathematicians, computers, academic and
industrial scientists who are actively interested in tables
of functions, either as producers or users. The tentative
