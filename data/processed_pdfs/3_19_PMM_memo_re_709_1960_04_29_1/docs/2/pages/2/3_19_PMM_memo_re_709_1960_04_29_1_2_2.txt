the communication gap between man and machine.

Of no less importance are questions of internal schedul-
ing of the computer among many users, and the development of
programming systems to implement the scheduling, access,
translation and running of the many diverse user programs.

The ground work for the proposed research ls well es-
tablished at the M.I.T. Computation Center, which has already
had experience in developing prototype techniques for an IBM
704 system.

It 1é expected that a grant of approximately $51,000 for
the first year and §$76,000 for the second year will be suffi-
cient for the manpower requlirement for research and develop-
ment of a feasible system utilizing an IBM 7090 computer.
Such funding will cover the development of prototype equip-
ment, not the installation of the full scale system.

Background

The normal mode of computer usage, particularly with the
larger installations, has been to physically separate the ma-
chinery from the man who intends to use 1t; the researcher is
kept from the research tool; the programmer from the running
ofhis program. In the past this has made good sense. After
all, a computer's time can be quilte expensive, and if there are
a large number of people who need 1ts services, then 1t can
serve them far more efficiently 1f they state clearly exactly
what they want in advance, and their requests (programs) are
put in with a batch of similar requests to be serviced at the
earliest moment. Further, there seemed to be no compelling |
reason why the user should need to get any closer to the equip-
ment. For that matter even i1f the need could be proved, there
was no feasible way to allow him (plus many others like him)
to have such an immediate access and association wlthout a
hopeless loss in efficiency of the computational system.
