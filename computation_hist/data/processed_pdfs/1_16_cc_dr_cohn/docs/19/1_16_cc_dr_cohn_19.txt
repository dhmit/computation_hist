NOTE ON ALMOST-ALGEBRAIC NUMBERS

1. Introduction. According to a theorem, of J. Liouville,2 if 9 is
an algebraic number of degree n, then any approximation by ra—
tionals, p/q, is of such‘a nature that

for a positive constant k. Liouville constructed his transcendental
numbers as the limit of special sequences of rationals, p/g, which
violated condition (1) regardless of the values of k and n, as q—Nn.
Thus Liouville constructed almost-rational numbers.

E. Maillet3 likewise found a lower bound for 9—11 where now 9 is
approximated by the quadratic numbers, a. He then violated his
lower bound by substituting for 0 the value of an almost periodic
simple continued fraction and for a a quadratic number, namely a
periodic simple continued fraction that 9 almost represented. Thus
he constructed an almost-quadratic transcendental.

It is an elementary matter to ﬁnd a lower bound for 0—01, where
we now approximate 6 by an algebraic number not necessarily ra-
tional or quadratic. We could then try several departures. We could,
for example, try to construct almost-cubic or almost-biquadratic
transcendentals.‘ On the other hand, we could use a diagonal method,
that is, we could consider the limit of a rapidly converging sequence
of algebraic numbers whose degree becomes indeﬁnite. For example,
a root of a power series with rational coefﬁcients is the limit of a se-
quence of (algebraic) roots of the partial sums, and the speed of con-
vergence is regulated by the remainder. If the remainder is too small
we ﬁnd that the root of our power series can be approximated too
closely by algebraic numbers of varying degrees, namely the roots of

‘ For instance, E. Maillet, op. cit., pp. 22, 100, considers certain “rapidly converg-
ing” power series with rational coeﬁﬁcients and algebraic values of the argument. The
value of such a series is shown to be almost algebraic when regarded as the limit of the
algebraic partial sums (which lie in the ﬁeld generated by the argument and therefore
are of no higher degree than the argument).

dental By this method we can obtain some transcendental numbers

which seem to have previously escaped notice.

To see this, let or take the algebraic value 6 of degree n within a
circle of convergence of radius p. We suppose E(a) to be an arbitrary
polynomial of degree I: with integral coefﬁcients of which the greatest

Furthermore, since E(o') has only a limited number of roots,
E(cr;.(9)) can not vanish for all h. For, when h changes to h+1, (7;.(0)
changes by aMitJ‘H‘, which approaches zero ash approaches inﬁnity,
although this term never vanishes, 0:0 having been excluded. Thus
