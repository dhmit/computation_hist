Dear Phil,

Your letter of January 14th was very welcome. 1t was nice to hear
from you after such a long time, and I appreciate the problems which you
are now facinsg with regard to wroiraamers for your Center. Unfortunately
none of the atudents who are likely to graduate with me this year would
be suitable for your purpose, 2as they do nothave sufficient machine

experisnce. T ghould, however, like to call your attention, in this

connection, to Dr. T. W. Olle, a former student of mine (PheDe Manchesler,
1957 ) whoage 1ain intere:ts are in machine computztions, and who since his
praduatiog has been employed by tiie SHAPE ‘o:putin Canter at the Hague on
exactl; the sa.e work as you have in 'aind. I can recommnend him to you very
w.rmly as : competent and energetic young wman, fully versed in hias trade.
Unfortunete!y he is nrot movable immnediately: dbut shonld you be interested

I ghould b2 ~lad to reconmend 4o him that it may be in his interest to

Joln you 1fxrol {sa;'a next autumne
