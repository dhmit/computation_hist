Electrical Engineering g!g_, REAC

The operational statistics pertaining to the E. E. REAC located
in Bldg. 32 were obtained from Mr. George Newton, and they represent the
activities based on 9-months of operation. (The computer was installed in
June, 1953). Since this REAC is used largely by students on a Self-Service
basis, and no operating staff are provided, the resulting annual operating
costs are fantastically low ($1600). Admittedly, the computer is still new
and meintenance costs have not assumed their steady-state value.

Instrumentation Laboratory REAC

The operational statistics pertaining to the REAC located in the
Whittemore Bldg. were obtained from Mr. H. Laning, and they represent the
activities for a typical year of operation. (This REAC was installed in
1950, hence maintenance costs now are quite reslistic -- $12,000 per year).
This REAC is used by various members of the staff of the Instrumentation
Laboratory in a classified area. Since the actual number and type of
operators varies from month-to-month, no attempt was made to include their
salaries in the operating costs. Two part-time engineers are available to
maintain end assist the users in the operation of this computer.

Instrumentation Laboratorz Bigh-Sggod Simulator

There are 4 engineers and 3 technicians associated with the opera-
tion and development of new components for this computer. Since this equip-
ment is a special-purpose device, it requires skilled operators, and the
attendant operating cost is $60,000 per year. This computer 1is used effectively
as a tool for the study of certain types of system-control problems.

Instrumentation Laboratory Desk Congutigg Group

There are approximately 18 persons engaged in the operation of
conventional Friden, Marchant, and Monroe calculators in various groups at
the Instrumentation Laboratory. Incidentally, the size of this group hes
been reduced from the previous number of 28 to the present size of 18 by
the self-service utilisation of the Card Programmed Calculator located in
the M.X.T. Office of Statistical Services. The cost of operating the present
staff of 18 persons is $45,000 per year.

Rockefeller Differential Analyzer (RDA)

The RDA has been subsidized by the Instrumentation Laboratory
since October 30, 1950 and is used almost exclusively for this group.
There are 4 full-time personnel associated with the maintenance and operation
of RDA. Imn addition to the operation of the computer, a limited amount of
development work has been performed. Specifically, a Vector Unit has been
completed and inshlled during the past year. This device will permit the
solution of more complicated 3-dimensional pursuit problems.
