It is the desire of the Covernment and the Contractor that eddi-

tional research on an electronic digital computer and contimued component -
research be performed, and that the scope of the work be expanded :
to include theoretical studies and experimental research and development in |
ccnnection with the spplication of the digital computer in an air defénse
system in which information is transwitied from remote radar stations

and processed by a computer, and the epplication of the computer to
izportant sclentific problems. To accomplish thés, there are hereby
provided an expansion in the scope of work, an extension in the period

of performance and an incresse in the estimated cost of Task Order I
underContractHSoﬂ.-&.

i October 1945, revised 20 March 1946,° and to include (1) investi-
sgations invoiving electric circuits, video amplifiers, electrostatic
storage tubes, electyonic switching, mathematical solution; (i1) the
design and construction of a Digital Computer and the studies for
applying the computer to an Aircraft Anslywer besed on results ob-
tained from the foregoing; aend (iii) shall furnish complete sets of
drawings used in the construction of the above compulers, reports
setting forth the demign and operation of all components of the
computers, reports setting forth the resulis of studies of the
application of the computer to an aircraft analyzer, and records of
results of all tests on individusl components and assembled compon-
entes conducted wp to 15 November 19503

(2) theoretical studies and experimental research and development
in connection with the epplication of digital computers in an alr
defense system in which informetion ie transmitted to WHIRLWIND from
remote radar stations and processed by the computer, and

{3) epplicaticn of the computer to importent scientific problems.”
5., On and after 1 July 1950, section (B) shall read as follows:

It is understood and agreed that, although section (A) §1) refers to
four (4) phases of the work in comnection with the WHIRLWIND Project
no provision has been made in the estimated cost to cover the thind
and fourth phases of the work which relate to the construction,
assembly, housing, operation or preliminary testing of the Electronic
Computer and Alrcraft Anslyzer,”
