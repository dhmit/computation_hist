Thus far, management education and
management practice have been com-
partmentalized into such classic
subdivisions as finance, marketing, pro-
duction, and accounting. However, the
major problems of the industrial manager
arise not so much from the separate
components of the company as from how
these interact to produce instability in
prices, production, employment, and
profits. Building on the development of
electronic computers, on military advances
in understanding decision-making and in
using simulation to solve complex sys-
tems, and on twenty years of research-in
feedback control systems, we may now
develop new ways to analyze the indus-
trial enterprise. Management is on the
verge of a major breakthrough in under-
standing how industrial company success
depends on the interaction between
flows of information (including policies
and decisions), materials, money, man-
power, and capital equipment. To help
provide a basis from which to understand
the forces causing industrial fluctuation,
growth, stability, and decline, the Mas-
sachusetts Institute of Technology
School of Industrial Management will
offer a two-week Special Summer
Program on Industrial Dynamics from
Monday, August 17, through Friday,
August 28, 1959.

 

Outline of Program

This Special Summer Program will
describe new methods of analyzing how
organizational structure, policies, deqsnon
criteria, information distortion, and time
lags in information and material flow
may affect the course of industrial
growth, cause fluctuation in sales,
accentuate seasonal tendencies, and
amplify external economic conditions.
Models of industrial company operation
will be formulated for digital computer

solution.

This Special Summer Program results
uate teaching in the dynamics of eco-
nomic systems, company functions, and
corporate policies, and in programming
computers for industrial-dynamic analy-
ses. For a more complete description of
this approach and its results, see “Indus-
trial Dynamics—A Major Breakthrough
for Decision-Makers” by Professor Jay
W. Forrester in the July-August, 1958,
issue of The Harvard Business Review.

Staff

This will be an intensive session devoted This Program is under the direction of
to method, rather than a descriptive sur- Dr. Jay W. Forrester, Professor of Indu
vey course. It is intended primarily for the  trial Management. The staff will includ:
executive, to give him sufficient under- John L. Enos, Assistant Professor. and
standing to judge the usefulness of the other members of the industrial '
approach for his own company. The dynamics group of the M.|.T. School
management science specialist or the of Industrial Management.
management school faculty member will

find that the Program provides a basis

for further work; but it is not sufficient

preparation for immediate use of this new

approach to management problems.

Tuition for the two-week Program will be

WVW%SCG'W%MWMWM—N

of admission. Academic credit will not be
offered. Exercises will be held from 9 to
12 and 2 to 5, Mondays through Fridays.

The Program can accept only a limited
number of participants. Applicants must
have a wide interest in and experience
with the problems of the company as a
whole and the interaction of the separate
industrial functions of research, engi-
neering, production, marketing, and
finance. Preference will be given to those
who have had mathematics (through dif-
ferential equations), an introduction to
digital computer programming, and prac-
tical or educational contact with feed-
back control systems. Applications should
show industrial experience and the
extent of training in mathematics, digital
computation, and feedback control.

Programs marked with an
asterisk (") are of one
week's duration; those with
a dagger (1) are of three
weeks’ duration. All other
Programs extend through
two weeks
