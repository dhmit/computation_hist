Dear S1ir:

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology submlts
hepewlth a proposal for extension of the reference coniract to
June 30, 1957 at an additlonal estimsted cost of $20,960.00.

Wwa understand that thils proposgl has been the subject of dlscus-
along between Professor P. M. Morse of MIT and Mr., A. J. Wise

of ONR-MIT, Dr. Carl F. Mukenhaupt of ONR-Bogton, end Dr. P s
Weyl of ONR-Waghlngton. |

There Tollows & summary of expenditures and funds
remaining on the two projects, Whirlwind Operation and Machine
Methods of Computatlon, which are currently actlive under the
reference contracths

Project #6345 (Whirlwind Operation) has an unexpended
balance of $97,000 as of November 30, 1955. The current expend-
1 tures are approximately $10,000 per month, The average "income"
received for Whirlwind usage 18 approximately $3,000 per month --
o net expenditure of $7,000 per month. If 1% is essumed that the
present level of income (83,000 per month) 1s maintained during
the nineteen-month perlod December 1, 1955 to June 30, 1957, a
minimum emount, assumlng some tapering off, of $119,000 wlll be
required during this period. |

Project #6915 (Machine Methods of Computation) has an
unexpended balance of $71,000 as of November 30, 1955. The current
expenditures are approximately $7.000 per month. If 1t assumed
+hat the present expendltiures remain congtant, there will be a
balance of approximately $22,000 on June 30, 1956. In accordance
with our present plens for terminating the ONR support of this
project on June 30, 1956, there will be certaln additional term-
inating expenditures. It 1is estimated that $7,000 will be
expended for termination purposes.

Thig summary is based on eatimates prepared by Prof-
eggsor P. M. Morse.

Professor Morse further advises that the expected
arrivel of an IBM Type 704 Electronlc Data Processing Machine atb
MIT about January 1, 1957 will create a definlte need for addl-
tional funds--to finance the conversion of exlstlng Whirlwind
programg to Type 704 programs.
