Vs " yuu kuuv l am cuncoruoi with the 1notallntion of tko .

- IBM 704 Calculater u( EAM equipment in the llT Computation Cutor. |
On osrlier examination of the nrauincq Aaa etc, concerming this
~area, I had the 1-pron-1.n that we were aoonntically treating the
 walls in this area, However, as a result of recent discussions with
Mr, R C. cclliu, x am concerned abut tho tonntu pontr

g 1) 1 undcrltaad tho vest wall of the 704 lbo- (by tho :

B3 tnpc units) is to be a hard plaster finish, I feel stromgly that

 

ve should place sound ahlorbing material on this wall-~as we have
done here at IH‘ on our last three EAM 1utalution

2) 1 nave oxnlined the sample nprayad aqboaton" which
you recommend for the recessed ceiling in the 704 Room, This material
appears to be suitable from an acoustical standpoint; howavor I am
very concerned about the faet that particles of asbestos will bc
falling into the 704 Room causing malfunotioning of the magnetie tape
unite, As you kmow, we have spent several humdred thousand dollars
putting in air conditioning and filter equipment for the 704, We
cannot therefore allow foreign materi al from the ceiling te cause
tape malfunctiening,

3) I now understand that there is to be no acoustical ma-
terial in the EAM area, and I again am cencerned singe in every eme
of our previeus and present EAM installations, we have found it mest
essential to have acoustical material on the walls,

I understand that there has been some discussion of the above
items, but at this time, I want to formally express my comncern about |
the above 3 items, I would appreciate hearing from you as soon as possible,

Sincerely yours,
