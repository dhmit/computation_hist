Mr. Eenneth R. Dunipace
Executive Officer
Aerophysics Research Group
Room 41-203

Dear Hr. Dunipace:

in accordance with your request of January 6, I have discussed
your problem request for "ARG 704" with the Review Board on Wednesday,
January 8. After considerable discussion, I regret to inform you that the
board agein refused to approve your application for the following reasons:

 

1. Your request does not reveal the significance of the results
of these computations to the field of aerodynamics -- what
is the significance of this work?

2, Your application indicates that you do not intend to publish
results of your work -- except to your employer, WADC.

3. Your application does not substantiate the purpose of the
work congerning the calculus of variations approach, Do you
intend to use caleculus variations? If so, how will this be
done?

4. Your reguest for machine time =~ G5 hours -~ is excessive in
view of the faect that we schedule only 30 hours per week for
the entire university usage.

The above specific comments are presented since you asked for a statement
concerning the Review Boazrd objections.

As we discussed in our two meetings, we have a definite set of rules
concerning application and use of the 704 ~- occasioned by our operating
agreement with the IBM Corporation and other financing groups. I discussed
these with you in detail, and they are deseribed in our progress reports and
