If 1 braak memory 1nto amaller piecea, I have an added_prob-
Alem of resetting the boundary register each time I cross over.
This can be done of course by programming when the trap ocoura,
but I am not happy with the fixed boundaries, and the fact that
the mode changing would consume much time (an examination must be
‘made to find out if the trap was in a sense legal) and m&ght con-
ceivably oceur very frequently in a 1arge problem,

This, by the way seems to be the solution that IBM'was
yuzsuing up to the time that I spoke to them about my gsolution as
of & week ago Friday. If we can't get IBM to do better, we may
have to accept this, pfait I think they are in part receptive.

Thanks again for the susgeations.‘ 1 really do want us to
get back to the point where we can communicate. There is a great
deal that we ean all contribute if we take each other at face value.
