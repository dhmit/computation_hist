Committee on Machine Methods of Computation

April 11, 1951

Persong Present: R. R. Everett, H., Feshbach, Z. Kopal, C. Lin,
P. M, Morse, and E. Reissner

The Committee discussed several new proposals for research
assistantships for the progran for next year., The Mathematics
members reported that they had no further recoimencations at
present, though there wmight be more to recormmend later. Pro-
fessor Kopal reported that Leigh, who had been offered an as-
sistantship, has takan a job elsewhere, and that I'razier has been
siven a full-time job with Whirlwind., This, consequently, leaves
the one Blectrical =Engineering possibility, W. K. Taylor from
Bnzland, as still being on the list. Kopal hopes to hear from
hin in the near future. 7The Physics Department reported that
Mr. Spelsaan had taken a positlion elsewhere and proposed Leo
Sartori to take his place. This was approved by the Committee.

Morse reported the final program for the Conference on Use
of Computing Machines in Industry for May second and third.
After a short discussion on the methods of supervising the re-
search assistants next year, and on the supervision of Verzuh's
thesls, the Committee adjournecd.

There will be a meeting of the Committee next Wednesday,
April 18, at 10100 A.M., unless it turns out that there are no
applications for consideration. ;
