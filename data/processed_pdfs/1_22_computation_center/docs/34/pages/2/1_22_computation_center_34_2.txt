load into core memory a number of programs punched on relocat-
able cards where each program nominally begins in location O.

Each program would be preceded by a control card(?).
These control cards have the following format when used to
load programs which nominally begin at O:

OL, decrement: 40 octal; to identify this as a
control card.

OL, address: L, the length of the program, i.e.,
a number one greater than the nominal
location of the last word of the program.

OR, address: D, the amount by which any relocatable
references to data (i.e., locations
larger than L) should be relocated
(expressed in 2's complement form if
negative, )

Now suppose the loader followed by the programs and
their associated control cards are loaded in. The loader
occupies locations O through 137 octal. The 1lst program will
be relocated into locations 1&08 through (1378'+ Ll),

All relocatable references within the 1lst program to nominal
locations less than I, will be relocated by +1408 (or.-1408

in the case that they are relocatable as complements). All
relocatable references to nominal locations greater than or
equal to L, will be relocated by +D, (whether or not they are

relocatable as complements).
The 2nd program will be relocated into locations
(1&08 + Ll) through (137g + L, + LZ)' The relocatable refer- |
ences to nominal locations less than within the 2nd program
will be relocated by 1408 i Ll’ (or =-(1408 +.13)y Relocatable
references to nominal locations not less than L2 are relocated
by +D2°

 

(2) This control card serves somewhat the same purpose as what
is called an "origin card® in the Share Reference Manual,
but since its format and interpretation is quite different,
it seemed that the term "origin card" shouldn't be used
here.,
