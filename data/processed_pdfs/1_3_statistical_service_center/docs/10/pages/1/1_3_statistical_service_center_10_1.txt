Dear FProfessor Brownt

As Indicated in my letter of November 5, 1952,
I am now enclosing a revised description of the content
of the proposed subject entitled Computation by Punched-
Card Methods, I would like to recommen 1%1 “subject
be offered during the Fall Term 1953,

At the present time the Office of Statistical
Services does have a complete representation of IBM ma-
chines, 1In particular, the present availability of the
Card Programmed Calculator together with its general-
purpose plugboards enables one to set up problems in a
short time, Specifically, the instructions for a problem
may be written in less than an hour, Therefore this unit
is a most effective educational device, Furthermore, the
grant of a gratis installation consisting of an OR4 Key
Punch, an 082 Electronic Sorter, and an 402 Tabulator will
permit extensive laboratory use of such machines on an
individual student basis,

Very truly yours,

F. M, Verzuh
