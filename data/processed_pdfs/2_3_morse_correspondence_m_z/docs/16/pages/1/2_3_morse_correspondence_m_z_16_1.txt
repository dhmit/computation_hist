In a manner of brief introduction, I am an Assistant
Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Clarkson College of
Technology., Having recently completed an 1S degree under
Prof, Andrew Schultz, Dept. of Industrial and Engineering
Administration, Cornell University, I have become more and
more interested in the breadth of inductrial problems

rather general nature, It is likely that I shall be in the
Bo: ton vicinity some time during August. Perhaps at that
time we might be able to discuss your program in further detail
at your coaveaience,
