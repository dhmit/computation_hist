Many other elementary results in the cle-
mentary theory of numbers and in the clementary
theory of symbolic ex {pressions are provable in
the same strai.- shtforward way as the above, In
number thcory onec gets as far as the theorem that
if a prime p divides ab, then it divides either

B oY b, Howcver to formulate the unique
iactorl/atlon theorem requires a notation for
dealing with sets of integers. Wilson's theorem,

a moderatcly deep result, can be oxprossod in this
formalism but apparently cannot be proved by
recursion induction.

One of the most immediate problems in ex-
tending this theory is to devclop better techniques
for proving that a re ecursively defined function
converges. Ve hope to find some based on ambiguous
functions. lowvever, Godel's theorem disallows any

hope that a compnlete set of such rules can be
formed.
