Type 733 Magnetic Drum Unit,

2. A sketech of the floor panel cutouts for the Type 736
and 741 Units,

3. A sketch of the floor panel cutouts for the Type 737
Magnetic Core Unit,

4, A sketch of the floor panel cutouts of the duct
connections for the 704 Main Frame,

5, A 3/4" drawing indicating the field-measured dimensions
and locations of the holes which have been cut in the steel
floor of the 704 room.

You will notice that the first four are the sketches which you prepared
during your visit, Item five is a floor plan of the 704 room based on
actual field layout mecasurements made on the floor after we had completed
alli of our decisions., These may assist you in your work and planning
prior to the installation of the 704.

In closing, I again wish to thank you and Mr. DiBenedetto for your
wholehearted cooperation during your recent visit to MIT.
