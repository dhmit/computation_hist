ELECTRONIC COMPUTERS IN SOCIAI SCIENCE

The Facllity and Its Potentialities

The high-speed computing facility, to be installed by
IBM at the new Computation Center at MIT will be the largest and
most flexible facllity in this country to be devoted -exclusively
to unclassified research and education. IBM will econtribute more
than a fifth of a million a year in its support for maintenance
and operation. What is needed, in addition, to make this an out-
standing center for the investigation of digital computer
potentlalities in all branches of scientific research, is about
$100,000 a year for the support of a research staff, which can
work with scientists in various fields to develop new and more
effective techniques of machine utilization. :

| Arrangements have been made for all the colleges in New
England to participate in the use of the machines, and IBM has set
up funds for Assistantships tO enable graduate students, at MIT
and at the participating colleges, to spend time at the Center
learning to use the equipment. This Center and these arrangements
represent potentialities for new developments in social and
physical sclence of great and unexplored importance.

_ There will be no charge for machine time made to students
or faculty of the participating institutions. Maintenance and the .
routine aspects of operation will be taken care of by IBM, so that
those who know how to use such equipment can use it, without cost
up to the fourteen hours a day during which the machiné will be
avallable at first. A number of problemg in economics are going
to be put on the machine by Professor Soléw of MIT and by Professor
Orcutt of Harvard and, as other research workers in the social |
Sclences learn haw to use the equipment, other problems will be
brought to the Center. '
