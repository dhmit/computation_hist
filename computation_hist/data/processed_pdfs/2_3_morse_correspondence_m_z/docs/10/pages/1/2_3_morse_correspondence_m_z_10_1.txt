Memo to: R. s. Mulliken, Univ. of Chicago
From: F. M. Verzuh, MIT Computation Center

Subject: Procedure re Purchase Orders on Whirlwind Time

At the request of Professor Morse I have investigated
the best procedure for issuing a purchase order for Whirlwind
time and I therefore recommend that you make out a purchase
order to the following:

Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Division of Sponsored Research

77 Massachusetts Avenue

Cambridge 39, Massachusetts

Attention: Roger Webber, Room 5-105

The purchase order should read as follows:

For computational services of the Whirlwind
Computer at a rate of $250 per hour

Of course the amount will vary with the number of hours desired.
I believe you have indicated a desire for 32 hours, which means
a total of $8,000. In this connection I want to emphasize that
this work on the Whirlwind machine should be completed in large
part prior to March, as indicated by Professor Morse.

The Division of Sponsored Research office indicated,
however, that they would prefer a purchase order which does not
include special patent clauses, etc. Merely a purchase order by

the University of Chicago to M.I.T. for the above work would be
the appropriate form.
