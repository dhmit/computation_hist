In accordance with our conversations with the following our:
representatives ,

Dr. F. Joachim Weyl, Director of Math Sciences Division,
Washington, D. C.

Dr. Arthur Grad

Dr. Carl F. Iukenhaupt, Chief scientist, ONE, Boston

we recommend that you apply to ORR 103‘ an extension of the existing

contract (Project 6345) without additional guide, for the fiscal period
1957-58.

Because of the delay in the completion of the new

Karl T. Compton Laboratory, it will be impossible to install the
1m Type 704 Electronic Data. Processing Machine at ILLT. on March 1
as we originally scheduled. As a result, it will be impossible for us
to release our use of the Whirlwind Computer on June 30, 1957 as

‘ originally scheduled. It is very important that we have adequate time
to install the 704 and make the necessary conversion of programs from
whirlwind to the 704 language. This means that there will be some period
of time during which dual operation of both the 704 and Whirlwind Computers
is in effect. It is difficult to determine in advance the exact termina-
tion data of our use of the Whirlwind facility. However, as we discussed
at our-meeting, we shall notify you of the termination date as soon as
this information becomes available.

 

1E: ending the present contract without additional funds for the
above-requested 12-month period will permit us to effect a. smooth
transition from the Whirlwind machine to the 70/1; furthermore, it will
prev :6 us with the necessary time to prepare the final summary report
for 112152 contract.

 

 

Since we are not requesting any adriitionnl funds for this
Islam, we have not prepared the usual cstim d budge reign ements.
This is, 0'5? 6, in accerﬁance with our .13 'V .. our meeting
on Thursday ary 21.

   
 

   

    

 

Also, in accord with these discussions, we are currently preparing
a proposal 'to be sutmittod to mm for n specific research program, which
would be set up as) a separate project within the new 231‘): Computation Center,
designed to make new effective use of the Type 704 machine. This '
proposal will include researcﬁ items'of In mathematical nature
as we discussed with Wayl. A separate request ﬁor 01m
