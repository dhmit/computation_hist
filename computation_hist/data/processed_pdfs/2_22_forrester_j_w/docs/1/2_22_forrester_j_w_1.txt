Professor Philip M, Morse «2e August 14, 1950

R=178 describes the principles of the marginal
checking system which is built into the
© Whirlwind I computer,

‘Rel84 - covers some preliminary results of our
studies of vacuum tube life, The work of
the laboratory on pretesting of vacuum
tubes, on establishing conditions for longer
life and on the development of testing pro-
cedure such as marginal checking for the
detection of deteriorating components has
attracted widespread favorable comment from
the various electronic activities,

Project Whirlwind Summary Reports 21 and 22 and

Adr Traffic Control Project Summary keports 3 and 4
are examples of the quarterly reports which
wo have been submitting under our two contracts,

The Air 1raffic Summary Reports will te cone-
cluded with Fo, 5, now being printed, since
the projoct has teen redirscted to work far
the Valley Committee.

Reports by the laboratory seem to be im considerable demard
by outside organizations. A count of the six months from September 1
1949 to March 1, 1950 showed 9/ separate requests from 48 different
organizations for a total of 670 reports, These cre all specific re-
queats and do pot include the regular railing of about 200 copies of
each quarterly report, Of the 48 organizations, 20 were government

agencies, 9 were universities, and the remaining 19 were commercial
establishments,

Also included is & copy of & letter waich I prepared a
few weeks ago for Dr, Stratton, There has been ccnsiderable criticism
from tice to time, especially from persons interested exclusively in
mathematical sppiications of digital Coirucfis, of the short register
