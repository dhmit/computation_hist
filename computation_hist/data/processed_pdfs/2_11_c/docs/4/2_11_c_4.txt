Dear John:

Gs : Thanks Por your letter of December 22. 1 should be
“happy indeed to hear from Mr. Anderson. I have not heard

~ from-hem yet. Perhaps you could indicate to him that if he

wishes to apply for next year, he had better do it soon. I

have spread the word about your needs at Chapel Hill and now Nl

that the vacations are over, I will mention it again.

We are all sorry that you will not be with us this
‘coming term. We hope your plans for Chapel Hill are going
smoothly and we hope to see you soon. Is there any chance
that you will come this way during the spring?

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse
