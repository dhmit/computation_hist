Dear Dr. Pein:

I read your paper on "The Role of the University
in Computers, Data Processing, and Related Flelds" with some
interest and with some disagreement in spots.

The organization you mention is not a definite one
vet but if 1¢t comes about it will be one of directors of
university computing centers. The pro tem secretary is
Professor Walter F, Preiberger of Brown Unlversity, to whom
I am sending your letter. I suggest you send him a copy of
your paper.

Nelther he nor I could initiate the invitation to
you to come to a meeting of unlverslty computing center
directors. This would have T0 be done by the program com-
mittee after such a meeting has been decided on. Consequently
I am sending copies of this correspondence to Professor
Freiberger with the suggestion that he fille them for appro-
priate action at a later date.

Sincerely,

Philip MM. Morse
Director
