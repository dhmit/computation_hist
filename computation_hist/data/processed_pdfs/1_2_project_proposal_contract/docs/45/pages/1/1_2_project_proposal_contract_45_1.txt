ve referred your proposalof Getober 17 #02708 to :

Prof. P. M. Horse, who is CUheirmen of the MIT Committee
cn Maghine Methods of Computation. '

The Institute presently has in operation, supported
by the Air Force, a Uifferentlsl Analyser, a REAC, and the
vhirlwind Digital Computer (to which the lavy also conirl-
butes.) Ve have also an ONR progrsm conducted by Frof.

" Morse and some of his collesgues.

Becsuse of the undoubted overlep between what we
aré now doing, and what you wish done under titatement of
vork", we believe it would be advisable to have Lr. Horse
talk with Lt. Col. H. C. Henry &n¢ to Dr. Skinner who, we
uncerstand, 1= senior civilien in ARDC, end would be par-
ticularly interested in thle ares.

hegcause of the numbers of people involved and the
complexity of the problem I think it woulc be advisable
1f the suggested meeting could be held 2t the Tnatitute
where the equlpment and personnel can be essily assembled.

Very truly yours,
