should be used (i.e. no arguments).

8. In all systems references to tape and channel numbers
should be symbolic and indirect whenever possible. Thus there
will be a minimum of inconvenience whenever tape assignment .
conventions must be changed.

9. Each run in either the FMS or SOS system should have
an initial (I.D:) card with a format that will be specified by

the Center.

The physical channels and tapes used by the FMS system
along with the logical tape numbefs to be used in Fortran
programs are:

rhysical-Loglical-Function

Al - 1 - System

A2 - L - Input

L5 = 2 - OQutput for printing

Al - 8 - Fortran Intermediate

Bl - 5 - Binary Input Tape and Primary
Chain Tape

B2 - 6 - Fortran Intermediate and Secondary
Chain Tape

B?% = R - Fortran Intermediate and Secondary
Chain Tape

B BT - Qutput for punching

The programmer should not use in his program logical
tapes 1, 2, 3, 4 for other than their designated purposes and
should not rewind them. Tape 5, 6, 7 can be used without
restrictions as program scratch tapes if the CHAIN or the CALL

PDUMP features are not used.

Tape 8 can always be used as a program scratch tape.
