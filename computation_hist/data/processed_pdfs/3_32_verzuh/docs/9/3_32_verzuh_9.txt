Key Punch: Coding, key punching, printing, verifying,
and the interpretation of data into punched

cards.
Sorter: Card counting, numeric and alphabetic sorting.
Coliltor: Matching, merging, selection and comparison.
Reproducer: Gang punching, summary punching, reproducing i

and comparison.

 

Tabulator: Listing, group indication, printing, addi-
tion, subtraction, selection and automatic
control.

Calculators: +, —, x, f, programming, selection,
shifting operations by solmion of the some
