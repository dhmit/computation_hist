tract Mari-6001, NR one 097 to support, for a period or one
year from about November 1, 1952, certain research and anal sis
activities currently being established at the Naval war Col ege.

Specifically. the Naval War College has established a
new department called the "Research and Analysis Department".
It is the intent that this department shell support the mm by
conducting, supervising, and assisting with research and analy-
sis. and by providing liaison with relevant research and analy-
sis activities. '

To this end, the mic and the ONE desire MIT to rurnish
them with adequate scientific assistance. It is suggested that
this could be done by placing a staff member assigned to the
subject contract at the mm on full-time duty for the present
fiscal year. His task Would be: '

To- support, under the general supervision
or the Research and Analysis Department,

the other departments of the War College,
