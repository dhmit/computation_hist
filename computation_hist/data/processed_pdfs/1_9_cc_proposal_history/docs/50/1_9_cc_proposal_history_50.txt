: Subject: Courses Related to Computing Instrugents at M.I.T., Past,
Present, and Future
: Early Development - The amount of training, both formal and in-
formal, in the design and use of computing equipment has always |
been closely related to the availlabllity of such equipment, at
the Institute. It was available here quite early because of the
interest of Vannevar Push and his students. The Electrical Engi-
neering Department had most of this equipment before 1940, a
Differential Analyzer, a Network Analyzer and others, fhe few
courses concerned with machine computer design and use were E. E,
courses and were attended chiefly by E. E. majors. As the equip-
ment increased in effectiveness, however, staff and students of

other Departments became interested until, by 1940, at least half

 

 

of the 24 attendees of 6.60 Math--Anal. by Mechanical Methods

 

were from other Departments.

Since 1945, the Institute has added a great number of computing
devices to its facilities: Whirlwind, some I.B.M. equipment,
several large electronic analogue devices, and 80 on. Some of
these are in the Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering Depart-
ments, so that more students have close contact with their con-
struction and use. Because of the growing importance of such

| equipment in engineering and scientific training, the Institute

equipment, to suggest the introduction of new courses inthe field
and to help supervise student research in this area.

Institute of fers twelve courses primarily concerned with machine
computation. Two of them are given by the Mathematics Department:
M39 —Methods of Applied Mathematics and M41ll— Numerical Analysis’;
eight are given by the Electrical Engineering Department: 06.25 —
Machine-Alded Analysis (an introductory survey course for under-
graduates), 6.535—Dig. Comp. Coding and Logie, Int., 6.536 —
Machine Computation, 6.537— Digital Comp. App. Prac., 6.538 —
Electronic Comp. Lab., 6.54 —Pulsed-Data Systems, 6.567— Switching
Cireuits, and 6.568 —Switching Circuits; and one, 2.215 —Numerilcal
Analysis, 1s given by the Mechanical Engineering Department. The
teaching of all these courses is directly dependent on the avalla-
bility of equipment for demonstration and for student practice.

At present, the total enrollment in these courses is about 400,
Each of these courses could be improved if more equlpment were
available.

In addition, the following courses touch on computing machine
applications or on machine design and use some equipment for demon-
stration or for student use, which use could be profitably ex-
panded if more equipment were avallable:

Less Formal Tralning Opportunities - At least as important as the
formal courses mentioned above are the other chances for students
and staff to learn about computing equipment. The Whirlwind staff
gives several short courses each term in machine coding methods
for anyone who wishes to learn. Attendance has been between 20
and 40 per course. The Committee on Numerical Analysis and Machine
Computation has had about 16 Research Assistantships available for
graduate students of high standing in any Department, who wish to

learn computing machine techniques and who intend to use these


He
techniques in the course of their thesis research. These assistant-
ships have been very fruitful in the spread of the understanding
of machine capabilities throughout the Institute, for not only
does the graduate student and hls lmmedlate assoclates learn

about computing machines and their use but, even more important,

his faculty advisors in the various departments have a chance to

learn of the usefulness of the new machines in their specilal

fields. These advisors have sent more students to learn about
machine computation and have initiated more research using machine
results. For example, most of the professors of theoretlcal physlcs
are supervising thesis research in nuclear theory or solid state
theory, the computation of which will be done by Whirlwind or by

the I.B.M. equipment we have. Our research in nuclear reactor

design will have to be done with machine help.

 

Many of our best and most imaginative machine programmers
have been introduced to computing eguipment via these Assistant-
ships. They started out being interested in machines as a tool
to help them in their research in physics or chemical engineering
or whatever; they ended by being interested in the operation of
the equipment itself. Such assistantships or fellowships are a
vital part of our training program; their number should be 1in-
creased as soon as more machine facilities become avallable.
Future Expansion - With a few exceptions, it will not be necessary
to increase appreciably the number of courses concerned with
machine computation, if more machine facilitles become avallable;
what will be important will be the increase 1n contact hours per

student with the equipment. Some of the courses listed above now

have to limit their actual contaet:with machines to one or two

hours of demonstration per term, whereas they could and should ex-

pand this time enough so each student has a chanee to participate

in the operation, so he can actually get a "feel" for the process.

© Such an expansion of contact hours 1s impossible at present; with

careful scheduling it could be accomplished with an appropriately
located 704, with adequate space and auxiliary equipment. Even
with the courses listed above, it could easily grow to 3000-4000
student contact-hours per term.

As soon a& more equipment 1s available, more courses in
business data handling can be initiated and the course in operations
research can be expanded. Probably other courses, inc subjectsinot
yet envisaged, will also be made possible.

Plans are now being made to expand our research program in
operations research, in systems engineering and in the quantitative
analysis of industrial and governmental operation. Funds wlll be
sought to increase the number of assistantships and fellowships
which can be granted for research in these fields, so that we can
compete with other fields for the good students. None of these
plans could be implemented unless we are sure we will have the
best computing equipment, adequately housed and appropriately
staffed.
