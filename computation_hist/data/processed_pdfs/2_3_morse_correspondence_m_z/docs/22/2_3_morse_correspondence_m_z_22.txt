The group, about twelve  soniop officers, will arcive at M.I. T.
about 9.30 in their own cars from Newport. Is it possible to
‘arrange parking space for them? They wish to do the following

things while here: |

1. Hear about how machines work (operatson, not
~~ eonstruetion).

2. Hear discussion on “how Hizehines. alight be. used
~~ © in military planning. I'll talk about war 2
gaming, somebody should talk about the logistics
use (transportation, ete.)

: Have a chance to ask questions about 1 and 5

= ul

« Dee the Whirlwind movie.
5. See Whirlwind.
They will leave about 4 p.m. or before.

Will you let me know, by Ogtober 23, what order these flve
things should be in and who should take part, so we all won't
be tied up all day with them. For example, it would be nice
if they could see the movie and WW from 2,30 to 4.00 so we
could attend the seminar.
