I have looked into the matter of having the meeting of Directors
of University Computing Installations held in Allerton House. My report
on this is as follows:

The only time in May that Allerton House is available is
from later afternoon May 29 until 4 p.m. May 31. This date
overlaps the Memorial Day Weekend and may be completely
unsatisfactory. Nevertheless, I have made a tentative reservation
for 60 persons at Allerton House for this period.

The radio station of the University of Illinois, WILL, has in
the past and is willing to supply an engineer to make tape recordings of
the proceedings of the conference. The cost of this service is $4.00 an
hour for regular time and $6.00 an hour for overtime. Work on Saturday,
Sunday and holidays is considered overtime work.

The Stenographic Bureau of the University of Illinois has
experience in transcribing tapes recorded by the people at WILL. The
charge for this service is about $29.00 for one side of a tape. That
much tape represents about one hours recording. The Stenographic Bureau
would undertake the typing, multilithing and binding of a report on the
conference. Thelr rates for this are comparable for those of similar
service anywhere.

I believe that the above is all the information you asked me
to obtain. T would appreciate knowing whether you feel that there is a
chance that this tentative reservation will be used. In any case, please
let me know &s soon as possible whether vou want me to make the reser-
vation into a definite one or to cancel it.

Sincerely yours,
