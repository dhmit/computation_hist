Title 9; Proposed Research: Research on Digital Computer Operation
and ﬁtilization--Inves iga on n o

the patterns of operation of_ETectronic digital computers and the
methods whereby they can be used in mathematical and experimental
research; including studies of numerical analysis and machine pro-
gramming methods, investigation of the possibilities of the complete
mechanization of the sequence of recording, processing, analysis
and presentation of experimental data and the working out of such
specific applications of machine techniques to problems in science,
engineering, and administration as will clarify the basic research
and suggest new points of view.

 

Desired Starting Date: July 1, 1956

Time Period: Three years, with a reassessment during the fall of
195§ to determine whether further support is advisable.

Pro osed Research; Background Information: We are organizing what
should be one of the most fruitful centers for research related to
the use of electronic computers in this country. IBM is contributing
one of its 70” machines, maintained and equipped with appropriate
auxiliary equipment. IBM and MIT are providing the building, part
of the new Compton Laboratory, and MIT is contributing some of the
staff from its departments of mathematics, electrical engineering,
physics, and industrial management. The machine will be available,
35 or more hours a week, free of machine time charge, to MIT staff
and students for non—classified and non-routine research. MIT '
research in the Center will be coordinated by the Institute Machine
Computation Committee (see Appendix A for names).

In addition, the Center will be available, up to 35 hours
a week, on the same basis, to other colleges in New England. Already
23 institutions have indicated their interest in participating and
have appointed faculty members to be their Institutional Representa-
tive (list of participating colleges and representatives given in
Appendix A). These representatives will coordinate the research
done on the machine by students and staff of their institution.
IBM is providing some funds for stipends for graduate students who
wish to learn machine use by helping with some of this research.

In this atmosphere and with these facilities, there is an
unparalleled opportunity to do important and basic research in all
phases of the use of digital computers in science, engineering,
and business. A central research group, supervised by faculty
members and staffed by workers picked from the graduate students
of MIT and other colleges, working closely with persons from the
other colleges, will help coordinate the work of the Center and
will carry on research of their own in machine logic, in techniques
of machine computation, and in Specific applications of machine


:2—

operation to experimental and theoretical problems, thus appreciably
broadening the range of applicability of computers in the physical
and social sciences and in engineering.

It is appropriate for government agencies to help support
the research of this central research group. The group's work will,
in part, provide an expanding basis of knowledge of numerical
analysis and programming techniques, which can be used by the other
participants at the Center and will, in part, break ground in new
fields of mathematical logic and methods of data processing which
will be needed in the application of digital computers to new tasks.

Most of the senior staff for such a research group is
already assembled at the Institute. Part of it is the group which
developed Whirlwind I programming; others are in various departments
of the Institute. From time to time, some of the staff of the
participating colleges would Join it for a semester or a year, on
leave from their institution, to work full-time at the Center.

IBM and the Institute will contribute about a half million
dollars a year to provide the equipment, building, maintenance, and
operating staff of the Center. We believe that a contribution of
about $100,000 a year will support the activities of the central
research group, which will energize and take the lead in the re-
search carried on at the Computation Center by students and staff
of MIT and the participating colleges. We list later in this
proposal some of the specific research projects we are prepared to
start on. Other proJects will develop naturally from these and
from the problems encountered by the other workers at the Computation
Center.

The project would not start at full strength.‘ The 70% will
not be installed until January or February 1957, though analytic
work can be started before the machine is installed. The present
Whirlwind computing research group can be supported by the present
ONR contract until December 1956, but a few new staff members must
be brought in in September in order to get ready for the new machine
installation. We estimate that a total budget of $60,000 would
suffice for the next academic year, $90,000 for 1957—58 and $100,000
for 1958—59. Details are given later in this proposal. At the
beginning of 1959 the program should be reoevaluated to determine
needs beyond that time,

After conversations with the scientific directors and
division chiefs of ONE and NSF, we are requesting financial support
from both agencies, an a? share rom each. We believe the work
can be divided so ” ”acts can be written. Some of
the proposed tasks a, though some of the broader
fields of investig up. We would hope that we could


-3-

put out a combined progress report. In some published papers,
credit could be given to one organization alone; in others, credit
would go to both. Bookkeeping would be somewhat more complicated,
but since most of the expense would be for salaries, little for
permanent equipment, this could be done. It probably would be
necessary to have the usual government overhead for both contracts.

The proposed budget asked of each agency for 1956-57 is
given below. The corresponding amounts for the following two years

wguld be Sh5,000 for 1957-58 and $50,000 for 1958~59, as indicated
a ove.

1. Investigation of Structure and Syntax of input
languages; the possibilities of coding directly in mathematical,
logical or business language.

2. Development of routines capable of translating from
algebraic notation to computer code and vice versa, including
possibly automatic selection of numerical techniques and automatic
error analysis. \

3. Development of numerical analytic techniques particu-
larly suitable for use by digital computers; such as more general
expansions, truncated Chebyshev polynomials sums for simulating
standard functions by a common block of instructions but small
separate blocks of coefficients and cycle counters and methods of
automatic determination of best grid spacing, by trial plus
Richardson extrapolation or other means.

u. Investigation of Monte Carlo techniques for large
problems.

5. Extension and/or improvement of present techniques
for communication between machine and operator and for the more
flexible control of machine operation, including possible improve—
ments in input-output equipment.


-4-

6. Experimental analysis and control using data
transmitted directly between computer and experiment.

7. Investigation of microprogramming and other methods
for increasing the flexibility of computer design. The possibility
of inclusion of a very flexible control unit in a large-scale
computer which would permit ready alteration of an order code.‘

8. Investigation of techniques for intercommunication

between computers, including the possibility of cycles different">‘

in length or kind running simultaneously with frequent comparison,
e.g. several single-accumulator computers with common memory and.
the behavior of a computer with multi 1e accumulators. Some of
these properties can be simulated on 8 70h by utilization of addi—
tional drums and magnetic core banks.

9. Computer estimation of problem time. In linear
problems, estimations of bounds of certain functionals, and thence
convergence criteria for terminating iteration, or switching to a
different iteration.

Facilities: The MIT Computation Center will have a Type 70#
Electronic Data Processing Machine with the following machine
complement: 12 magnetic tape units, 2 magnetic CORE storage units
containing a total of 8,000 words, 1 magnetic drum unit containing
#,000 words of storage, the usual on—line punched card reader,
alphabetic printer, and punched card recorder as well as the 3
off-line magnetic tape controlled printer, magnetic tape controlled
card punch, and punched card-to-magnetic tape converter, respectively.
In addition to the 70%, there will be 10 auxiliary punched card
machines including card punches, collators, sortere reproducers,
interpreters, and the Type “07 Accounting Machine. The aggregate

ggﬁhine rental, in excess of $50,000 per month, will be donated by

' The Type 70h EDPM unit is one of the fastest large-scale
commercial computers available today. Since the MIT installation
will be but one of many in the field, techniques, programs, and ~‘-
numerical procedures developed for this machine will be of use to
others having access to 70% equipment.

One half or this contributed by NSF $30,000
Requested for year beginning July 1,'1956~

£222 25 Overhead: The suggested overhead is larger than most NSF
grants. in the present case, however, the research is intimately
dependent on the functioning of a large computing center, most or

the support of which will beborneby other sources. It is necessary
and appropriate that NSF contribute, to some extent to the operation
of the Center, the services or which this Project will use continually.
There is no simple procedure for itemizing this cost as a direct
charge, so it is included as an increase in the usual overhead.
