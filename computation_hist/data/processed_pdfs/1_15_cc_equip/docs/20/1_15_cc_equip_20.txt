Dear Dr, Hunter:

In accordance with our recent discussions concerning the need
for magnetic tape in the M I.T, Computation Center, I now estimate that
we will be using between 200 and 300 reels of tape -- the exact number
depending on the somewhat-uncertain requirements of the N,E, universities,

I would very much appreciate it ifiyou would immediately order

20 reels of tape (2400 foot length) for use in the M.I,T, Computation Center,

We have discussed the choice of reel length and feel that we should use
1200 or 2400 feet, preferably the latter,

I would appreciate any attempt you may be able to make to
expedite the delivery of the above-mentioned 20 reels of tape in order
that we may begin to test out some of our programs and prepare libraries
of subroutines which are currently being punched on IBM cards,

1 am looking forward to discussing this request as well as some
of our needs regarding associated equipment in the 704 area, as your
convenience during the week of December 3-7, Incidentally, according to
Peyson IBM representatives from New York City may be up some time to assist
us in our planning, Please advise me of the date of their arrival as soon
as you hear,

Sincerely yours,

F. 8, Verzuh
