COMMITTEL ON MACHINE METHODS OF COMPUTATION

Minutes of the Third Meeting
Academic Year 151-152

Persons Present: H. Feshbach, J. W. Forrester, C. Lin and
P. M, Morse

Forrester reported that pressure on the Whirlwind
was somewhat lessenad now and that he hoped that the research
agsistants could be taken on by Adams in ths near future,  1t
wag ezreed that this would be announced at the next saminaxr so
that the assistants could make arrangements with Adams to start
work at Whirlwind.

Morse reported that a request for a proposal caue
from the Air Research and Development Command for work on
various differential and integral equations, including the
Sehroedinger equation, to investigate methods of solving these
equations on various computing machines. Morse reported that,
after consideration, it appeared not advisable to take on
another separate contract to do work that we were already doing
in the main, and that he wrote to Sage to this effect, adding
that we would be glad to talk with representatives of the
Research and Development Command as to how they could join in
with the Office of Naval Research in a combined contract for
this sort of work next year. This was, in general, approved by
the Comnittee.

Morse reported that the first quarterly report was
now in process of printing. He asked for sugiestions for a
distribution list. It was suggested and agreed that, for the
next several meetings of the Committee, people from other de-
partments be invited who might be interested in machine calcu-
lation so that the Cormittse can get a clearer idea of the
total demand on the Institutet!s machines in the near future.
Morse asked that the Cormittes menbers send him suggestions as
to who should be invited. It was agreed that the next meeting
of the Cormittee should be about the first Wednesday in
December.
