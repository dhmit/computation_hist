Mr. Hicks had 2 any been offered a teaching felis chin in
Mathematles, but the de partment shought that he would be a

gocd possi bility for this position. The Committee considered
his case and recommends that the Mathematics Department offer

2

him a choice of a teaching fellowship in Mathematics nr an
assistantghlp in Machine Computa ation.

Morse showed the letters af recommendation waich had
come in for Mr. Sol I. Rubinow for a post-doctoral assistant-
ship. The Committee decided to approve his Epa and
accordingly recommends to the Phvsics ep that he be
appointed a post-doctoral research assistant in this field for
next year. Presumably he would re port 5 Professor Feshbach
for his work. The Physics Department will send out the ap-
points enc and Morse will write Rubinow, indicating the nature
of his assignments.

There will be no Atk ing of the Committee next Wednesday,
