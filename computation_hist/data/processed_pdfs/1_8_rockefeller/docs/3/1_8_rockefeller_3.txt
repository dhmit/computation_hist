OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT
November 14, 1957

Dear Professor Morse:

Professor Dr. A. Walther has written us from
Darmstadt, Germany, about the errors in the caption for
the picture of the M.I.T. Computation Center as printed
in the President's Review and the Annual Report.

Doubtless you had noticed these errors also and
I am writing to tell you how sorry we are that we made them.
There is no excuse for our errors; no captions were furnished
with the prints, but the responsibility for accuracy
remained ours.

We have written our sincere regrets to Professor
Walther and have expressed to him the hope that the lay
reader would nevertheless get the main point, namely,
that your Center is exploring the possible application of
computer techniques to problems in the social sciences.

We shall try not to let this happen again.
Sincerely yours,

ht ANN aria
