Re: Office of Statistical Services

The purpose of this memorandum is to clarify the
functions of the Office of Statistical Services and the rela-
tionships between this office and other agencies at the
Institute.

The primary responsibility of the Office of Statis-
tical Services is to furnish its services to the administra-
tive offices, the teaching departments and the research pro-
jects, As & service unit, it is not expected to carry on
teaching activities or to assume the project supervision of
sponsored research, Teaching responsibilities may be
accepted by the Director of the Office but these responsi-
bilities will be his personally and not that of the Office itself.
The I'.LC, research project now supervised by the Office
will be completed but further projects of this type will not
be undertaken. The Office will of course continue to provide
services to the I' I,C, research projects throughout the
Institute where the responsibility for project supervision is
not that of the Office of Statistical Services, l.lkewise in
teanching, the use of the machines of the Office will be sched-
uled for teaching purposes when this is possible, but again
the responsibility for courses in computational methods and
similar courses will not e that of the Office.

 

Hereafter the Director of the Office of Statistical
Services will serve only as an advisor to the Instrumenta-
tion Laboratory with respect to the Rockefeller Differential
Analyzer, The Instrumeatation Laboratery will have com~
plete jurisdiction over this machine, being responsible for
its personnel, equipment, space requirements, budget and
fiscal administration, The Analyzer will continue to be
available for work required by other laboratories or by
departments for thesis work or other types of work but
arrangements for its use and for the payments required in
return should be made with the Instrumentation Laboratory.
Accounting procedures and billing methods will be subject
to approval by the D.1.C, Fiscal Office. The Analyzer will
be under the complete management of the Instrumentation
i.aboratory,
