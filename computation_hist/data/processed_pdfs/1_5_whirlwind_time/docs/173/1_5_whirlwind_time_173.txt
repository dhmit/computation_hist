Dear Dr. Foster:

Since Professor Adams has gone on leave of absence for a year,
I have undertaken to answer your letter of 7 February concerning the
billing for 21 luncheons for "ERA, et al" on 18 January 1955.

The Digital Computer Laboratory (DIC 6345) and the Servomech.

of various laboratories that are developing routines to be used with
Remington Rand's 1103 computer (also called, Univac Scientific).

: The immediate objective of the MIT conference was to discuss
a routine being developed at the Digital Computer Laboratory that will |
enable the Servo Lab to prepare tapes on Whirlwind I for the 1103, This
work may lead to a proposal for a DIC contract with Remington Rand that
will facilitate our study of a "universal" code; that is, a code that
can be applied to different computers.

Please let me know if I ean be of any further assistance.

Very truly yours,

Jack D, Porter, Head
Scientific and Engineering
Computation Group
