# computation_hist

## About

This project is aimed at studying the History of Computation at MIT between 1950 and 1962. 
Utilizing the MIT Archives' collection of documents from when the IBM 704 first came to 
the Institute, we are able to analyze the key events and players of bringing one of the first 
computers to the campus.

## Why Now?

MIT recently announced the creation of the Schwarzman College of Computing to begin in 2019, 
affording the perfect opportunity as humanists to reflect on the history of computation at the 
Institute in the past.
