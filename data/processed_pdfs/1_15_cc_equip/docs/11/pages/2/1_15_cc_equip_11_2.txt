exceed the dimensions we measured in the field, since we were concerned

about the length of cable between the 759 and 7Z7RD units, o

In closing, I again want to thank you and your group for your ;
wholehearted cooperation in working very bng hours under trying conditions

during this two-day period, -

Sincerely yours,
