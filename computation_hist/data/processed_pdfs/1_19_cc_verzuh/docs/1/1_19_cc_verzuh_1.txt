Director of Publications
Room 7-211

Dear John:

 

In accordance with our discussions concerning the cover
for the new progress reports for the Computation Center, I am enclosing
the following material which may be of some value to you:

1) Typical 704 symbolic punched cards used as input media

= 2) Typical subroutine used as part of am input program for
= the 704

 

3) Typical output tabulator printed document--illustrating
one form of the results obtained from the machine

4) Photographs of equipment in the 704 Room.

The above four items are only a portion of what may be of interest to
you in designing a cover.

I am also enclosing a copy of the covers we are currently
using in the Statistical Services--illustratimg the roll of the punched
card, MIT Seal, etc, I understand you have copies of the many preceding

covers used on our Whirlwind reports--in the way of past experience in
this area,

Finally, I have some very defimite ideas on this matter which

I would be happy to discuss with you after you have had a chance to
think about it a bit,

Sincerely yours,

F, M, Verzuh
