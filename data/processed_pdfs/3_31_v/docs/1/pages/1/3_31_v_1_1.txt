Dear Miss Kirby:

In accordance with your request that your High
School Math Club visit the MIT Computation Center on
Saturday, May 23, 1 am pleased to inform you that we will
have the computer in operation on that date. Furthermore,
we can arrange to have someone present a tslk to your group,
as well as give you a tour of the 704 computer. I suggest
we plan to meet in the Reception Room at 1:00 p.m. We are
looking forward to seeing you at that time.

Sincerely yours,
