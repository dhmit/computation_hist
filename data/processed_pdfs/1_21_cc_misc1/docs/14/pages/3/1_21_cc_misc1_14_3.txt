1s not so great that we should be unable to show a possible re-
sult in a year and a half. With reasonable luck we should have
both the flow-diagram and at least a first version of the code
completed.

This code would of course have some immediate practical
use, but much more important would be the lessons we can learn on
how practical the high speed computers are for solving symbolic
problems and what is the best way of utilizing them. We propose
to write a specific code for the IBM 704 because we have ample
time available to us on such a machine., However, the theoretical
conclusions, as well as the flow-diagram, would be of use on any
high speed computer, and even the adaptation of the specific code
should take much less time than its original writing. Hence, we
believe that a very wide class of computers would profit from the
results of this work. Last but not least, we hope that this work

will suggest some improvements in computing machine design.
