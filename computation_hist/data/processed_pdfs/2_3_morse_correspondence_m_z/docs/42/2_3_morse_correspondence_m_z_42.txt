Dear Dr. Casagrande:

I am sorry to have to report that I will
be busy giving a special course at M.I.T. on
machine programming during the last two weeks of
August, so I will not be able to attend your
session on O.R. Otherwise I would have been
pleased TO COME; it looks like it will be an
interesting discussion.

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse

PMM: LWH
