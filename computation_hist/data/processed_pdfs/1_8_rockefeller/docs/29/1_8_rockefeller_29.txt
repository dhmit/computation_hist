Memo to: Institutional Representatives

From: Professor Philip M. Morse, Director
M.I.T. Computation Center

Dear Colleague:

Our next meeting will be on Monday, December 17,
at 12:15 in Dining Room 2 at the M.I.T. Faculty Club, Sixth
Floor of the Sloan Building, 100 Memorial Drive, Cambridge.
Part of the agenda will have to do with our plans for
development of the NSF and Rockefe ts. The enclosed
item will perhaps indicate some of the things we plan to do
under these grants. As you can see, some of the activity
would be of interest to some of you, and we hope some of the
faculty of the participating universities could take part in
the research. We will talk about these matters at our meet=-
ing, and I'll be glad to answer questions.

Other items on the agenda were mentioned in the
previous notice.

Sincerely,

wa AN
Philip WM. Re Â©
