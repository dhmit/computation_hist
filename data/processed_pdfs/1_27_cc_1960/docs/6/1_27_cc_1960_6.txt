From P.li.liorse, Director I. I. T. Computation Center,

Subject: Replaceuent of 704 by a Y090,

Background = In June, 1957, somewhat less than three years
ago, a, 704 wes installed at the Computation Center by IBl, under
a special agreement whereby IBI maintains the equipment, contri
butes toward anortizing the additions to the Compton LOROTaTany A
which house the Center and supports a number of res arch ARR
ciates who assist users of the machine, and pai stafifd and oper
ates the Center for the use of Li and other cooperating New
England colleges and universities, The primary purpose of the

are as important a part of the educational equipment of a modern
college as are chenistry laboratories, for Xample. A secondary

purpose is fo foster research in the use of computing machines,
particularly in those fields of applics tion which have not yet
been explored or exploited fully,

To this end, priority on 704 time has been accorded to

special ceding courses which are given by the Center staff during
cach term and summer. A number of other colleges bring some of
their classes in for one or more laboratory sessions. Class use
will expand further, but its expansion will be haipered by the
linitations of access Go the 704, as will be discussed later,

The use of the machine by the other calleges has expanded
rapidly until nearly a full shift is now cccupied with their work
(including their class exercises). But this use tence to be self=
Riuipine for, as soon as a college faculty begins ful y to apprec-
ate the possibilities in education and reseanch of Cemeteries, the

pressure builds up for a machine of their owa on thelr own campus.
By now at least eight of the cooperating institutions hwy > 22 Iagines
of their own. These are smaller machines, of the 650 AR "50 Pepi),
ege instituions still come to the Center to use the Y04 for their
bigzer jobs; buv it does mean that the use of the Center ly the
other New fngland colleges will tend to level off to a recjonable
load (about one shift, it now app pears) rather than growing -~ontin-
uously, as the HIT usage is doing. This result, of course, is in
accord with our conviction that computers should be as prevent
as chemistry laboratories.
In contrast, the LIT use of the 704 for research into 1sw
ications has grown so that now we are not able to savisfy 11

which enables the 704 to be used on languaze translation problems;

logic, such as algebraic and other symbolic naaipulation, are
being developed and tested, The work at LIT in ¥his field, since
whirlwind days, is well known,

Time-gharing Technigue vie already have a typewriter connected
to the 704, which works on a basis wi.th our regular
operator routine, so new programs can be debugzed wt the same vime
that regular computations are being cerried out on other problems,
for example. the Y04 cannot effectively accomodate more than one
or two such sa telite chonnels, bub the Center staf! is now atv work
on the design and programming required to provide a V090 with 410
to 3.0 such "substation consoles" of various effective speeds and
capacities, which can be placed at appropriate places pround LIT,

the experiment or the scientist can go on to the next step and
request the next computation in turn. On the 704 this would
reguire the exclusive use of the machine, though only a fraction
of the 704 speed would be used; obviously again, time-sharing
techniques are needed, |

These, and many other programs now in progress, such as
the character-recognition studies ~~ © _ , the research
cn economic forecasting end on operational behavior using large-
scale simulation techniques, should be of particular interest to
LB, for they have direct bearing on the progress of computer
design and utiliza Glon., They represent the sort of cooperative
research between experts in different fields which EIT does so
effectively, and they involve the combination of research and
education for which ilIT 1s pre-eminent. This work deserves
support by IBil, in addition to the educational activities which
are already being supporied a the present contribution of the 704,
They can most erfec tiara i the installation of a 9090, replacing
the 70%, in the near future; IIT will then be able to provide
the «=== ancillary equipment to push ahead with dispatch.
Because of the "inter-connectedness" of much of this research,
it can best be carried out (perhaps it can only be carried out)
in the atmosphere of mutual cooperation and exchange of infor-
nation provided by the Computation Ceber, As
