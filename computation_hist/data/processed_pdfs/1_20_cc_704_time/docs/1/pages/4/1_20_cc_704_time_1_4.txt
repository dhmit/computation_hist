Does the programmer(s) intend to prepare the input cards?

________________________
If the answer to 8 or 9 is no,

what plans have you?

_____________________________
(Ordinarily, programming and card punching have to be done by the programmer. If

, special arrangements have to be made.)

When will program testing probably start?

For cataloging purposes, how would you index this problem? For example, mathema-

tics, logic, game, etc. If this is a mathematical problem, specify type(s) such
as integration, partial differential equations, matrix theory, etc.

 

 

If this is a mathematical problem, specify numerical methods used, such as
Gauss' quadrature method, difference equations, Crout, etc.

On one or two additional sheets write sections A, B, and C as follows:

Section A: A one-paragraph abstract of Section B and C.

Section B: Complete description of problem background which should give com—

Section C: Description of numerical and computer techniques to be used

nent, the number of significant figures accuracy required at
various stages of the calculation and the ranges and values of
the quantities involved in sufficient detail so that program
complexity may be estimated. In addition, indicate how you

plan to test the programs and whether you have test cases
available.
