4n over-all grasp of 1ts properties. Such "gawming techniquea®

are olosely related to the experiments of Bavelam on the behavior
of task-oriented groups. The use of a propevly programmed computer
would provide such experiwments with a powerful and flexible meansa
of changing, controlling, and analyzing these experiments in soolal
psychology. In thia field we could work in close gollaboration
with the Center for International Studies at M.I.T. and with the
psychology departmenta in several other colleges.

 

EE'_‘E}.’Q?.‘?Q Budget - The three general areas of study Juat mentlioned
are examples of filelds of research in computer teohniquesa quite
different from those used in the physical sclencesa, but onea
equally Important and promising. The budget for the group to work
in the physical sciences will run about 100,000 a year. A s1oup
of roughly equal size would be needed for the parallel work in

the social sclences. The added ataff would be, in part, soccial
scientists with an Interest in computers and in part mathematiclans
and computer speclalists with an Intereat in sccial sclence. The
group should work together for several years, An approprisue rabe

and duration would be ¥1l00,000 a year for five yeara,

This budget would bve adminlstered by the Cowputation
Center and would be for the support of a group, worklng at the
Center, investigating wachlneé technlguaes of particular value **n
the social sciences, as dlacussed earller In this proposal. When
other divisions, such as the Sloan School or the Boonomioa Depart-
ment at Harvard, are able to organize research or educational
programs which utlillize these techniques in their flelda, with
separate financial support, they will find a nuoleus of collabora -
tors and advisors at the Center, whilch can asee that their program
does, in fact, utilize the facilitien of the Center in an effective

manner.
