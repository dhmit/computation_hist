Dear Dr, Morse:

I want to extend to you our sincerest thanks for the very
fine field trip which we were privileged to make to the
Computation Center,

Since I have been in Winchester, I can recall of no
other field trip that aroused such genuine interest. In many
of their other classes the students brought up the svbject of their
trip for class discussion,

Not only were the students amazed by the action of the
Computer, but they were especially impressed by your presentation
of the subject, I know that you had a decided influence on
many of those present,

I, myself, wish to express my personal thanks to you with
the feeling that with the co-operation of people such as you
we can continue to maintain the high level of science preparation

at Winchester,
Sincergly yog;ii;z;;)
