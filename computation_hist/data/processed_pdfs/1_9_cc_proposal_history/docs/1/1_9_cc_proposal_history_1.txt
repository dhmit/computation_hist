A giant computer, first of a new high-sneed type for education
and basic research, is to be installed at ilassachusetts Institute of
Technology,

Jade available by International Business Machines Corporation,
the commuter will be the principal tool in a new electronic data pro-
cessing center, plans for which were announced jointly today by Dr.
James R, Killian, Jr,, president of 4.1.7., and Thomas J, Watson, Jr.,
president of IBM.

Other colleges and universities in New ingland have been invited
to share in the use of the machine for research and education of stu-
dents in commuting techniques. The commuter will be installed in
early 1957 in the Karl Taylor Commton .lemorial Laboratories, which
M1.1.T. 1s now building in Cambridge at a cost of t:l,000,000., Dr,
Philip MM, Morse, Professor of Physics, will be director of the compu-
tation center,

The computer will be an IB31 Tyne 704 i) ectronic Data Processing

Machine, latest of the '

‘electronic brains designed for solving mathe-
matical oroblens in engineering, science, social science and manage-
ment studies, Its speed is so creat that in one second it can perform

LL0,000 additions or subtractions or 5,000 multiplications or divisions

of 10-digit numbers,

IBM Computer 2e

With a staff of more than thirty neople, the M.I.T. center will
be the largest and most versatile data processing facility yet to be
made available primarily sor education and basic research, IBM not
only will install the machine but will contribute to the cost of main-
taining and operating st. The comnany will also make & grant support-
ing studies of research assistants to be selected from New England
colleges.

"The development and application of electronic data processing is
profoundly influencing tae education and work of engineers, while at
the same time the use of computers 18 ranidly spreading in science,
government, industry and business," sald a statement issued by Dr,
Killian and Mr. Watson.

nGreat computing machines are making vnossible advances in research
and analyses not hitherto noseible and consequently are becoming
essential tools for business and financial organizations. ducational
institutions will make inereasing use of them and will have a major
responsibility to educate men and women to realize thelr full poten-
tials."

M.I.T.'s School of Industrial Tanagement plans to undertake a new
program Of studies in "operations research," the new field in which
data processing nethods are annlied to manufacturing and distribution
problems that are so complex they could never be solved by old-
fashioned methods.

Other fields in which research 1s expected tO be done include
aerodynamics, where computations will lead to & better understanding
of shock waves at transonic and qupersonic speed; meteorology, where
rapid assimilation ~f weather data cal lead to better forecasting;
atomic research, where calculations can throw new light on sub-atomlc

particles, and solid state physics, in which efforts are peing made tO
