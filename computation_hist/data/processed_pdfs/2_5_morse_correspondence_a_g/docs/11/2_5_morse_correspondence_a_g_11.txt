Dear Philip:

I thank you very much for your letter
of April 17 and congratulate you on
your new quarters for the Computation
Center. I've added the center to our
mailing list for future copies of our
newsletter. I'll see what I can do
about back issues but don't expect
much. Our vellum masters are. ruil
ragged; we have about 700 names on our
mailing list. Also it's a lot of work.
Anyway we're just getting startea and
the future issues will be the good ones.
The one for May pertains to the Chi-
Square integral.

The work is going fairly well but we're
