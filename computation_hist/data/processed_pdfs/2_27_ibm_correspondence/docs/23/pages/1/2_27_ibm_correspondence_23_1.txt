Mr. Philip M. Morse, Director
MIT Computation Center
Cambridge 39, Massachusetts

Dear Phil:

I have your letter of December 5 and have started to look into
the situation, and you will hear from me very shortly on it.

I would like very much to come up to Cambridge Friday,
December 20, but I have been under certain pressure from
Jim Killian to help him and have responded to it. This sort
of wrecks my schedule so I hope you understand the reason
for my absence on December 20. I would like to take a
raincheck.

Best regards.

Sincerely yours,

M apiect
