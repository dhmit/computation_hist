Dear Phill,

On January 9 and 10, 1958, we will be entertaining about
150 college publicity, publications, and public relations
people for the annual meeting of the New England District,
American College Public Relations Association.

I assume that essentially all of the New England colleges
and universities which are participating in the Computation
Center will be represented. This being so, would you be
willing to arrange a meeting of publiclty people from these
schools, to see the computer and to hear about the program
for cooperating New England colleges? This I assume would
include a visit to the computer and a brief discussion of
the program - together with some examples of work which is
underway through the cooperative program, pure
We will have some time late in the morning of January 9 | 44h |
and again that afternoon; or we could put this one on the\ {1 FH
program for Friday morning, January 10,

Would you be good enough to discuss this one with your

colleagues - and in due course let me know what you con-
clude?
