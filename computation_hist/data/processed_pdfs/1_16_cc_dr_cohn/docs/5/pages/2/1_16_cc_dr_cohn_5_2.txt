where rs".- are running coordinates. At these surfaces the partial derivatives of go of the

second or higher order may have discontinuities While 4; and 6w/332; remain continuous,
as may occur when two solutions are patched together. .

The image of a ﬂow under the mapping z.- —+ uf is deﬁned to be its hodograph, In
general, three—dimensional ﬂows have three-dimensronal hodographs, but not the ex.
amples in the following sections. Flows with one (two):dimensional hodograpils have
been called simple (double) waves. The relevant properties of Simple waves, discussed
in [3], will be summarized brieﬂy. For some function M30), u; = mot). Now (2.1) implies

(2211(qu = (um/)2 = ((19,)2 (2.5)
where u; = dug/(1H. The hodograph is any curve obtainable from a Prandtl—Meyer epi.
cycloirl by deforming its plane into a cone with vertex at u; = 0.'To specrfy the curve
completely an additional equation and initial conditions are requued. For example, in

a swept Prandtl—Meyer ﬂow the velocity component parallel to a ﬁxed unit vector 1,»
must be constant, that is,

ugh. = constant. (2.6)

In the physical space the prototype of the hodograph point u.(;r), a surface p = constant
which also bears constant pressure, density, and entropy, is a plane normal to ué . The
exact locations of the prototype planes in the physical space are as yet undetermined.
If all are forced to pass through a common point, the simple wave will be a conical ﬂow.
Finally, note that a prototype plane is a characteristic surface, all of whose Mach cones
are congruent and have parallel axesl

Now let

X“ = asa/z(a = 1, 2), z : $3 , w = US (2.7)

Later it will also be convenient to use X = XI , Y = X; , u = u,- , and v = u2 . Note
that to a point (curve) in the X1X2—plane there corresponds in the acrspace a line through
(cone with vertex at) the origin. Consider a general conical ﬂow with vertex at the

origin. Since u, = (ha/Bx, are homogeneous of degree Zero in the x, 8, gr: may be assumed
with no loss of generality to be homogeneous of degree one. Then for some <1)
(.0 = ”(Xi yXi) (23)

and (2.1) becomes

[112(6“: + XnXt) — (11.. —— u'Xa)(z/5 — 11-11(5)) 32(11/3X" 6X5 2 0. (2.11)

lharacteristics for (2.11) are curves XL, = Xn(t.) in the X,X,—p1ane on which the partial
derivatives of <1) of second or higher order may have discontinuities, While (I) and rich/BX,
remain continuous. To these curves there correspond cones x“ r'z : Xa(l) on which, by
(2.10) or its analogs the partial derivatives of (p of second or higher order Will have
corresponding discontinuities, while by (2.8) and (2.9) (p and (as/ax. remain continuous.
