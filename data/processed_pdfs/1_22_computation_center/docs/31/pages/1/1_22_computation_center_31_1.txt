Memorandum CC-22: Notes on the Sky-Blue Compiler
Supplement 1: On functions which produce more than
one quantity as output

by: John McCarthy July 11, 1957

& This section is independent of the kinds of aguantity th
way be allowed. Many subroutines which one would lilke a
to use produce more than one number as output. In FORTRA
rules for composing functions cannot conveniently deal wit
such routines quite apart from the fact that there is nn facs
for storing the output of such functions.

I propose that the MIT system allow the use of functions
that produce several quantities as outputs and that it allow the
use of computer statements with the names of several quantities
on the left side. We give several examples.

l. X,¥= Y, X

Thls program interchanges Y and X. It 18 intended that
the values of the guantities on the right side at the time Just
before the execution of the statement be used for computing all
quantities on the left side. Thus this program compiles into
something different from the pair of FORTRAN statements

X =Y
Y=X

Sl X’Xag = X + ,.Y: SIN (Z): Y + COS(Z)

5. X1, X2, X3, X4 = F(X1,X2,X3,X4), X1, X2, X3

This illustrates a use for this kind of formula which might
be Important in the numerical solution of differentisi eguations
by Milne methods., ;

L, X,Y = F(A)

Here F 18 a function which produces two quantities from a
Single quantity.
