Dear Professor Morse:

I appreciate your interest, in the midst of what I know is a very
busy schedule, in continuing to build up communication between
university computation center leadership. I feel strongly that

there are at least two areas in which a strong stand taken by leaders
of various university computation centers around the country might
aid all of us.

The first of these is in the area of just what should a university
curriculum relative to computers consist of? I have strong feelings
myself as to standards of what is to be taught, but I particularly feel
that something formal needs to be done so that interested persons like
myself could point to some sort of national study group or committee
as a guide when proposing local changes. My experience at the
University of Michigan was that the conservatism of university

fa culties will prevent any growth of even high-caliber course work

in this area, unless outside help can be drawn on. A conference or
study committee in this area, sponsored by the National Science
Foundation, as to what sort of curriculum is needed in the area of
computer-oriented mathematics and surrounding fields, could mean
an immense amount to persons breaking their heads against adamant
university mathematics departments and university administrations.
(I do not mean to apply that I find such a situation here; in general, the
atmosphere is a very open-minded one; but Chapel Hill, because of
circumstance, may be an exception, and even so an external study
that could be drawn upon would be very useful. )

The second area, of course, is a discussion of the needs for equipment
and methods of supporting continuing research and teaching. Again,
