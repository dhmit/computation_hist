The CST card is most concisely described by defining a MEMORY
SYMBOL TABLE for translation time which 1s formed according to the
following rules:

(1) The MEMORY SYMBOL TABLE is cleared at the beginning of
translation time,

(2) A CST card with a blank variable field does nothing to
the MEMORY SYMBOL TABLE,

(3) A CST card with a non-blank variable field causes the
following steps to occur;

(a) The MEMORY SYMBOL TABLE is cleared unless a CST
card intervenes between the CST card just read and the last SAP, BIN, FTN,
or PMD card read,

(b) The MEMORY SYMBOL TABLE (which may have been
cleared in step a) and the symbol table mentioned in the variable field
of the CST card are combined to form a new MEMORY SYMBOL TABLE, The
title mentioned on the CST card must have been previously encountered
and a symbol table having the title must actually appear on the BINARY
INPUT TAPE,

(4) The direction cards, SAP and BIN, cause the following
steps to occur:
: (a) The MEMORY SYMBOL TABLE is cleared unless a
CST card intervenes between the SAP or BIN card just read and the last

SAP, BIN, FTN, or PMD card read.
(b) The MEMORY SYMBOL TABLE (which may be cleared in

step a) and the symbols assigned within the SAP or BIN deck are combined

to form a new MEMORY SYMBOL TABLE,

(5) The direction card, FTN,
d intervenes between the FTN card just read and the

clears the MEMORY SYMBOL TABLE

unless a CST car
last SAP, BIN, FTN, or PMD card read,

(6) No other direction card (e.g., PMD) affects the MEMORY

SYMBOL TABLE,

The MEMORY SYMBOL TABLE is recorded on the BINARY INPUT TAPE

whenever a SAP or BIN deck 18 assembled during translation time and is

associated with the deck.
