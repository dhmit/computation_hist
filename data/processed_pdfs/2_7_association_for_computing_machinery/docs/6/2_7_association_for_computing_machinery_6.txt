A method of computation for spherieal Bessel functions
of real and imaginary argument is given which is especlally
suitable for digital computers. The method involves the use of
recurrence relations with unnormalized values of the functlon.
The accuracy and convergence are examined and eriterion formulas
are given. A procedure based on the Wronskian is used to simplify
the final normalization.


SABERATY

When one attempts to solve 2 problem on a digital computer
one often finds Lit neceudary to furnish the machine with a great
sary values of some well-known analytic funetion, There ave essentially
two ways to do this. one technigue 1s to read the values from a table
of function values kept in internal storage during the computation.
Alternatively, the values of the function may be generated, as needed,
by the computer. In either ease, it is desirable to compute all
function values internally.

extensive use has been made of a function generator in
connection with the solutions of the spherical Bessel equation. It
tung out that in the case of these functions it is possible to

 

formulate a method of generation which 18 particularly well adapted
for machine ute, The method ds based upon the use of recurrense
ralations which are guite simple in form, thereby being easily coded,
and yet give high numerical sceuracy throughout the range of order

 

and argument met in most applications, The use of recurrence relations
implies, of course, that the method would be most efficiently utilized
in those caleulations where one requires the value of the funetion
for meny different orders at gach specified value of the arsunent.

The purpose of this paper is to show how the recurrence
relations may be used in a straightforward manner for generating
in a digital computer the various types of spherical Bessel functiond.


In particular, the problem of Starting the recurrence relations is
discussed from the viewpoint that a computer program must be able
to achieve a prescribed accuracy entirely from pre-established
criteria,

It 1s assumed that the required spherical Bessel functions
to be generated for a given positive value of x and the integral
values of n=0(1)N are one of the four types: § (x), n(x), 1,.(x) or
k (x).

Straightforward conalderations show that the upward use of
the three-term reeursion relations is numerically accurate for n, (x)
and k (x), Inasmuch as these functions for order 0 and -1 are
essentially elementary trigonometric and exponential functions »
starting the upward process offers no problem, Conversely for x
not large compared to N downward recursion is the only direction
numerically accurate for the functions J,(x) and 1 n(x). However,
instead of computing the funetion values for order N and Nel to start

 

the downward recursion, a speelal technique 1s used where the
recursion process is started at a higher order, )) » With the approxi.
mation 3 or " equal to zero and 3); -1 Or 1) 1 equal to unity.
Here the barred quantities are the unnormalized functions, The value
of J is chosen high enough so that the ratios of successive values

of : or 3. are accurate for all n less than or equal to HN,


the final normalization of the set of unnormalized 3,(x) or 1 (x)

Criterion will be given for the cholee of,) as a function of x,
Since the forms of Jo (x) and 1,(z) are elementary funetions,
Special normalization forms derived from

N and the accuracy desired,
the VWronskian can be used for further
