Dear Dr. Morse:

For some time this Center has been interested in the
application of certain mathematical and statistical models,
such as game theory, to the problems of personnel utilize-
tion in the military service. We are concerned with a
variety of problems which may be attacked with the use of
certain of these models.

An example of the sort of problem which we have in
mind is one of minimizing the cost of training Air Force
technicians. There are available psychological tests
which give a good indication of a man's probable success in
technical school training. These tests give differential
predictions for different kinds of training with concomitant
different probabilities of success. With these probabilities
and with good estimates of the cost to train men in each of
the several specialties, it is hoped that a minimizing pro-
ccdure might be used to indicate the most economical way of
assigning individuals to technical training, while at the
same time taking a minimum risk of not meeting the Air Force
requirements.

We are also interested in the application of general
purpose computers to the problems of personnel utilization,
particularly the solutions of mathematical models which might

be appropriate for personnel classification and training, es-
pecially methods of managing very large masses of data, which

considered separately have little predictive value, but which
considered as a whole, Permit good estimates of future per-

f ormance .
