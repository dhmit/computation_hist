Dear Philip:

I understand that you are chairman of the committee relating to the
meeting of the University Computing Laboratory Directors which occurred
last summer in Chicago.

T would like to bring to your attention a recent change in ACM bylaws
providing for special interest committees. Such committees are urged to
participate in the establishment of programs at national meetings, to
conduct symposia or other technical programs as interest merits, and to
advise and to collect and disseminate information (perhaps, via the ACM
Communications) concerning their field of interest.

Mr. Kenneth Kolence of RCA has been appointed chairman of a special
interest committee entitled "Computer Installation Management." The
relationship between this activity and yours would be for you to work out.

Tn any case, I feel that 1) the members of the association can benefit
by learning of the results of your thinking, 2) that many of the people
involved are already ACM members, and that 3) the ACM machinery for meet-
ings and publication may be of some benefit for you,

ely yours,
