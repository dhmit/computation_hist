Survey sample are re-interviewed in successive -onth-,l so that there are
records on Univac tapes which could reveal the labor force participatioa
of individuals over time, However, the information for aay simgle imndi-
vidual is scattered on many tapes so that extemsive and expemsive collating
would be required to collect the informatiom into usable form,

There is the continuous work history sample of the BOASI; but
only OASI covered employment is recorded and the demographic amsd economic
characterizations of individuals are very ckctchy.’

Somewhat more promising, but still hardly adequate for our
purposes, is the basic data umderlying the S8SRC study, Labor Mobility im
Six Cities, This comsists of interviews with a probability sample of 4400
women and 8543 men, In order to qualify as respondemts, the imdividuals
had to be 23 or over in 1951, had to be at work imn January of that year,
and had to have worked at least ome month in the decade 1940 to 19850,

The trouble with this data is threefold, In the first place, it is biased
because those who were not at work ia January 1951 are excluded, In the
second place, rather few of the demographic and economic characteristics

that we are iaterested in were recorded, And fimally, there is mo repre-

 

sentatiom of individuals living outside of six of the largest metropolitam
areas, It would seem then that the following strong cemclusiom of Jaffe
and Stewart is still essentially valid; "many persons emter amd withdraw
from the labor force several times during the course of a lifetime,.  The
requisite data for investigating this problem are mot availablo."’

Were it mot for the need to study the behavior of imdividual
decision-making units, we might rest content with estimating the propor-
tioms of individuals of given characteristics who are in the labor force
under givea circumstances, This, however, would neglect the rate of turmover
withia cells from moath to month and we know that there are eomsiderable
variatioms ia this between cells, In the case of some types of imdividuals,
such as adult males, those who are in the labor force during any givea
