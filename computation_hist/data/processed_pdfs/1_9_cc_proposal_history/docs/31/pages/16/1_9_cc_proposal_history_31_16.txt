The various groups of equipment in the laboratory may be used
independently or may be 1nter¢onnected as required for the

particular problem being studied.

Instrumentation Laborétory. The Mathematics Group of the
Ingtrumentation Laboratory has an electronic analogwcomputer
called REAC which was developed by the Reeves Instrument Corpora-
tion. REAC has seven integrators, and can therefore solve
ordinary differential equations up to the 7th order (or thres 2nd
order simultaneous ordinary differential equations). It also
has four servos which, although they are mechanical, permits
the machine to handle non-linear processes. One servo can,
for instance, perform three multiplications (or divisions)
with a single input. Resolvers allow for insertion of sine and
cosine functions. The machine has 24 scale factor potentiometers.
Solutions are recorded on input-outpﬁt tables.

Since the machine only takes from 30 to 60 seconds to solve
a problem once 1t has been set up, it 1s clear that most of the
time Involved in solving a problem is in setting it up, choeosing
a proper scale, etc. The use of boards on which problems can be
pre-patched illustrates its flexibility: by merely changing
boards, the machine can go from solving one problem to another
almost immediately. The accuracy 18 of the order of 2%.

The Group has availlable a smaller scale highuspeed
Electronic Analog Computer which seems somewhat similar to
the Macnee machine. This machine solves linear equations only,
but a 3000:1 time scale permits instantaneous solutions which

complement the 1:1 time scale (Toil second) involved in the
