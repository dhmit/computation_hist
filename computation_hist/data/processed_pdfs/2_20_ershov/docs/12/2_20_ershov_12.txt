Dear prof. Perlis:

I am very sorry but a lot of various events,one of which
was the birth of our second child - daughter,did not allow me
to answer your important letter immediatly.

I am greatly thankful and interested in your intention
to lnvite me in Carnegie Tech and give me a possibility to
vislt some other Centres.l should be very glad to visit United
States and meet with you and (if it will be possible) other
persons with whome I had made an acquaintance in England.

I should like to receive your official invitation as
soon. as lt 1s possible. Â©

I thank you for your books and hope to receive them
SOOM.

Looking forward to your early answer,

.

sincerely yours
