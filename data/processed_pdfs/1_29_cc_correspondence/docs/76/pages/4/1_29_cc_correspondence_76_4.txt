DEFINITION OF JCB

A job may be considered as the basic unit being processed by the
Monitor at any one time; it consists of one or more subprograms.
A job is either an Execute or non-execute job. An Execute job
is one to be executed immediately after whatever processing is
required; thus, the subprograms of the job are related to each
other. A non-execute job contains subprograms that need not be
dependent. Each program is processed as the control cards for
the job specify. The ''processing' that is given a subprogram

is one of the following:

EXECUTE Job Non-Execute Job
1. FORTRAN Compilation 1. FORTRAN Compilation
2. FAP Assembly 2. TFAP Assembly
3. Relocation of object (object program input

program input is simply ignored)
o

 

4, For jobs divided into
links, treatments of
chain links

A job may be considered as falling into one of the following

five types:

1. One or more FORTRAN source subprograms to be compiled.
This is simply multiple-compilation.

2. One or more I'AP symbolic subprograms to be assembled.

3. An intermixture of job types 1 and 2. This results in
multiple compilation and assembly of FORTRAN and FAP
source subprograms producing object subprogram output
for each source subprogram input. There may be any

combination of main programs and subprograns.

Execute Jobs

4. A sequence of input subprograms for immediate execution.
