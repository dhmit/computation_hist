Dear 81ir:

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology submlts
herewl th a proposal for extension of the reference contract to
June 30, 1957 at an additional estimated cost of $20,960.00.

Wa understand that this proposgl has been the subject of dlscus-
along between Professor FP. M. Morse of MIT and Mr. A. J. Wise

of ONR-MIT, Dr. Carl F. Mukenhaupt of ONR-Bogton, and Dr. FP. J.
Weyl of ONR-Waghlngton.

There Tollows & summary of expenditures and funds
repaining on the two projects, Whirlwind Operation and Machine
Methods of Computation, which are currently active under the
peference contract:

Project #6345 (Whirlwind Operation) has an unexpended
balance of $97,000 as of November 30, 1955, The current expend-
1 tures are approximately $10,000 per month, The average "income"
received Tor Whirlwind usage 1s approximately $3,000 per month --
a net expenditure of $7,000 per month. If 1% 4s assumed that the
present level of income (83,000 per month) 1s maintained during
the nineteen-month perlod December 1, 1955 to June 30, 1957, a
minimum amount, assumlng some tapering off, of $119,000 willl be
required during this period. |

Project #6915 (Machine Methods of Computation) has an
unexpended balance of %71,000 as of November 30, 1955. The current
expenditures are approximetely $7,000 per month. If it assumed
that the present expendliures remain constant, there will be a
balance of approximately $22,000 on June 30, 1956. In accordance
with our present plans for terminating the ONR support of this
project on June 30, 1956, there will be certaln additional term-
inating expenditures. IT is estimated that $7,000 will be
expended for termination purposes.

Thig summary is based on eatimates prepared bY Prof -
eggsor P. M. Morse.

Professor Morse further advises that the expected
arrival of an IBM Type 704 Electronle Data Processing Machlne at
MIT about January 1, 1957 will create a definite need for addl-
tional funds--to finance the conversion of existing Whirlwind
programs to Type 704 programs.

Reference: Contract N50ri-06001 DIC-#6345, #6915

Under the proposed plan submitted herewith, Project
#6345 (Whirlwind Operation) would terminate on June 30, 1957.
The task order for this period would include the usual Whirlwind
project activities:

1. Research in methods of numerical analysis and
the formulation of scientific problems for machine
solution, together with the tralning of personnel
in these methods.

2. Support of the Sclentific and Engineering Appllca-
tiong Group of Project Whirlwind so as to make the
computer useful and available for the above-mentioned
regearch.

In addition, it is proposed that the following task
order arising in connection with the Type 704 EDPM be included:

3. The development of a sultable interpretive program
and associated coding techniques to permit effective
implementation of the Type 704 machine.

It is anticipated that a separate project will be set
up to handle the Type 704 utilization within the MIT Computation
Center, and a separate request to the ONR Tor support of thls work
will be made in the near future. In this respect certaln
experienced programmers could be made avallable for transfer %o
this new task as of January 1, 1957. This anticlpated transfer
has been taken into account in the budget proposed for Project #6345.

The foregoing proposal does not take into consideration
termination costs which may be assoclated with the close out of |
this contract and the possible dlesposition of the Whirlwind Computer.

It is proposed to delay the submittal of any budget for this matter
until such time as disposition of the Whirlwind Computer is
determined.

The estimated budget for the period July 1, 1956 to
June 30, 1957 1s attached herewith as page 3.

Very truly yours,
