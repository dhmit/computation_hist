SAK Pirast use sets mode to octal
CLA 100 Address taken as octal 3
ADD /D/99 Address taken as decimal

TXL 146,4,/D/8 Address octal, decrement decimal
TXI /D/150,4,10 Address and decrement decimal

TXI /D/180,4,/6/10 Address decimal, decrement octal
TXI 180, ,/H/AB:C Address octal, AB in BCD, C is octal equivalence

RDF (Redefine), The RDF pseudo-operation can be used to redefine symbols
during compilation, When RDP is uged to define a symbol that is not previously
defined, it has the same effect as EQU. Any symbol which is redefined by an

RDF operation must be defined initially by an RDF operation,

Examples of the use of RDF will be given in section 17,

17. Examples using the IFPF Operation - Recursion

 

Recursive procedures are mormally programmed by means of a "loop"
using index registers to count amd to modify addresses, Macros cam be used
to compile such a loop extensively into the program, BSince mo counting or
address modification is necessary whem the loop is written out, time is saved
at run time,

Consider a macro CURSE (recursive) such that the macro call
MAC CURSE,OP,N

compiles the instruction sequence defined by a second mecro OP N times into
the program, ;

The above can be accomplished by defining MOP CURSE

NOP CURSE, OP M |

IFF M Assemble next instruction if and only if M0,

MAC CURSE(OP)M=-1 This CURSE macro is initiated before the previous
one is completed, The current status of the
previous macro is stored away in a pushdown list,

IFF M Skip MAC OP for M0.

MAC OP NM MAC OP will be carried out successively for
Hwl, 2, .osp N;

END CURSE

The status of successive macros CURSE with second arguments NyN-1,,..23,1
is stored im the pushdown list as indicated in Appendix 2, When an argument of 0
is reached, the uncompiled part of each of the above macres is expanded, This
gives rise to the expansiom of MAC OP,1 followed by MAC OP,2 and terminated by
MAC OP N,

For instance, the call
BAC CURSE,QOP,2

would expand as follows:
