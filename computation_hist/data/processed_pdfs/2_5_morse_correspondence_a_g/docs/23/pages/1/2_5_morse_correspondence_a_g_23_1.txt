Dear Mr. Lowe:

Thank you for your letter or November 1 com-
cerning the possibility of a talk on the appli-
cation of electronic computing equipment, for
interested students. As you may know, MIT has an
Interdepartmental Committee on Machine Computation
and Numerical Analysis under the Chairmanship of
Professor P.M. Morse of the Department of Physics.
Professor F.B. Hildebrand is one or the repre-
sentatives of the Mathematics Department on this
Committee and I am turning your letter over to
him with the suggestion that he discuss it with
the Interdepartmental Comittee. If that Committee

feels that it can arrange a talk of the type you
have in mind, Professor Hildebrand will write you

Very sincerely yours,
