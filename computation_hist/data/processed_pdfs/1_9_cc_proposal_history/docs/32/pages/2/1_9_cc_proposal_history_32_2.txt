4y, To build up a library of useful sub-routines for the
solution of often-encountered problems, to prepare instruction
manuals, lists of routines, tables of functions, etc., which will ,
improve and extend the utilization of computing equipment at M.I.T.
and elsewhere.

5. To participate in conferences and other Joint activi- \j
ties with staffs of other computation centers, so that knowledge '
of this rapidly changing field can be exchanged with other workers.

Organization and Budget - Part of the staff of this re-
search group should be members of various departments at the In-
stitute paid in part.from Computation Center funds, for helping
supervise its work, and in part by the departments for their
regular teaching assignments. In this way we can have available
guidance, initiative and knowledge from a variety of points of
view, and can also maintain close liaison between the Center and
the students and faculty of those departments which can wmost
effectively utilize digital computers. We will also require a
few senior, full-time staff wmembers, to maintain continuity of
effort, to help supervise research, to prepare the wanuals and
sub-routines mentioned in task 4, and to be on hand to advise users
of the Center as to best procedures. The Junior staff will be, in
part, the research assistants and assoclates supported by IEM funds.

The yearly budget for such a research group would be
roughly $100,000, broken down as follows:
5 Faculty members (1/2 salary, average of g4t,000 each) g 20,000
Y} Full-time staff members (average salary g7,000) 238,000

4 Full-time secretaries, editorial and administrative ‘
assistants (average salary g4,000 - 16,000

, g 64,000
approximate 40 per cent overhead . 26,000
g 90,000
Travel 4,000
Publication costs, expendable material, etc. 6,000

£100, 000

| Possible Financial Support - Since thalCenter wlll provide
an important educational facility, which will be used by wany In-
stitute students, a part of this budget should be provided out of
the Institute educational budget. 1In addition, a number of the re-
search laboratories and projects at the Institute, which will use
