Since the double-layer electrolytic tank has no bound-

ary error, equations applying to inﬁnite two»dimen-
sional media can be used. Perfused frog hearts were
placed in the center of this tank. If the resultant dipole
of the heart, M, makes an angle 0’ with the + X axis,
the potential Vi at a distance n along this axis is given
by

V] = M cos 9’

The potential V; at a distance I; along the positive Y
axis is

The value of 5’ is substituted in 1 or 2 to ﬁnd M. M and
9’ were found as a function of time during the ventricu»
lar complex for bullirog and leopard frog hearts. With
the anatomical heart axis along the 0" line, 6’ varied
between the limits —40° to +7o°. The order of magni-
tude of M max in the ‘frontal’ plane was 80 u A-cm for
the bullirog and 6 M A-cm for the leopard frogl As pre—
viously reported, M max = 1000 » Avcm for the human
heart (horizontal plane). (Supported by U. S. Public
