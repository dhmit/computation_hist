Professor Philip M, Morse, Director
Computation Center
M.I.T, room 6-109

Dear Professor Morse,
Plans for the meeting of college publicity here on
January 9 and 10 are proceeding smoothly, and I'm pleased
that we can count on showing those concerned with it the
Computation Center and the cooperative program with New
Ingland colleges. I have this down for 11:30 on Thursday
morning, January 9; we will have lunch at 1:15 at the

Faculty Club, so you have as long as until 1 o'clock if you
want it.

I shall try to hold attendance tc a small number, so that

you can handle the whole group together. To this end, I =0
think I should have a list of colleges which are now par- Se
ticipating in the cooperative program - and which have done

so and may soon do so again. Then before we let others

attend the meeting I can at least be sure that representa-

tives of these schools are accommodated. A

We'll be sending out preliminary information in about =a
week, and I'd be glad to have the list before then if it
an be arranged. Do you want me to send any other in-
ormation about the Computation Center to participants
at this stage, to save you some’ time next month?
