Extension of NSF 62940

 

{lane for Next Year

All or these projects, and more, will stretch the capabilities
and energies of the Computation Center staff. -He expect to add .
two more senior staff members this summer and hope to-persuade two 8
men now completing their Doctor's degrees to stay on in Junior ‘
staff members for a year or two. It is certain that moet'of the 1
research subjects outlined in our original proposal to NSF will \
be begun this coming year; it can be expected that the NSF portion ‘
of support for this work will reach the yearly rate of $35,000
as indicated earlier, and it is expected that this yearly mte ’
will continue at about the same level for several further years,
as was forecast in our original proposal (see Enclosure 3).

He therefore request that Grant NSF 029110 be extended to
June 30, 1958, with additional mnds or $13,000.
