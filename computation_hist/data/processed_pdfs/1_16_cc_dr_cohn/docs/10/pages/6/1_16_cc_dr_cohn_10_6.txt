Thus the juxtaposition of symbols 1’3 (whfre 0 S t S 2 and 8' belongs to
the four—group); will have meaning as a (ﬁght) operator on 4’ and W111 m
fact be isomorphic to the alternating group on four elements.
Now if we consider a module equivalent to a normal module, then for
every hypercomplex unit ail? (0 S j S 3), (of 21 above) We have three units
belonging to the new hypercomplex system, namely. Z’a)E (0 S t S— 2)‘ In
this manner the group (yr: of hypercomplex units In the enlarged system is
determined from the group (50 of totally positive units as follows (compare

Note that for r: 8 the fundamental units are shown as conjugates of a
single unit while r=4 does not occur, in accordance with the conclusion
of 22 above. In this way we obtain a group 65* whose multiplication rules
can be given as follows:

(23. 5) (Z‘ajE) (ZuakE’) = Z'WaiE'”

where E”= (EZ")E’ and ai=akZ‘“a,-Z".

Now, the only possible proportionalities that mix rows are those coming
from the group 6?“, i. e., based on units, for the cube of any element of (3*
is an element of 6}, hence based on a scalar unit. (See section 21).

to one in which three of the quantities P, Q, 13,5 are conjugates. (In the
exceptional case (I) is one of a set of r/2 again).

In the table [7, p. 832] we ﬁnd evidence of some of these cases for
r= 81 Case I corresponds to A2 = 148, while Case 11 (or its exception)
corresponds to the proportionality classes that occur by twelves (or by fours),
Note that the module for A2 = 196 is neither an ideal nor normal, yet the
correspondence “ by fours” means it must be proportional to a normal
module (with even a normal basis). The numerical work is being carried
much further than in Part I, but it will be the subject of a separate report.

25. Concluding remarks. In Part I, Section 2. a modiﬁed quadratic
simple continued fraction algorithm was outlined, It turns out to be more
conventional than ﬁrst thought, in fact it is equivalent to the continued
fraction algorithm with the “ mediant ” fractions thrown in. The geometrical
Construction given in 2 can be seen to be a variation of Smith’s construction
[10].

In Part III, the concluding portion, we shall treat the algorithm as a
means of discovering “ small norms” (analogously with the Pell Equation)
