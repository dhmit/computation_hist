Machine Design By Computer-Douglas Ross

Mr. Ross is attempting to use a human-toupnter system operat-
ing in real time for optimum design. This type of program not
only requires a huge amount of program to mateh the machine
to a human, but has a strong requirement for searching for
optima and communlicating back and forth. A problem with this
much of & requirement for both speed and information capacity
cannot at present be successfully time shared on the 704. 1In
addition to the large bloeks of time required, no other usefil
work can be-dono by the 70# while thowhnnnnwdoctlion is gov-
erning.

Machine Thinking-Dr's Teager, Barnote, et, al.

Many separate individuals and groups, not tied in with
the Artificilal Intelligence Project are working on problems
of Pattern Recognition, Machine Induetion and Analysis, and

Problem Solving by Machine. Although the approaches are
widely different, they all share a common requirement for
high speed, large immediate access memories, and large auxi-
liary storage requirements which make them relatively in-
efficient and non feasible on a T704.

Industrial Dynamics, O.R., Econometries, ete.-Dr's Pugh,

Barnett, et. al.
Problems of Nonlinear Programming, Scheduling, and

Industrial Dynamics are beconing larger, and consequently re-
quiring almost an order of magnitude increase in speed and
capaclity. Problems of Parametric Variation and "insight" by
requiring many fold lterations of already long procedures are
bound to make the situation even worse.

Education and Research-Dr. H. Teager
It is clear that the need for computation is growing

and spreading out at M.I.T. Its use as a classroom ad-
Junct, while as yet unproved, has definite possibilities.
