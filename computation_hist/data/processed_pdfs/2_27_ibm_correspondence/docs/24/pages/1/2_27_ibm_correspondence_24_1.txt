Dear Phil:

Letters have now gone out from Mr. Watson to the presidents of each
university regarding the appointment of IBM Research Associates and/

or Assistants. A check for the first semester stipends has been enclosed.

A check to Dr. Killian of course was included with the above.

In addition Mr. LaMotte has written a congratulatory note to each of the
appointees.

On or about January 1, I hope to receive a list of the business office people
and we will send the checks for the second semester directly to them.

Sincerely yours,
