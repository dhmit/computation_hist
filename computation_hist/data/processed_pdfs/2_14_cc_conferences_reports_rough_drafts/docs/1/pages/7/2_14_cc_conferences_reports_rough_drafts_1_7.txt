Application of Actual Computers

It was decided that the solution of the same simple
differential equation:

¥+ y%=1 with y(0) =0 Sa

on all four types of calculators: desk calculator, REAC, CPC,
and Whirlwind would be appropriate, Since the solution of this equa-. ...

1s an analytic function which may be evaluated with great accuracy,
1t served to provide a good basis for observing the advantages and
limitations of various computers.

Every student (either individually or in pairs) was allowed
to solve this problem on each of the four computers in speclally-
'arranged laboratory sessions. The entlre work: preparation of
‘machine diagrams, programming, machine set-up, a:..d machine solutiou
was effected by the student. Since the subject covered numerical
ahalysis in a very preliminary fashion, the student was aiso pro-
vided wilth certainlapproximation formulae which were required on
the digital machines.

Generally speaking, the laboratory sessilons were highly
satisfactory as they provided the student with a firm understanding
of the exact manner in which he had to instruct the computer to
perform his task. He soon learned that the computer did not "think"--
was not a brain -- but 2 tool which he could use quite effectively.

General Level of the Subject

This subject did not serve as a survey of all existing
computers. Although a number of lectures were presented which il-
lustrated most available commercial computers by means of lantern
slides, no pretense was made of evaluating the computers. Certainly,
no attempt was made to create a team of "professional programmers.”
Rather, the men were taught the fundamental prindple of operation
of the four computers. If anything, a deliberate effort was made
to emphasize the common sin prevalent among professional programmers:
"... spending hours rewriting programs which eliminate a single order,
