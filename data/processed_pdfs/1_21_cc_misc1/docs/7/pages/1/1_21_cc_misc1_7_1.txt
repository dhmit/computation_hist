MIT for the salaries of two machine operators and one key punch
operator. I feel that until the usage of the Computation Center by the
New England colleges can be shown to have reached something near
this maxinsum amount, that we would not be justified under the terms
of the contract in authorizing you to bill us for the salary of an
additional machine operator.

At such time as you at MIT feel that the demand for the
Computation Center has reached the point where an additional ghift
is necessary, then, under the terms of the contract, 1 think that we
could justify authorizing youwrbilling us for the salary of one additional
machine operator.

For the time being, there is a substantial amount of what
would normally be idlc time on the IBM shift and this time is being
made available to MIT and New England coileges in accordance with
aur mutual understanding that additional time on our shift is available
to you and MIT idle time is available to us. When we reach a point
where idle time on the IBM shift is not sufficient to take care of the
