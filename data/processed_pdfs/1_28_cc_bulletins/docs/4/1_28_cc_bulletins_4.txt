SUGGESTION

The Center suggests that you file these BULLETINS as
informal supplements to the Procedures Handbook.

COMPUTATION CENTER MEMORANDA

The following CC memos of general interest have been
released since the last BULLETIN. Copies may be obtained
in Room 26-142.

CC-167-4 Description of a Post Mortem Subprogram
(F2PM) For Use With the FORTRAN/FAP
Monitor System, Version 2

A modification of the write-up of the
Fortran II Post Mortem.

CC-180-7 Computation Center Version of the
FORTRAN /FAP Monitor Sys tem
An update of the list of differences

between the manuals and the system in
use at the Center.

CC-182-2 Common Programming Errors

A list of common errors made by users
of FMS,

CC-186-3 FORTRAN and MAD Format Specifications

A general description of the format
specifications used for input and
output in FORTRAN and MAD coded
subprograms.


REQUEST CARDS

Programmers who have special tapes to be mounted should
note that these tapes will be mounted exactly as they were
left from the previous run. That is, if they were to be
file protected at the end of the last run, they will be file
protected at the beginning of this run and if they were not
file protected at the end of the last run they will not be
file protected at the beginnning of this run.

Note that a file protected tape is one which can be
read, but not written, whereas a tape which is not file
protected can be both read and written.

TOURS

Starting October 4, 1962, a tour of the Computation
Center will be given every Thursday at 4:00 p.m. Persons
wishing to go on such tours should meet in Room 26-168.

SYSTEM NOTES

1. FMS users should not use the *LIBE card at the
Computation Center.

 

2. FMS users must always use the *DATA card when
execution is desired.

3. FAP programmers who use update can only use tapes
9, 11 and 12.

4, FMS users should not use DEBUG for PRINT, PUNCH, or
READ statements as it will not operate properly.

5. A new subroutine version of MADTRAN is available
in the open file in Room 26-058, It is described in CC-138.

6. A new version of tapeless (F2PM) is available in
the open files in Room 26-058.

7. The double precision and complex arithmetic sub-
programs are now on the FMS library tape.

8. The subprograms DISPLA and SCALE, PL@T, GRID have
been added to the FMS library tape.


FUTURE SYSTEM CHANGES

 

DEBUG will soon be available for use with double
precision and complex arithmetic. However, programmers
wishing to use it will have to recompile their programs.
CHECK THE SYSTEM BULLETIN BOARD IN ROOM 26-058 FOR THESE

CHANGES,

 

MATERIALS FOR COURSE USE

 

Manuals and coding forms to be used in conjunction with
a course should not be obtained in Room 26-153. Students
should make requests to their instructor who will obtain
the necessary materials.
