computer time you propose to allocate to thesis students in
the Nuclear Engineering Department during the 1960 second
quarter.

Listed below is the time requested by each student.
your initlial grant of time, and the redistribution of time
we have been able to work out after discussing each student's
situation with him and his thesis supervisor. If vou can do
80, we would like to have time allocated in accordance with
the last column given below.

This redistribution has been made possible by the
availabllity of funds from the U.3. Atomlc Energy Commission
wihich have been budgeted for purchase of computer time for
fuel-cycle work from GE at Lynn at commercial rates, and by
the willingness of two students, Messrs. J. M. Nelll and
N. B. McLeod, to accept the risks and ilnconvenience of
having thelr work done on a different, off-campus mmichine.
Time surrendered by Nelll and McLeod has been redistributed
as equably as possible to the other men, taking inte account
the status of thelr work and their need to finish their
theses this term.
