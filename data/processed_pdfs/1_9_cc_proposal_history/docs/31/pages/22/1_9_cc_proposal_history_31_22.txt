Whirlwind has been used to solve problems involving non-
linear parabolic partial differential equatlons, matrix inver-
sion, algebralc equations, trénscendental equations, combinatorial
problems, correlétipn functions, and synthesis problems in which

one has to make guesseé.ahd anquse them.

Computing Groups. 'Scattered throughout M,I.T. are various
desk computer groups which generally do work assoclated with
the group to which they are attached. These include the fol-
lowing groups:

(1) The Joint Comguiing Group which does work for the following
groups: R.L.E., Nuclear Science, Acoustics and Solid State.
There are 9 computers and 11 Marchants in this group which is
somewhat distinguished from the others in that they themselves
set up the problems given to them for machine computation.
(2)'The Numerical Analysis Laboratory has 21 desk computers
consisting of 15 Marchants, 4 Monrois, and 2 Fridens. In
addition, they have 2 Natlional Cash machines. At present, they
-héve 10 people working as computers, although the number is
usually somewhat larger.

(3) The Instrumentation Lavoratory Computing Section has availl-
able 10 Monroes, 9 Marchants, and 14 Fridens (3 of which are of the
hand-crank type). Some of the machines are on loan, but 28 of
them are used regularly by the 28 girls they have working for
them.

(4) The Aeroelastic and Structures Research Computing Section
