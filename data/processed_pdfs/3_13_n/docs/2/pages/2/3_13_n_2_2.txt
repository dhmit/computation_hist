dless to say, we are always anxlous to experiment with new

techniques providing it does not lnhm vtth thc ml heavy
work load.

Finally ©© answer the hard quutm. namely uhnt we would
require to be done to put SB into our Operator program, the
conjectured answer, which I am not authorized to promise, would
be along the touuinz lines. Ve would accept SB in our Operator
program if someone else did all the work and providing it was
only an additional feature rather than a replacement; further
it would be necessary that vory complete documentation m made
of all the installation ste Finally, it would be necessary
that the Center have complete ooutx-ol over tho final speciﬂ.cattm
of thz muuod SB.

I realize this sounds zri.- M mmblo, but from our

point of view, the offer of experimental usage is the only answer '
that we can make at thu time,

Sincerely yours,
