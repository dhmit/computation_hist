Dear Phil,

I spoke to Miss Hill yesterday afternoon and gave
him the message which I hope was relayed to you. I was
hoping you might call me this morning since I am leaving
today and shall be at the Institute of Mathematical
Statistics meeting in Washington, Shoreham Hotel from
December 26 to 30. Would you please get in touch with
Taub and give him your decision whether we should keep
the tentative reservation for Allerton House - it seems
an absolutely splendid place. You might also get in
touch with Dr. Walker at the American Mathematical Society
about their approval of the site.

er
Sorry to bothÂ§ you with this but I feel I ought
to have your O.K. before telling Taube.

Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
Sincerely yours,
Walter Freiberger
