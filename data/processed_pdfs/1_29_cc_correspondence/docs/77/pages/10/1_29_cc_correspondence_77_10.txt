LOCATION OP VARIABLE FIELD
ALPHA TRA *4+2

is equivalent to

ALPHA TRA ALPHA+2

and represents a transfer to the second location following
the location containing the transfer instruction. There
is no ambiguity between this usage of the asterisk and

the use of the asterisk to denote multiplication, since
the position of the asterisk within the expression always
makes clear what is meant. Thus "**10" clearly means ''the
current value of the location counter multiplied by 10."
("**10" would be a relocation error by itself, but expres-
sions like "R1*11-%%10" or "**10-R1*10'" are permissible,
and are often useful in constructing tables.) Note: The
expressions '**'" and "*-*" are both absolute expressions

whose value is zero.

An expression if Boolean if and only if it forms an '"octal"
subfield of the variable field of a VFD pseudo-operation,
forms the variable field of a BOOL pseudo-operation, or
forms the variable field of a type-D machine operation.

(The type-D machine operations are SIL, SIR, RIL, RIR,

IIL, IIR, LNT, RNT, LFT, and RFT.) In a Boolean expression,

" LA " "
’

the four operators: + , x" and "/" have Boolean

meanings rather than their usual arithmetical meanings,

as follows:

Y CiorY - "1nelusive oxr', "='" ("exclusive or'", "symmetric
union'') difference")
0-(-0:0 0—0‘20
