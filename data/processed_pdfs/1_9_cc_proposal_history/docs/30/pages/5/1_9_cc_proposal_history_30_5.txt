Therefore, the computing machine re irements £
training and educational research at the Inat;‘:ute are foror
a small battery of machines, punched-card and electronie digi-
tal, with ancillary equipment, plus a staff of 6 to 10 full-
time coders and operators (amd perhaps maintenance men) and
part of the time of 2 or 3 faculty members. This should be
financed so that it will not have to charge for each use of
the machines. Of course, if some project wished to have :
some computations done and there were time available after
educational needs were satisfied, the project should be '
charged for the machine time it uses, and the money thus :
collected could go into a reserve fund, either to lighten :
the financial load carried by the Institute or else to be 5
used to purchase new equipment. But the financing should be \
adeguate enough so that educational and general research use
can be free, sc that priorities in scheduling machine time
can be decided on the merits of the work rather than on the
ability to pay for the time.

Equipment of the sort mentioned is here at the-
Institute now, but is not financed or organiged so as to
satisfy the educational needs outlined in this Report. Some
of the simpler IBM equipment is here as part of the Office
of Statistical Services, to handle the mechaniged part of
the Institute's record-keeping. The 605 and CPC is also a
part of the 0ffice of Statlstical Services, but the remtal
for these machines is paid entirely by a number of projects,
wvhich use most of the working time of machines and staff.
If they were to be used in whole or im large part for labora-
ory courses and for educational research, some other way of
financing their rental would have to be worked out. At
present, two minor pileces of 1IBM equipment have been assigned
to the Institute, rent-free, for educational use. By them-
selves, they are entirely inadequate for the educational
program we will have to provide. But it is possible that
M would be willing to donate enough more machines. rent-
free, to make this a useful instructional unit. In such a
case, the Institutec would onlw have to finance the m=laries
of the service staff. ~

Whirlwind I would be suitable !for the high-speed
part of the combination. Another possiBility would be an
IBH 701, which we do not have at present. If WVhirlwind were
to be kept for educational use, the service staff would have
to be augmented by two or three maintenance technicians and
would have to be still larger if the punch-card equipment were
in a different location from Whirlwind. This additional cost
would be smaller than the rental on an IBM 701, however, so
it would not be advisable to get a 7Ol for educational use
unless it could be gotten rent-free.
