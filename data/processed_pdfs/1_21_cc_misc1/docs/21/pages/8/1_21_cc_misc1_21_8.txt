~ Anticipating the turning over of Whirlwind to Lincoln, no
::dit::mi?on wore requested for NSori-60 for this fiscal year. Much
Wiri. Vity under this contract has been related to closing out the
'tm :art of the work, though some research started on Whirlwind has

th.b“ﬂ'ol‘:nt erred to the 704 in order to reach satisfactory completion of
i ml‘ - Because of the tapering-off of activity under this contract,
Toss appears that about $30,000 will still be unexpended by June 30,

» It also appears 1ikely that some of the more long-range research

Projects of the sort, supported by this contract in the past, will still
be going on, :

For example, cosmic-ray measurements and particle accelerator
Deasurements, carried out in the Laboratory of Nuclear Science, are
coming to use digital computers to analyze the data, We have been
cooperating with them to investigate methods whereby such measurements
can be recorded directly on cards or tape and programmed so that the
analysis can be carried out directly by the machine without further
manual transcription of data. This work will continue, as will the
investigation of various means of displaying the results of the machine
calculations. Other long-range investigations, such as that on
artificial intelligence, also come within the scope of the task orders
for NSori-60, :

, It is therefore proposed that the Office of Naval Research be
requested to continue Contract N5ori-60 for the year beginning July 1, 1958,
without additional funds, to continue support of long-range research of the
sort described in the Coatract's present task orders until the balance of
the funds is exhausted. These funds would be used chiefly for personnel
salariea and might be allocated as follows:

Senior Mathematician (1 year) $ 9,000
2 Technicians or Programmers 11,000

(at about $5,500 per year each) m
Overhead, at 45% 9,000
Travel 500
Incidentels (production of reports, - 9500

office supplies, etc.)

TOTAL $30,000

If the unexpendod balance on June 30, 1958, turns out to be less
or more than the ostimated $30,000, this budget could be modified accordingly
to run for a shorter or longer time than an additional year,
