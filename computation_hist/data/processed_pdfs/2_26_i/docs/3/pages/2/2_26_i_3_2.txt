In order to discuss this in a more detailed manner, we propose to
convene a meeting of representatives of Corresponding Institutions at /
the occasion of the International Conference on Information Processing,
which will be held at Hugggp, Paris, 15—20 June, 1959, and where all éi‘“
Corresponding Institutions will certainly be represented. This special )
meeting will be held on Monday, June 22, at Unesoo House, and we very _
much hope that you or another member of your staff will be able to attend
this discussion. In the meantime, it would be very useful if you could

start sending us news, along the lines suggested above, for circulation
through our Bulletin.

‘We are sending you, under separate cover, a copy of Bulletin No. 1
which contains a questionnaire for the International Repertory of Compu-

tation Laboratories and we would appreciate it if you would kindly fill
this out and return it to us.

Yours sincerely,
