Dear Fresldent :

 

It is with great pleasure that I am able
to invite the participation of your institution in a note-
worthy new research Â»rogram at Massachusetts Instltute of
Technology.

The International Business Machines Cor-
poration, through ite President, Mr, Thomas J. Watson, Jr.,
has generously offered to install at the Institute a Type-704
Electronic Computing Hechine, thelr largest hlgh-speed research
computer, with the understanding that all the colleges in New
England may share in 1ts use. Dellvery of the machine will
take place in about one year,

The intention of Mr. Watson ls to provide
fecilitlies for fundamental research ln sclence, engineering,
applied business and the new field of data processing and for
the training of personnel in computer operation, No classl-
fied work will be done and research must be of a non-routine
nature, contributing to basic knowledge, The plan now being
considered provides that up 0 seven hours a day of macnine
time will be avallable for particlpating colleges other than
M. 3. T.

The equipment 1s to be lncorporated lnto
an M.I.7T. Computation Center, with Frof. Phillip M. Horse as
Director. 1.B.M. will provide a malntenance staff and has
kindly offered funds for the support of as many as twenty
research assistants, up to half of whom will be appointed
from other educational institutions, to undertake research
in the utilization of high-speed computers. However, opera=-
ting staff cosets will have to De shared by the users,

Most effective utilization of the macinlne
might be achieved if, as a partial contribution for staff
support, each participating lnstitutlion could assign one or
more members of its faculty to spend sufilclent time at M.I.T.
to learn to operate the machine and to supervise the prograim-
ming of problems, These representatives of the institutlons
could consult with other members of thelr faculties on projects
for the computer,

We propose to form an Advisory Commltitee,
with representation from other colleges, whlch would work
with the Director on such matters ae schedullng, priority, and
the types of problems which should be submitted,


-
Tals paragraph 1s
to be sent only to
a selected list of
universities. Otiner-
wige it is to be
omitted.

If your institution is interested in
utilizing the facility, we would hope to have one member of
your faculty on the Advisory Committee, After details of
plang are worked out with I.B.M. I will invite you to a
meeting at which formal disclosure of the grant will be made,
but meanwhile I would appreciate a suggestion from you as tO
an appropriate representative on the Advisory Commlttee for
an initial period of time.

I hope very much that your institution
will be able to participate in use of the computer and 1
look forward to being advised of your interest. Public
announcement of the grant will be made in the near future.
