The following four subjects are the only Institute subjects wvhich make
active use of electronic digital computers for classroom teaching:

6.25 Machine -Aided Analysis )

6.5356 Introduction to Digital Computer Coding and Logic
6.5638 RBlectronic Computational Laboratory

16.91 Aerocelasticity

A proposed subject in Management Information Systems is to be given in the
8chool of Industrial Management (8.1.M.) for the first time in the Spring

Term 1958. This subject will illustrate the use of digital computers as a

tool of busincess manggunent. A list of relatsed subjects which make occasional
use of the facilities is given in Appendix (page v). Naturally, such participa-
tion would beo meterially increassed if equipment were available on a gratis basis.
