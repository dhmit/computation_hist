Dear Professor Morse:

Many thanks for your letter of October 30 and the attached
application which we had discussed here orally some weeks ago and,

subsequently, rather brieﬂy by ﬁephone.

I expect to be in Cambridge on other matters on November 8
and until early afternoon on November 9. Would it be at all possible
for me to see you during my visit? I find the statement of the pro-
ject quite clear and straightforward. All the same, I would hope that
perhaps a few minutes with one of your assistants might give a sense
of concreteness to W understanding of this proposal which, so far, has
been obtained entir ely orally and from reading.

I should like also to raise with you the item of overhead at
20 per cent included in your budget. You are probably aware that this
Foundation has a strong working rule against the inclusion of any flat
percentage for overhead, except in the very rare case where the Foun-
dation itself has in effect taken the initiative in a. project. The
word overhead, however, has a wide variety of connotations and I think
it might be helpful if we could discuss it together.

I expect to check into the Commander in Cambridge on Wednes-

day night and, if you find it more convenient, you could leave word for
me there.

Sincerely yours,

. //'
