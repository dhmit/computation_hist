Dear Professor Feshbach:

I have been authorized to credit your account with 10 additional
hours of machine time on the Whirlwind I computer for work under problem 225,
Neutron-Deuteron Scattering.

You might be interested to know that since your problem began,
you have used (as of November 4) 1,321.6 minutes of machine time. If you
had been charged at the regular rate of $250/hour, the total amount charged
to your account would have been $5,507.11.

If you find that you need more time, it will be necessary to
submit a new request.

Sincerely,

F. M Verguh
