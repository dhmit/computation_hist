's CONJECTURES ON CRITICAL LATTICES IN

of 24+ 1=2(1— 1s Ei other parts of which have been recently djs.

This brief article contains a disc

some conjectures of M

prog ski [2] showed, on the basis of a general theorem on convex bodies,
ow :

—~ ; ini area of the simple infinity of parallelo-
that ¢, = 7 i ie Fo ori and the other three vertices of which
fee So ler P| n° = 1. Turning his attention to the inscribed paral-
we © Minkowski first conjectured, in effect, that the minimum and mag;-
mum areas would occur at the symmetric positions, i.e., when the parallelogram
has a vertex on the £ - (or 5 -) axis or on the line £0 (or § = — 5). We
shall prove this conjecture to be false, (see 4), for certain small ranges of p and
to be true, (see b), for sufficiently large values of p. Minkowski went on to make
the second conjecture that the minimum parallelogram will have a vertex on the
line = 9 (or § = — 1) when p > 2, while it will have a vertex on the & - (or
n-) axis when 2 > p > 1. Mordell [3] verified both these conjectures in the case
p = 4, while Davis [1] disproved the second conjecture for values of p suffi-
ciently close to 1 and 2.

We shall also consider the question of when the symmetric parallelograms
provide relative maxima and minima, since this matter has bearing on the con-
Jectures when p is not large, and, in particular, it provides our proof that the
optima (and the critical lattices associated with them) do not necessarily par-
take of the obvious symmetries of the metric. This, of course, contradicts Min-

kowski’s first conjecture. Qur main result, however, is a proof of Minkowski’s
first and second conjectures when p is sufficiently large.’

(4)

We first verify that if the base of the parallelogram is rotated from one of these
positions to the other, then each position, within symmetries, will be assumed by
one of the three vertices lying on the curve |£[" + | 7° = 1. In fact, the base clearly
takes all slopes between 0 and 7p , the opposite vertex takes all slopes between
— 0p and — 1 while the included vertex takes all slopes between o, and 1/7, .
By symmetry, these slopes cover all values between 0 and 1. Hence it is no
fundamental restriction to confine ¢ to the interval gp = 0 2 1, (or to make the
corresponding restriction 0 < r < 7,. As for the size of these intervals, when p
goes from 1 to «, ¢, goes from 1 to 2, while = goes from 3 to 0. At the same
time, from simple convexity properties, A,(s, 7) increases monotonically in p for
fixed ¢ and r with A(r, 0) = 4, Ay(7, o)= 34/3, and A4(7, ¢) = 1, for all ¢ and 7.

result to be false. Then a subsequence of values of p exists which tends to infinit
and which permits equations (2) and (3) to be satisfied by a ¢ and lying Se
the open intervals just mentioned. We find it convenient to select a still a
subsequence for which the values of ¢ fit the description of one of the cases listed
in the adjoining table. By referring each case to equation (2), we find the asymp-
totic relationship thereby implied between o and r. These results are listed &
the next column of the table. Now using this information, we can calculate the
asymptotic value of the left hand member of equation (3), (which supposedly
holds). But these values, listed in the last column, are easily seen to be nop.
hence the proof by contradiction is complete.
