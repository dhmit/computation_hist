PROPOSAL FOR RESEARCH INTO THE EFFECTS
OF AUTOMATIC CONTROL AND MACHINE PROCESSING OF OPERATING DATA ON
SOCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL OPERATIONS

We propose to study the effects of automatic control
techniques and computing devices on social and industrial opera-
bions,by closely coordinated research in three ma jor directions:

1. Case studies of the possibilities and consequences
of "automation" in several carefully chosen industrial and govern-
mental operations. Each case would be studied by a mixed team, drawn °
from a variety of disciplines. The operations studied would be
actual ones, a factory or a store or a part of a government service,
so specific operating data will be obtainable and so’ that the prac-
tical difficulties will be apparent; general principles can be
built up inductively from the results of several such studies.
These’ studies would have to be carried out with the close coopera-
tion of the administrators of the operations studied.

2. Research into the techniques of automatic control and
into the use of machine processed data, and experiments with the
use of various input and output equipment. This research can be
carried on in cooperation with the Institute's new Computation
Center and would utilize the interest and kriowledge of those members
of the Institute staff who are already doing research in this area.
The results of this broader research activity would provide new
suggestions for application in the case studies of (1) and the
problems arising from the case studies would suggest new techniques
and equipment to investigate.

2. Quantitative analysis of the dynamics of social and
industrial operations by the techniques of operations research.
This research would develop the mathematical theory which would be
utilized in the specific applications studied in parts (1) and (2).
Regularities in the operating data obtained from the case histories
could be used to extend the theory and extensions of the theory
could help guide the case studies and the equipment development.

Close cooperation would be insured between the three
parts of the project by frequent conferences and by occasional
transfer of staff from one part to another. Each part would be
staffed by a few full-time staff members, by a number of interested
members of the Institute faculty, each contributing a portion of
his time, and by half-time research assistants chosen from the
graduate students of all departments. Each of the three types of
" staff members will be necessary: the full-time research associates
to carry on the administrative details of the project and to main-
tain continuity of effort; the faculty members to contribute their
varied background of knowledge and to transmit the knowledge gained

in the project back to the new generation of scholars via the
faculty teaching; the student members to contribute freshness of
point-of-view and to transmit the knowledge gained by the project
to industry and government when the students complete their gradu-
ate work and find Jobs. / :

The project as a whole will have an over-all supervisor,
presumably a senior member of the SIM staff, advised by a steering
committee of representatives of the various parts of the project.
Parts (2) and (3) will have heads and each case study group will
need a head. These directors should be Institute faculty members,
backed up by one or more full-time research associates. The rest
of the staff of the project would be other faculty members and
the research assistants. :

Funds will be needed for the salaries of the full-time
research associates, to reimburse the departments for the diversion
of part of the time of the faculty staff members from their usual
teaching duties to work for the project, and to pay the stipends
of the student research assistants. Travel money must be avail-
able, a few secretaries and technicians will need to be hired and
some equipment must be bought each year, particularly for part (2).
Space must be found in the Institute for the project, some space
near the computation center, some space in the Sloan building and,
perhaps, a small amount elsewhere.
