APPROACH TO MARKOFF’'S MINIMAL FORMS
THROUGH MODULAR FUNCTIONS

HARVEY COHN

The author considers # a sub-group of the modular group of genus one
corresponding to a fundamental “parallelogram” with rational vertices in the
upper half-plane. Such a group .# of linear transformations is actually deter-
mined to within similarity. If 4 and B are “generating” substitutions, (identi-
fying opposite sides), then A BA—1B~! is equivalent to the substitution z’= 2-4-6
and the fixed-point of 4, are roots of Markoff’s minimal forms. This can be
shown by combining identities of Frobenius, (Uber die Markoff Zahlen, Preuss.
Akad. Wiss. Sitzungsberichte, (1913), pp. 458—487), with identities of Fricke,
(Uber die Theorie der automorphen Modulgruppen, Nach. Ges. Wiss. Gottingen,
(1896), pp. 91—101). This method can be modified to produce classes of forms
with a minimum close to one-sixth (rather than one-third) of the discriminant.

The matrices in # taken by themselves are of some interest since every
denominator in the modular group must occur in the corresponding linear
fractional substitution. Sample generators of # are 2’ = (z + 1)/(z + 2),
z= (z—1)/(—=z + 2), 2 = (32— 1)/2, etc. The fundamental domain can be
described in invariant fashion by the period parallelogram of the #-plane for

T() = [4] = 430) + 1.

APPROACH TO MARKOFF’S MINIMAL FORMS
THROUGH MODULAR FUNCTIONS

By Harvey Conn!

(Received March 26, 1954)

1. Introduction

In 1879, Markoff 7, 3° derived, by means of continued fractions, an infinite
sequence of integral indefinite binary quadratic forms whose minima are greater
in absolute value than one-third the square root of the discriminant. The method
of continued fractions provides probably the most direct approach and was
used even more intensively as the subject of diophantine approximations de-
veloped [6]. Nevertheless, a parallel development was started by Frobenius
[5, 2] in 1913, using properties of quadratic forms. In between, however, in
1896, Fricke [4] had considered groups of substitution matrices generating
fundamental domains of genus one in the upper half plane. In setting up group
generators, Fricke had made use of identities of the type:

(1.1) S(A4) + &(B)’ + S(4B)’ = &(4)S(B)S(AB) + S(ABA'B™") + 2
and
(1.2) S(BAB) + &(4) = S(B)S(AB),

where A and B are real unimodular matrices and © is the trace. The verifica-
tion of these identities is straightforward, (compare [1, pp. 472, 481]), yet the
close resemblance of these identities with Markoff’s equation and its recursion
formula, (equations (5.5) and (5.3 bis) below), seems to have somehow escaped
notice.

In this treatment, we give a new derivation of Markoff’s minimal forms, char-
acterized by arithmetic restrictions on Fricke’s problem.

 

 

2. Fundamental Domain
We start with a fundamental domain of genus one in the z-plane belonging to
some group G with a specific representation in r sal unimodular linear substitu-
tion matrices, denoted as follows:

A= 5 B = etc,

The last two recursion formulas are known, however, [3, p. 104], to connect all
solutions of equation (5.5) with the smallest solution [1, 1, 1], by “descent”.
(It will be no loss to assume the traces to be positive). Hence in particular we

8. Final identification
We now restrict the m
satisfying the property:

(8.1) B7A7'BA = K,

caning of 4, B to any two integral unimodular matrices

(where k = —6).
From the discussion of §6, (equation 6.3),

(8.2) an = ©(4)/3(= a).
Thus since an = —ax (mod a) and ua» = 1 (mod ay), (by the definition of

trace and determinant respectively), we find that the value of a¥, defined in
(7.6) is an integer and the forms in equation (7.8) and (7.9) are equivalent in
the usual arithmetic sense.

To make use of the commutator property (8.1), we note that

(83) BAB = AK = [9 an

— ay 6a — awn

and we obtain from it the form

(8.4) $b r-1(2, y) = — [an + (a2 — an)zry — apy] + Gaxzy — Gay’.
Hence,
(8.5) an® x-1(x, y) = —an®a(z, y) + 2S(A)yy"

= —a®a(2", y").
Thus it follows that the four forms

8.6) + + NY + S(A)yy"

are all equivalent. (Frobenius used the matrix F in precisely this way but he did
hot derive the forms from the simple commutator relationship, or for that mat-
ter from the fixed-points of matrices). :

This period parallelogram, regardless of the exact choice of B,, has A, as one
side, and to it, under the mapping (9.1), correspond infinitely many well-deter-
mined quadrilateral fundamental domains in the z-plane. But by the definition
of generating matrix we must select only those with « as a vertex. They are all
related to one another by the translations z — 2X‘. Hence letting A* denote
some one of the matrices K ‘AK’ we find that the corresponding quadrilateral
fundamental domain must contain a side « ©*". This determines the fraction

are chosen to have trace 3, but under this notation

nerating matrices
(These ge g tal domain of Figure 2 is generated by the pair 4"

the quadrilateral fundamen
and [CV]7).

We consider the general generating matrix A for this group and the corre-

sponding form &,(z, y). From Part IT it follows that a matrix exists of trace
equal to three times any Markoff number, a, (see §5), and with lower left-hand
element ay = ©(4)/6 = a/2, (compare equation (6.3)). Once we shall have
shown that the (non-zero) minimum of | ®, | is ©(A4)/6, we shall have forms
analogous to Markoff’s forms.

11. Closure

Despite the fact that the matrices have fractional elements, we should still
want the forms ®,(z, y) to be ultimately restricted to integral x and y so that the
“minimum” may have its usual meaning. To begin with, however, we must let
(z, y) vary over a larger set, namely the lattice £ consisting of all couples (x, 9)
for which x 4+ y and x — y are integers.

Consider the following parity-property of a matrix A: The property is that the
rows on addition and subtraction yield integers of like parity, i.e., an + ax and
an + ax are (integers) of like parity while a;; — as; and a; — ax are also (in-
tegers) of like parity, (although the parities of these sums and differences will
not all necessarily agree). Now obviously 4A”, BY”, ¢”, and E have this prop-
erty. They furthermore form a basis of the matric algebra generated by g"
over the integers, (since the product and quotient of these four matrices in any
order 1s seen to be expressible as a linear integral combination of them). Thus, in
particular, any matrix of the group g* has the parity property.
