the computing equipment to an appreciable extent, and which will . =
depend on our research group to help them in their use of the e =
Center, should provide a yearly subsidy for this work. These con- -
tributions might add up to as much as 30,000 a year; the rest of

the funds wust come from special grants for this work. ';

Both the ONR and the NSF are interested in supporting f
research in the use of computing wachines and I propose that we | *
ask for 35,000 a year from each, to support our program. The
ONR has been supporting Whirlwind and its use in scientific re-
search, to an amount of $200,000 a year for several years; this
request will represent a substantial reduction in cost to them,
with no reduction in the amount of research which we will be turn-
ing out. The NSF is particularly interested in the field of com- :
puters and their scientific application; their special advisory :
committee, headed by Dr. von Neumann, has recommended support of ‘
research in this field. If their budget 1s increased for next '
year, they should be able to contribute.

I would hope that this support could be continued for
three to five years. A research group will need to be continued, |
at the Computation Center, for as long as the Center exists, of
course. But as time goes on, the research it does way well be-
come more speclalized, so that support can be obtained frowm other
sources. Certainly at the end of three years the work should be
reviewed, to re-determine its directlion and scope.

Recommendations - I recommend that one or more DIC
projects be set up for this research group, starting July 1, 19563
starting at a low rate of expenditure (perhaps 1/2 the full rate)
to prepare for the 704 operation, to have ready program techniques
and research plans and to supervise the first group of IBM research
assistants. By January 1, 1957, when the 704 is to be installed,
we can take over the Whirlwind research staff and go ahead at full
strength. I recommend that we request §25,000 apiece from ONR and
NSF for the first year's operation and indicate to both that we
will need a total of about g100,000 apiece from them for three
years of operation. I also recommend that procedures be worked
out so that other DIC research projects, which are going To use
the facilities of the Center for research or educational work in
conforming with the requirements of publishability and quality
specified in our agreement with IBM, can contribute to the support
of the research group. It is possible, as the use of the Center
by other universities increases, that some of this support will
come from projects in these other institutions.
