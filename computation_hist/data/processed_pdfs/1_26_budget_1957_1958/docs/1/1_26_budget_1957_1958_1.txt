REVISED BUDGET PRO FOR THE HIT COMPUTATION CENTER

a ————————

 

-

1.0 Introduction

The purpose of this report is to prepare a revised estiamate
of the budget requirements of the MIT Computation Center for the fiscal
period 1957-1958, This revised report is being prepared at the request
of Mr, Cusick, Comptroller, since the previously-submitted ‘gray folder
budget’ is reported inadequate,

On January 23, 1957, a preliminary budget estimate (memorandum
CC-11) was prepared and used as a basis for the above-mentioned budget
which was submitted to Professor Floe., Since that time the Computation
Center has assumed physical form and the 704 computer is currently
being operated on a two-ghift basis. Accordingly, tho space on the first
and second floors of the Karl T, Compton laboratories have been ocecupied
by the Center staff, much of the office equipment in this area has been
installed, and the Center is well on its way to assuming its final form.
As a result, succesding sections of this report contain a more-accurate
indication of the actusl cost required for budgeting purposes.
Specifically, a description is given of the estimated budget requirements,
a detsiled breakdown of the IBM machine complement in the Center, a
detailed breakdown of salaries and wages, an analysis of potential income
to the Center, a discussion of several research projects -- National Science
Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, etec,, 2nd some comments regarding the
method of cost allocation which is to be used in the Center, Finally, a
summarizing appendix provides an indication of the various contributions
made by the IBM Corporation.

Estimated Budget Requirements for the Fiscal Period 1957-1958,

There are many expense items wich are normally associated
with the operation of the Computation Center. Of necessity, certain of
these expenses are one-time charges, notably those associated with office
furniture, space modification, office equipment, etc, These are segregated
for purposes of clarification,

Table I summarizes the principal items of cost which may be
encountered in the Computation Center during the next fisal period.
Certain of these exponditures are fairly accurate because of their basic
character, On the other hand, other expenses are somewhat uncertain because
of the unforseen expenditures which may arise because of our occupancy of
new quarters, new installation and now "modus operandi’ associated with {he
operation of the Center,

2.1 Detailed Breakdown of IBM Machine Complement

Table II provides a listing of the type, quantity, description,
and monthly rental costs of the various machines which are normally
referred to as the Type 704 Electronic Data Processing Machine -- a total
of thirty-one (31) individual machines,

Table III provides a detailed breakdown of the type, quantity,
description, and monthly rental costs of the auxiliary Electric Account ing
Machine equipment which is used in conjunction with the 704 Calculator. |
These machines are located in the basement of the West wing -- in R., 28-058,

It is apparent from Table II and Table III that IBM's contribution
in machine rental amounts to § 45,460 per month or $545,520 per year,

2.2 Detailed Breakdown of Salaries and Wages

The acturl distribution of the present and proposed salaries
and wages for the staff of the Center is given in Table IV. This table
indicates the monthly salary, the annual salary, and the project
allocation essociated with sach individual currently on the payroll,
It should be menticned that there will undoubtedly be some changes in
this personnel complement during the year occasioned by normal terminations
and new additions to the staff, A further attempt was made to segregate
personnel who are basically part-time in character -- individuals such
as Hildebrand, McCarthy, 280s who joined the Center staff only during
the summer months,

3.0 Analysis of Potential Income for the Center

3.1

For the sake of the record, it should be mentioned that the
present personnel complement im the Center has been obtained primarily
from two sources: former staff members in the Office of Statistical Services
and the former staff of the Digital Computer Laboratory. Succeeding
sections of this report briefly describe these former projects and
emphasize the available funds which currently exist in the operating and

. Teserve Bogounts associated with these two groupe,

Funds Available in Statistical Services Accounts

The Office of Statistical Services was formally established
in June of 1950 to perform the following activities:

i, Perform scientific computing for the MIT family,

2, Mechanize the office procedures in various administrative
offices,

3. To perform educational training and research in new
computing methods,

Effective July 1, 1987, the scientific computing, educational training,
and research in computing mothods activities were transferred from
Building 20 into the Computation Center, The administrative mctivities
will continue to be performed in Building 20, As a result of this
segregation of activities it is important, from the financial standpoint,
to indicate the status of the various operating and reserve accounts
associated with Statistical Services, Table V summarizes the operating
and reserve accounts in Statistical Services at the end of each fiscal
period. It is apparent from this table that effective July 1, 1957 there
is $-=555.38 available in the operating account 2935 and $24,003.63
available ir the reserve account 2789,

. Since the Computation Center is continuing to provide the
tollowiag services:

1) Scientific computing for the MIT family,
2) Educational training of staff and student body,

3} Research in new computing methods for the entire
HIT family,

it is logical to Pequest that some of the remaining funds in the former
Statistical Services accounts be used as pert of the operating budget of
the Computation Comter. Indeed this has been done and $12,500 was
appropriated from the regorve account 2789, and set up as an account to
provide furniture and equipment for the new Computation Center, There
are additional expenses which have been and will be incurred during the

. next figcal period. Additional funds bave boon requested for this purposc.

3.2 Available Funds in Existing DSR Project 6345

3.3

The need of the MIT family for & high-spesd compuiler has bean
satisfied during the past five years by the use of the Whirlwind Computer,
Specifically, the Digital Computer Laboratory group -- under the direction
of'F., M., Verzuh, has operated the Whirlwind Computer for use by the MIT
family Zor forty (40) hours each weok, (The remaining three shifts of
the Fuirlwing Computer has been used by various Lincoln projects.)

On November 1, 1954, a rate structure for tHe Vhiriwind Computer

was , established, ‘Certain DSR projects were charged $350 per hour for the

£5 of this facility. Tho cost of operating and maintaining the DCL staff
was largely defraysd by this $250 usage charge (except by occasional

~ contributions by ONR). Teble VI contains e& summary of tho operating balance
- existing in the DCL Project 6345 at the end of cach figcel period, It is

apparent from this table. that there is a balance of $88,887.80 available
to be uged for completing the studies requested by ONE and to terminate the
project on June 30, 1958,

Operatiag Funds Available From the IBY Corporatica

In addition to the large IBM contribution to the building fund,
the IBY Corporation is making a number of contributions to defray the
cost of operating the Computation Center. Table VII summarizes the
operating fund contributions made by the IBM Corporation, It is apparent
that eside from the bullding maintensnce and management contribution,
the IBM Corporatica is directly contributing epproximately $55,000 per.
year to the cost of operating the Computation Center. The appendix to

t his report summarizes the total contribution made by the IBM Corporation,

Propoged Research Projects

In addition to the computations which will be performed as part of
the normal MIT family computing load, there are several special contracts
which have been set up for the forthecming period, Table VI describes the
particular projects imvolved, projected annual expenditures, and duration of
contract, respectively. The National Science Foundation and the Rockefeller
Foundation grants will help to defray some of the operating costs of the Center,

National Science Foundation Gramt

The National Science Foundation granted MIT $30,000 to "establish
the nucleus of a computing center, to extend existing centers, and to pay
rental for computing time. In some instances part of the fund may be used
for salaries ct research assistants’.

The foundation's program is designed to stremghten basic research
in a number of fields by providing a research investigator's access to computing
facilities, Since many general-purpose university computing centers do not
have sufficient support for basic research, the National Science Foundation
appropriation is intended to stremgthen such activities. It is intended that
advances in scientific research will be accelerated by the formulation of am
adequate conceptual model for natural processes, and checking the accuracy of
the model by calculating anticipated behavior under particular circumstances
within the process.

Rockefeller Foundation Grant

The Rockefeller Foundation has made a grant of $36,000 per year for
a three-year period to help support the research staff at the MIT Computation
Center, It is intended that the research group will explore new ways for using
high-speed computing equipment in the social sciences, These investigations
will include the following studies: :

1. A study of machine logic and an attempt to use it to simulate
some of the human "thinking" processes. Por example, programs
will be written which will cause the machine to play tic tac toe,
checkers, chess, etc.,, which require varying degrees of logic
and complicated thought patterns,

2, Studies will be made in the areas of language tramslation and
historical research -- developing methods for coding information
in compact form with specific emohasis on rapid access,

3. A number of social science experiments will be programmed
on the 704 Calculator simulating "gaming techniques’ which
arise in complex economic systems, This will be similar to
some of the military "games" which were played during the
war using less-powerful machinery.

Rate Structure for the Computation Center
®

It is gpparent from the proceeding sections of this report
that thore ars a number of expenses -- particularly associated with
tho operations staff existing im the Computation Center which are not
gubpidized By eny of the above-mentioned benefactors. The cost of part
of the operations staff of the Computation Center must be financed by
levying a Charge on the services rendered by the Center.

It has been suggested that two types of charges be made for
the use of the gagilities:

1. A 704 machine usage charge et a fixed rate of $180/hour,

2. A programmer assistance charge at 2 fixed rate -- the

exact rate for the programmer assistance charge has to

by epproved by the comptroller. However, iv Bay range
between $5 and $15 per hour,

it is enphazi zed that these changes are designed to defray
the cost of operating the Center and under no condition should there be
y "pro2it" encountered, This means that the actual machine rate structure
will have to be formulated and re-examined on a year-to-year-basis in an
identical manner to that which has been used in the Office of Statistical
Services during the past ssven years,

Every effort will be made to reduce the cost of operating the
Center, Specifically, it is recommended that the method of billing for the
704 computer be similar to that currently employed for the Whirlwind machine,
Actual 704 machine usage is to be maintained by the computer to the nearest 201 of an

- hour and billing reports will be prepared on & sémi-qutomatic basis every

two weeks, Agein, it is important to emphasize that this matter has been
discussed with Mr, Cusick end at this moment complete epproval has not beel
obtained, It is necessary that a decigion of the billing procedure be reached
immediately if we are to bs up to date with our invoices.

Conclugion

Preceding sections of this report provide quantitative information
regarding the cost of operating each of the individual sections of the
MIT Compuietion Center. 4n indication of the available sources of inCone
hog been tabulated -- however, the exact income will, of course, depend
on the actual amount of computer time sold.

A set of operating accounts has been established for the various
groups within the Cznter. It has been domonstrated that these accounts
are adequate for our needs. Now that the Center is actually in physical
being, we are sable to maintein a very tight control on the approval of
expendi tures under the existing IBM contract. ESpecifieally, Dr. Blackburn


-ld-

is located in the Center and is available to continually approve
expendi tures @s soon as they arise, thus maintaining a tight accounting
control.

It should be mentioned that the 704 Calculator hag been used
cn 2 two-ghift basis since June 10, 1957, It is expected that early in
September it will be used oh a three-shift bagisg for the MIT family,

- the No E, Universities, and the IE! Corporation, respectively. The

present allocation of actusl operating machine time is MIT and the

N.E., Universities - 12 hours, and the IBM Corporation - 9 hours. The
rezsgining 3 hours in the day are being used for preventative maintenance

on the computer. It is impor tant to emphasize that the third shift which

is used by the IBM Corporation is not to be used gs a Service Bureau

facility for handling surrounding industries, In particular, all work

which is to be performed by the Center must be non-classified and publishable,
A detailed description of the qualifications of work are described in the
Computation Center Memoram dum CCF-1,
