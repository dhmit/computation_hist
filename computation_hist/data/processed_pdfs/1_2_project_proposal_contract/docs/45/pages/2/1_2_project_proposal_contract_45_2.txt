Dear Hat:

The enclosed raquest for a prOPOSal from ARDC for
research in the use of computing machines has receivad very
considerabls attention from several members of the Physics
Department. It is a problem which is of considerable inier-
est to several of us, in fact it is a problem very similar
in its scope to part of the task-order in the-OER-Whirlwind
contract. It is this similarity, as a matter of fact, which
has led to our hesitation.

we are already doing part of the work outlined in
this request; Harare anxious to do the rest. But we feel
it might be better to do this work under one combined con—
tract instead of trying to serve two masters, so to speak.
Since we have no need of additional funds this year to carry
on, we can afford to wait until some one from ARDC comes up
here to talk over the best may to do what they want to get
done. I would like to have a chance to talk to Dr. Skinner
who, I believe, is the senior civilian in ARDC, about our
plans for the use of the big machines at Tech, for research
and for training. If this can be arranged, please let me
know . '

Yours,.
