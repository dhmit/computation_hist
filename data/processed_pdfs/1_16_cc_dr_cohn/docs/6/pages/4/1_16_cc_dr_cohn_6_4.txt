RIEMANN FUNCTION 299

We observe that (5) is an ordinary differential equation of second order with
only one initial condition. This, however, is natural since (5a) has only one
solution regular al; U = 0. For if we were to expand both U and U .’Lv", y')
into powers of (z — 2’) and (y — y’), we should find that they each begin with
the term (z — %) (y — ¥")H(2' + '), whence f(U; 2/, y') = U + a(2’, y')U* +

Thus at U = 0, equation (5a) has both characteristic exponents zero,
which implies that (5a) has a solution R, regular and equal to unity at U = 0
and a solution R, with a logarithmic singularity at U = 0. Thus (5) uniquely
determines a Riemann function R = R,(U; 2/, ). .

Unfortunately only very few cases are covered by this artifice. The condition
that the Jacobian of (U/dx) (dU/dy)H™" and U with respect to x and y vanish
can be regarded as an identity in 2" and y’ for any given x and y. This identity
in turn leads to an ordinary differential equation if we develop H into power
series about the point » = & + y. Then the identity implies the vanishing of
an infinite series in the variables 2/, ¥ with coefficients expressible in terms of
H(r) and its derivatives. Since the coefficients of such a series must v Anish.
we obtain an ordinary differential equation for H(r), namely

d/dr[H 'd°H /dr* — 3/2(dH/Hdr)’] = 0,
which has as its general solution
(6) H(r) = —A(\ + Dpu /sinh® u(r 4+ »)
where A\, u, v are constants. This is the value of H(r) for which we shall derive
a Riemann function via (5).

In obtaining the Riemann function corresponding to the value of H(7) given
in (6), we find that

U= = XA+ 1)log(1+ V),
where

sinh u(x — 2’) sinh u(y — %)
sinh u(x + v + v) sinh u(2” 4 l’/_, + v)

In terms of V equation (5) becomes

( V(1 = V)d®R/AV* + (1 — 2V)dR/dAV + ANA + DR = 0

R =1 at V =0,
and its solution, a hypergeometric function, is the Riemann function corre-
sponding to H(r) in (6), namely,
(7) R(z,y;2’',y) = F(1 + A, —X; 1; V).

The form of H(r) in (6) is seen to have a few simpler limiting cases. First
of all, we can change A to A exp » and let » — «, obtaining in the limit H(r) =
