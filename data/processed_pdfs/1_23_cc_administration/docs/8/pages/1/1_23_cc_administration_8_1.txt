SUBJSECT: SHARE ASSEMBLER OPERATOR'S NOTES FOR INITIAL USE AT THE MIT
COMPUTATION CENTER

To: Philip M, Morse
Prom: Sheldon F, Best
Date: February 27, 1057

The SHARE ASSEMBLER has been modified so that:
1) many symbolic prograus may be loaded om the zcme imput tape,
2) many sssembly-listings may be obtained or the same output tape,
3) the a2ssembly program itself may be stored on tape.
These operating notes should be used at MIT im place of those issued by the
United Aircraft Corporation on March 7, 1956.

Note ©o any Programmer reading this:

This is really a memo to the machine operator and prograzmers will
ot normally need to kanow many of the details givem below., All the prograz=er
norraally will need to do to get his deck assembled is to give it to am opera-

tor along with a filled out request for assembly form. Blank forms will be

available at the Computation Center. On this form he will indicate what kind
cf binary cards he wants (absclute in the normal case, but possibly relocatable,
or ravely 24 words/card) and whether he wants a2 symbol table or mot., He may
aiso indicate whether he wvants library subroutines printed om his assembly
listing, In due course, he will receive an assembly listimg back which ke
should proofread for erroxrs before submittiag a request to have his program
