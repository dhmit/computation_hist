Mr, Eenneth R. Dunipace
Executive Officer
Aerophysics Research Group
Room 41-203

Dear Hr. Dunipace:

In accordance with your request of January 6, I have discussed
your problem request for "ARG 704" with the Review Board on Wednesday,
January 8. After considerable discussion, I regret to inform you that the
board again refused to approve your application for the following reasons:

 

1. Your request does not reveal the significance of the results
of these computations to the field of aerodynamics -- what
is the significance of this work?

2, Your application indicates that you do not intend to publish
results of your work -- except to your employer, WADC.

3. Your application does not substantiate the purpose of the
work concerning the calculus of variations approach, Do you
intend to use cÂ¢alculus variations? If so, how will this be
done?

4. Your request for machine time =~ G5 hours -~ is excessive in
view of the fact that we schedule only 30 hours per week for
the entire university usage.

The above specific comments are presented since you asked for a statement
concerning the Review Board objections.

As we discussed in our two meetings, we have a definite set of rules
concerning application and use of the 704 ~~ occasioned by our operating
agreement with the IBM Corporation and other financing groups. I discussed
these with you in detail, and they are deseribed in our progress reports and
