Dear 8ir:

In accerdance with reeent discussions between WADC and MIT
technical personmél, there le forvarded herewith a revieed proposal
for & 12 months'! extensien of The reference conitrast starting
January 1, 1958, witheut additional fupds. Thie progoul supersedes
sur proposal forwarded by 1etter dated March 10, 1954,

It is recomménded that the proposed research progras seR-
glet of the feollewing studies and investigations:

1. A study of bouadary-value end eigeavalue problems whish
are frequently enscuntered in the solution of ordimary
differential equations. The proposed study will eem-
gider msthods of solutlon amenable for sclutiomr by
aeens of the differential analyzer, the REAJ, and ether
digital machines.

9. Am imvestigation of the reasibility of solving integral
squations efficisntly by means of eomputing equipment.

9. An javestigation of The solution of certain types ef
glgesrale equations (e.g., the solutior of simaliansous
eguations wilh 41i-conditioned matrices, evaluation of
sheracteristiac roets of matriess, ¢%6...) by means of
available somputing squipment.

. A study of the varisiion determination of simply and-
1ytie weve funstiome; for usse {a the ocalsulation eof
jonization potentials, mltiplet separations, radiation
intenaities, and other properties of atoms eontaliming
is, 28 &nd 2p élegLrons.

Phe Contraster shall contimue %o submit guarterly progrese
reports and WADD ®ashni cal Reports on the above work.
