Computer Science is a new scientific field and Coiputing
Centers are recent additions to institutes of higher learn ng,
This was the first conference to discuss in detail curriculs
related to computer science, as well as the administrative ind
financial problems of computing centers in universities.
Undourbtedly the greatest value of the meeting was in the inier-

others had solved their problems, Of cdurse there were many

Some of these points of view are reported in Appendices D to H,

On a number of basic plicy questions, however, there
wags virtual unaninity. Â©Since these agreed=on conclusions rep=
resent the combined experience of the majority of the Directors
of University Computing Centers in this country, they are set
dovm here, in the hope that they will be useful to other
