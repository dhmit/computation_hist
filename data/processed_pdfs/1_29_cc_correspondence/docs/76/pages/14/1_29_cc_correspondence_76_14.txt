recommended. The library function
XLOCF(N) simply returns the location
of N to the accumulator as a fixed

point constant.

¢. CALL CHAIN (R,T). This statement can be used only
as the last executable statement of a chain link.
It calls the next chain link into core storage to
be executed. Thus, each link or JOb runs to its
conclusion without stopping and progresses to the

next link or job without operator intervention.

d. READ INPUT TAPE. This statement terminates exe-
cution if all data on the input tape has been pre-
viously read. Thus, a programmer may utilize the
technique of continuously reiterating reading and

processing data until all the data is exhausted.
3. Use of END Statement.

The END statement may be used without any of the indicated
sense switch settings following it. Thus, END, which must
be the physically last statement of every FORTRAN source

program, may appear in either of the two following forms:

END
B. END (X I =L .1 »I_), where I may have the value,
(123’45’ e
0, 1,7 or 127

If END statement (a) is used, indicators for the
actual sense switch options will be inserted by
the Monitor. There are two possibilities with

respect to each option indicator.

(1) No Monitor control card is present. The
