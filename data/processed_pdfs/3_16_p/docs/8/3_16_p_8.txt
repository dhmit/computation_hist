Dear Carl:

Now that Winter is almost upon us, I am again writing to
you concerning the various items of unfinished construction in the
Computation Center. Specifically, there has been no action on the
following letters: 1) dated July 11, 1957, 2) dated August 27, 1957,
3) dated September 30, 1957. In addition to the above items, I would
like to add the following:

1. Doors

All of the doors on the fist floor of the Computation
Center have a 1" or 1/2" gap which allows dirt and
cold to enter. For example, we must weather strip the
door of the Receiving Room (26-140). The programming
staff in rooms 139 and 143 are freezing because the
cold air enters this room through the open shipping
room .

2, 4 awakef of the metal doors on the first floor can no
nger be opened (only with difficulty) because of
sagging of the building, e.g., rooms 169, 161, and 157,
respectively.

3. Various windows on the first floor have "warped to such
an extent that it is impossible to close them (even if
you stand on an 8' iadder).

4. We are still mbsing locks in rooms 054, 142A, 144.

5. 704 Room Flgor

i discussed with you and Mr, Collins the need Ior
covering the large holes in the 704 room using either
nasonite ov steel plates, This must be done beiore
someone gets hurt.

6, EAM Room Air Conditioning

According to the air conditioning maintenance staff,
ig is impossible to reduce the large amcunt of cold
air entering the EAM room, I would like to discuss
this matter with Dick Collins so that corrective
action may be taken since the temperature in the high
50's is too cold for working in the room.

7, 704 Air Conditiohing

You are widoubtedly aware that the humidity control
portion of our air cojgditioning is not functioning
properly. Do hou have any information regarding
possible improvements?

I realize you are busy on other matters, but Winter is upon us

and we would appreciate seeing someone to take corrective action on the
above items.

Sincerely yours,

¥. M. Verzuh
Assistant Director
