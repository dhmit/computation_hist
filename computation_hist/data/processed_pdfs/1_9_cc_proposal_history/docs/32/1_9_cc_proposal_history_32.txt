Subject: Research Projects in Computing Techniques for the
Computation Center

Need for Research in Machine Techniques - A year from |
now, with the installation of the IBM 70%, M.I.T. will have an |
operating facility which will become an important tool to aid re-
search in many fields of science and engineering. With the gener-
ous support from IBM, this equipwent will be available, free of
operating and maintenance charges, to those who are able to pro-
gram, test and run off their own computing problems. Many students
and some faculty members can (and should) spend the time needed to
learn about machine operation, to do their own coding and to super-
vise the running off of their own problems. |

Bul® If we are to keep up with the times in the computing
field, or if we wish to go beyond this and take the lead in some
aspects of the use of digital computers in research, we must have,
in addition to the operating and maintenance staff provided by IBM,
a research group capable of investigating the mathematics and pro-
cedures of machine logic, capable of teaching courses in numerical
analysis and machine coding and capable of advising persons using
the. equipment as to best procedures in the analysis and coding of
thelr problems. A small group of this sort has been connected with
Whirlwind since its beginning. It has been to a large extent re-
sponsible for the great utility of Whirlwind in research at M.I.T.
and for the rapld advances in wachine logic which have made Whirl-
wind so versatile. To utilize the 704 effectively, we will need a
similar, but somewhat larger, research group, which can be formed
by taking over the Whirlwind group. and augmenting it.

 

Tasks for Research Group - To make the Computation Center
a true center for research and instruction, it should have, in
addition to the operating and maintenance staff, a research group
having the following duties:

1. To carry on research in numerical analysis, in the
logic of coding and in the development of programming techniques.

2. To lnvestigate procedures for recording and processing
of large-quantity experimental data or operational records or other
information, and to develop programs for the statistical analysis
of such data and its display or presentation in quickly understandable
form.

3. To aid in instructing students and others in these
subjects, and to help supervise student research in these fields.

4, To build up a library of useful sub-routines for the
solution of often-encountered problems, to prepare instruction
manuals, lists of routines, tables of functions, etc., which will
improve and extend the utilization of computing equipment at M.I.T.
and elsewhere.

5. To participate in conferences and other Joint activi- N
ties with staffs of other computation centers, so that knowledge
of this rapidly changing field can be exchanged with other workers.

Organization and Budget - Part of the staff of this re-
Search group shou e members of various departments at the In-
stitute paid in part. from Computation Center funds, for helping
supervise its work, and in part by the departments for their
regular teaching assignments. In this way we can have available
guidance, initiative and knowledge from a variety of points of
view, and can also maintain close liaison between the Center and
the students and faculty of those departments which can most
effectively utilize digital computers. We will also require a
few senior, full-time staff members, to maintain continuity of
effort, to help supervise research, to prepare the wanuals and
sub-routines mentioned in task 4, and to be on hand to advise users
of the Center as to best procedures. The Junior staff will be, in :
part, the research assistants and assoclates supported by IBM funds.

The yearly budget for such a research group would be
roughly $100,000, broken down as follows:
5 Faculty members (1/2 salary, average of g4t,000 each) §& 20,000
4 Full-time staff members (average salary £7,000) £38,000

4 Full-time secretaries, editorial and administrative :
assistants (average salary g4,000) 16,000

g 64,000
approximate 40 per cent overhead ._26,000

$ 90,000
Travel 4,000
Publication costs, expendable material, ete. 6,000

£100,000

| Possible Financial Support - Since thalCenter wlll provide
an important educational facility, which will be used by wany In-
stitute students, a part of this budget should be provided out of
the Institute educational budget. In addition, a number of the re-
search laboratories and projects at the Institute, which will use

the computing equipment to an appreciable extent, and which will
depend on our research group to help them in their use of the a
Center, should provide a yearly subsidy for this work. These con-
tributions might add up to as much as $30,000 a year; the rest of
the funds must come from special grants for this work.

Both the ONR and the NSF are interested in supporting
research in the use of computing machines and I propose that we
ask for $35,000 a year from each, to support our program. The
ONR has been supporting Whirlwind and its use in scientific re-
search, to an amount of $200,000 a year for several years; this
request will represent a substantial reduction in cost to them,
with no reduction in the amount of research which we will be turn-
ing out. The NSF is particularly interested in the field of com-
puters and their scientific application; their special advisory
committee, headed by Dr. von Neumann, has recommended support of
research in this field. If their budget 1s increased for next
year, they should be able to contribute.

I would hope that this support could be continued for
three to five years. A research group will need to be continued,
at the Computation Center, for as long as the Center exists, of
course. But as time goes on, the research it does may well be-
come more speclalized, so that support can be obtained from other
sources. Certainly at the end of three years the work should be
reviewed, to re-determine its direction and scope.

Recommendations - I recommend that one or more DIC
projects be set up ror this research group, starting July 1, 1956;
starting at a low rate of expenditure (perhaps 1/2 the full rate)
to prepare for the TOY operation, to have ready program techniques
and research plans and to supervise the first group of IBM research
assistants. By January 1, 1957, when the 704 is to be installed,
we can take over the Whirlwind research staff and go ahead at full
strength. I recommend that we request $25,000 apiece from ONR and
NSF for the first year's operation and indicate to both that we
will need a total of about £100,000 apiece from them for three
years of operation. I also recommend that procedures be worked
out so that other DIC research projects, which are going To use
the facilities of the Center for research or educational work in
conforming with the requirements of publishability and quality
specified in our agreement with IBM, can contribute to the support
of the research group. It is possible, as the use of the Center
by other universities increases, that some of this support will
come from projects in these other institutions.
