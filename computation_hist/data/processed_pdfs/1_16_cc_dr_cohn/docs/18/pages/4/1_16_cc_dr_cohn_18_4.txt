result to be false. Then a subsequence of values of P exists which tends to infinity
and which permits equations (2) and (3) to be.z satlsﬁed'by a ¢ and 7 lying ingjde
the open intervals just mentioned. We find it convenient to select a still finey
subsequence for which the values of ¢ fit the descrlpthn of one of the cases listeq
in the adjoining table. By referring each case to equation (2), we find the asymp-
totic relationship thereby implied between ¢ and r. These results are listeq ip
the next column of the table. Now using this information, we can calculate the
asymptotic value of the left hand member of equation (3), (which supposedly
holds). But these values, listed in the last column, are easily seen to be nop.
vanishing, hence the proof by contradiction is complete.
