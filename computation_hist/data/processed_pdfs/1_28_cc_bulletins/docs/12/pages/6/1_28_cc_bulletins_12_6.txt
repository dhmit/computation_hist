The Pseudo-operation IFF P,ASB

This imstruction provides conditional assembly of program segments
within a macro according to the values of the parameters P,A,B, P is a SAP
expression, A and B are BCD symbols, This instruction results in assembly of
the next imstruction in seguence if and only if the truth value of the boolean
expression

P&EQq

is 1, where

P =1 or 0 according as SAP equivalence of P is
greater than or equal to zero,

Q = 1 or 0 according as A and B are identical
or different BCD symbols,

Thus the instruction
IFF 1,A,B

says, "if and only if it is true that A and B are identical symbols, assemble
the next instruction'; while

IFF 0,A,B

says, "If and only if it is false that A and B are identical symbols, assemble
the next instruction,” Amn example of the use of this instruction is

MOP ADD A,B,C
CLA A

ADD B

IFF 0,C,AC
STO C

END ADD

The macro ADD does the same job a8 the macro ADD3 defined earlier, but with

extra sophnistication, By using the special symbol AC for the third argument,
the programmer can call for the result of the addition A+B to be left in the
accumulator and not stored, Examples:

MAC ADD, X,Y¥, 2 MAC ADD,X,Y,AC
CLA X CLA X

ADD Y ADD ¥

STO Z

The IFF instruction can be put to other uses:
The reader may verify that

IFF Q

means, assemble if and omnly if the eguivalence of Q is mot zero"; that
IFF Q/11

means, "sssemble if and only if the equivalence of Q exceeds 10", and that
IFF Q-Q/2%2 |

means, "assemble if ahd only if Q = 1 (mod 2)." Also, simce the equivalence
of an uncaefimed expression is taken to be zero, omne can interpret

IFF Q

to mean "assemble if and only if Q is defimed”, provided thaut the equivalence
of @ is expected not to be =zero,
