(1) Requirements fop classroom use, Including display
€quipment, €ither direct handwritten Of Cypewritten input, am
Programming Systems for both handwriting analysis and Simpler
Problem statement (such as the normal formulae and conven-
tions of 2 particular field).  The work on direct input is
centering about devices that Will have the appearance of g
normal blackboard or drafting table. The handwriting analy-
Sis Programming is being carried On as part of thesis work,
Chat problen bresentation from formulae input will develop
from the present "macrodirectiyve"” work of the MIT Solig
State Physics group. As has been indicated, the remote dis-
Play problem is in a much less Satisfactory state, as work
is at present centering around devices sueh as the tele-
type equipment used to project ticker tape quotations in
brokerage houses. Other possibilities include the develop-
ment of g self-terminating Scope display that could use
Projection Television Cype of equipment,

(2) Requirements fop formal remote console use: 7Ip this

pPut-output data rates and the Cype of €quipment that can meet
these objectives. For the pPresent, 1t appears that any one
of a number of Cypewriter Cypes with additional pushbuttons
for special purposes will suffice, These are for the most
part presently avallable.

(3) Definitjon of the overall system: Analysis is being
carried out to determine Che Necessary configuration of the
overall system.. This work is still largely only in qualitg-
tive terms.,

(4) Formulation of the overall Programming system: In
this area, with the exception of small bieces of the problem,
sSuch as the Linking Loader and Che FMIS System, very little
has been done. It is €xpected that a mueh greater rate of
progress will become available as the system configuration,
manpower, and funding are more firmly established.
