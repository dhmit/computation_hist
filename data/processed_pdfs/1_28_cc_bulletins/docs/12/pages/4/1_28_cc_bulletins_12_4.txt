In the above example, dummy arguments appear only as symbols in
the address part of the instruction, but = dummy argument Hay appear anywhere
in the variable field (card columns 12-72) of any card within a macro defini-
tion, and may also appear in the location field (columns 1-6) and operation
field (columns 8-10). iIf a symbol is defined by appearing in the location
field of an instruction within a macro, then that symbol would usually be made
a dummy to avoid multiple definition from repeated use of the macro,

The rangeof a macro definition ig from the MOP card bearing a given
name to a following END card bearing the same macro name, Thus macro defini-
tions may be nested one within another, When this is done, however, an imner

macro will not be defimed until all macros within which it is rested have been
expanded

The definition of macro X may include calls for other macro instruc-
tions whether or not the other macros have been defined, as long as all such
macros are defined before a MAC call for macro X oceurs, Circular definitions,
which would result in o loop in the assembler, must be avoided by the programmer,

To give greater flexibility to macro ocperations, parentheses have been
set aside for special use within the variable field of MOP and MAC instructions,
Thus parentheses may not be used as part of a2 macro name or of a symbol which
appears within a macro operation, The same restriction applies to the use of
equal signs within the range of a MOP, There are no restrictions on the use
of parentheses or equal signs as part of normal SAP symbols outside of macros.

Programmers not using maeros will find no visible changes in the way
SAP works .

al Macro Names and nts

The sequence of characters following the macro name on a MOP or MAC
card will be referred to as the macro argument string, The name of a macro-
operation and the dummy arguments in the argument string of a MOP ecard may be
any legal SAP symbols not containing parentheses or equal signs, or may be
numeric quantities, (The number zero rust not be used as a dummy argument.)

As usual in SAP leading zeros are ignored, A legal SAP symbol occur-
ring in a macro definition as name or dummy argument need mnot be distinect from
ordinary symbols defined elsewhears in the program, The name of = macro defini-
tion may not be blank or empty, If the name of a macro defined earlier is used
for another macro definition, the earlier definitiom is effectively wiped out,

The arguments supplied in the MAC eall may be any SAP expressions mede
up of symbols satisfying the above requirements, separated by commas or by
parentheses as described below, Their correspondence with the dummy arguments
of the macro definition is determined by their pesition im the sequence follow-
ing the macro name, A pair of parentheses surrounding an exprossion in a MAC
argument string signifies that everything between the parentheses is to be
substituted for the corresponding argument in the macro definition, Thus,
using the three-address additiomn macro given earlier, the call

MAC ADD3,As1,%% (B,1)

would expand into

CLA AÂ¢l
ADD s@
8TO B,1

A further example, illustrating the fact that MACro names themselves may be
substituted, is
