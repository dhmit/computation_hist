Dear Mr, Nordbottent

I's soFEy about the. dotdy in sasvering your letter of apiti 2, but donichow
communication between Professor Morse and me broke down. Of course we would be
delighted to have you visit the Institute to carry nut research on the applica-
tion of electronic computers in econometrics. It would seem most natural for
you to be associated with the Department of Ecoromics, We would be happy to"
sponsor you as a Guest of the Institute. With this status you will be free to

attend all legtures and seminars and make use of all facilities. The Department

has an IBM 1620 computer available for local services, The ‘Computation Genter
you know about. - |

While Iwill bo on leave next vear, my sollsaguen Figher and Kuh will be
here and they are interested in problems similar to yours, Please let us know
when to expect you, ST Nr

Would you send good wishes from me to Odd Ankruet?

Sincerely yours,
