PROPOSAL FOR NSF GRANT FOR SUPPORT OF RESEARCH

BY THE OCCASIONAL USER

Statement of the Problem - Iarge, electronic digital computers
have great pocencialities zor advancing research in the many areas
which require a great deal of drudge calculation, but up to now
their potential capabilities have been hampered by a "mismatch"
between machine and possible user. Specilal input equipment is not
yvet designed to allow masses of experimental data ¢o be fed directly
to the machine; special outpubt equipment is needed in order To display
results in compact and easily understandable formg; and the present
. ¢ode of instructions to the machine the "machine langauge" is not
easy to learn or to use.

The basic difficulty is that electronic computers are extremely
complex pieces of equipment and a great deal of study will be
required before we can undersatand its behavior well enough to be
able to control it effortlessly and flexibly. At present one who
wishes to use a large computer often has to spend three to five months
developing, encoding and testing a program to instruct the machine how
to perform the necessary millions of operations which, at the end, the
computer will carry through in a2 few hours. True, these five months
of preparation plus the few hours of actual computation may be much
shorter than the several years required to obtain the same results by
using a desk computer, nevertheless it 1s obviously desirable to |
devise procedures which will shorten this preparation time, even at
the expense of additional machine time.

Pro for Research on Machine Capabilities - 1In order to
learn how tO make digital computers easier o use one must have a
machine of large capacity, a large supply of possible computations
to be done, drawn from a wide variety of scientific fields, plus a
gtaff which thoroughly understands the machine behavior and is
interested in working with the prospective users in order to simplify
methods of use, With this combination of equipment and staff it
should be possible, in a few years, to work out special operating
programs, additional input and oubtput equipment and other techniques
which will considerably reduce the time and effort required to get
a problem s8olved by the machine,

The M.I.T. Computation Center - The one place in the United
States where this combination of machine, variety of problems and
staff already exists is at M.I.T. This past year IBM has installed
a 704, of the most up-to-date capacity for the use of the college
and universities of New England, M.L.T. has contributed most of the
