machine play chess or checkers in other words to obey the logic

of a game. Different Sciences and branches of learning have their

own kinds of thought processes. For example economics and genetics each
have patterns of thought whieh do net exactly duplicate those of

physics. Fundamental research is needed to work out programs, rules

of thought for the machine, which correspond more closely to these

other patterns. With a machine of the flexibility and storage

capacity of the 704, such research is worth while. It will have to

be tackled, at the beginning}by teams of experts in the fleld of
interest, together with mathematical logicians who know machine
operation.

B, Another general line of attack is in the field of the
Sstorage and rapid access to information, such as is needed in the
problems of language translation and historical research, for example.
Several schemes of coding of information, so that it can be found
quickly and easily, have been devised on paper, but the "bugs" in
such Schemes will only become apparent when masses of information,
of the order of several hundred thousand 1tems, are to be ordered
and sorted out. The new installation at the Computation Center will
have a storage capacity of this size. Some of the proposed Schemes
should be tried out, and others developed, by members of the Center
staff working with persons familiar with the information and its
uses. & For example a project in machine translation has already
been setup, under the direction of Professor Locke of the Language
Department. As 1t develops, it will need the help of machine pro-
gramming specialists and will need the use of a machine to test 1its
ideas. The translation project is already Supported by the
Rockefeller Foundation, but parallel work by the Computation Center
on techniques for rapid access to large-quantity data would help

this work as well as others. Another promising direction of investi-
