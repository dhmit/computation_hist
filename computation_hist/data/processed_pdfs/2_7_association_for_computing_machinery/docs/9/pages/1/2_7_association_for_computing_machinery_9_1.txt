Dear Gordon:

I have already applied for time on the Lynn
machine for the one research contract we have which
authorizes purchase of computer time. This will not
help people without money, which is the case with all
but one of the users in our department.

In your reply you might thank Aucoin and tell
him you'll advise your colleagues in the School of

Engineering.
Sincerely,

,v// 1,, ,
