HISTORICAL BACKGROUND~ THE ROCDFBLLER DU'FBRBlffIAL ANAL1Zlll
The original
deaisn and developaent of the Differential
Analyser
na initiated
earl:, in 1936, and several of the basic features of the
machine wsre deterained
at that tiae.
Specifically,
the design of the
aervcaeclmnim
s,atem which 'ffSWled
to interconnect
the coaponents of
the aacbine waa developed during that period.
Thie is aentioned siapl:,
to inclic3te that during recent years SOile of the aa.tntenance problem•
aaaociatcad with the RDA were occasioned by the particular
serYCJaechani .. s
which were eaplOJ'ed.
These were vintage 1936, and as such, were not
cOlllpetitive with post-World Var :U aervoaechmiiBl!I design.
The origiDal Center of Analysts was foraally
organized by Profeaaor S. H.
Caldwell in July, 1939 with the aici of a grant of $30,000 froa the Carnegie
Foundation.
During its earl:,,
foraative
J'e&rS, the Center existed largely
on grants froa the Rockefeller
Foundation, Blectrica.l
Engineering Departaento
and other sources; and it was not until 1942 that the RDA. was finally
placed
into o~ation.
Begiuing
at thAt tiae,
the RDA provided a source of
financial
revenue which assisted
in the formulation of a self - aupporttn1
regble.
During 1941, the activities
of the Center (under the direction
of
Taylor) were expmded
to include a large battery of desk calculators
and associated
personnel who were well advanced in the use of n•eric .al
analysis
techniquea.
At that tiae, the Center contained 3 principal
types
of faciU ties:
a.
1. The Differential
Analyzer
facility
consisting
of 2 aachinee:
) ~e original
6-Integrator
Differential
Analyser ,
b) The nn Rockefeller

purpoaes).
Du.ring 'tht, war :,as.rs 1942-45, the s.taf.f of

Because of the
cooputational
activity
(3-ehift

type of opere~!ou resulted
in tbs creation
of a.er $40,000.

ths Center was increased
large voltme of var-time
etc.).
this self supporting
of g financial
reaer,,e fund
returnaci from his NDRC assigmaent in 1945
position
as active
Director of the Center.
Tbs post-,ar
:,eera 1946-4? had a devaatatiog
effect on the previously~
sentioned financial
reserve . The volU!!le of ccmputational
work was aharpllf
cvtailed
daring thie period, but tha operating
staff of the Cen,ter ,ma
not nat91"i&lly reduced.
As a consequence,
the two-year period 1948-49
were ver~ trying year& froe the t:1nan.cial standpoint;
and during this
period,
the IBH <i;roup and the Hand COllputing Group w_,re separated

would create a a'9rious open.ting

As a. reeult,
a decieion was med• to discontinue

Dr. St ra tton learned
of the •1tuaticm
in tme to prevent dissolution
of the flll,'Dup, and et his
direction,
the lm.i pU!lChed-card facility
was reactivated
on Joly 1, 1949, and

sponsorship.
FinallyD on Jtuly 1, 1950, the Administration
set up the IBM
group aa an Administrative
Office -- the Office of Statistical
Services.
It also becalle appQ.rsnt that the original
6-Iategrator
Differential
Analyzer ns no longer required
at li.I.'l . , and consequentlJ
it was pre-
sented
to Va::,ne University
in July, 1949 where it ia still
in operation.
Berly in 1941 the Differential
Analyzer Group (the last remain!~
section
of the Ceater of Analysis)
WAS about to be dissolved
because of financial
difficulties.
Fortunately,
in .J1J11e, 1949, a contirac"t was initiated
vith the
U;· S. Air Fo:-ces vhich provided thG necesssry financial
aasistance
needed
to continua its operation.
In JTU~y, 1949, F. !I. Verzuh ,ma aleo placed in
!n charge of the RDA group and van faced vith the · problea of hiring a new
operating
staff.
(The former group of llleaa<ars. J. L. c. I.Sf, B. lloraob.,
G. ltuneteidt, M. Coate, etc. had been released.)
A nn operating
staff consisting
of Measrs. J. M. Bua, and H. ·11.

were laired and trained,
and the n8'1 ~ group consisting
of

The Instrumentation
Laboratory expressed a desire to asaUBe the res -
ponsibility
for RM operation
in order that it aight carry on design and
calibration
studies for nerw CO!llpating sights and aamunition which were under
current investigation
in the Laboratory.
Furthenaore,
certain
lnstr1111entation
Laboratory contractual
comlitaents
were concel!'nfld with the dev e los-ent
of ia -
proved caaputing sights,
and the solution of aesoci~ted kinematic equations
required the use of the ·RDA.
The Laboratory
felt tha t the RDA vaa u..11:!que in it s deaonstrated
capability
for handling problass of that type.
It affi'St be remeabered that at that tiae
(19SO) the status of present-day
large-scale
comput ers was not where it ia at
the present t!ae, and aa a result,
ihesecalibration
· studies could be carried
out aore effectively
on the &nalog aachina.
As it turned out ·, this was a aost fortunate
decision on tbe pert of the
Inatruaentation
L2b<oratory since it resulted
in the design of new lead computing
sights which vsre used most effectivel~
in p~opeller and jet combat over Korea.
In this regard , the DitfGl!'ential
Analyzer again made a IROSt valuable co ntribution
to the ~ar effort.
·· ·"'
In the meantia0, hnever,
there were continuous ruablinga in the backpoad
concerning the reaoval and disposition
of the RDA. It was clearly realized . that
this aa ch!ne was 1nclleGd a very old computing 1!1&.chine by existing
stQnd~rds.
As

As the performance of the Whirl~ind Computer tmprov~ and aore inter-

SURVEY OF THE APPLXCA'l'ION OF Tim DIFFERENTIAL ANAL"!ZM
In retrospect,
it is of interest
to pcint out SO!ll8 of the principal
contrUmticns
l!l&de by the Analyzer dW!'ing its 12-year Ufa at Ii!. I. T. llt.
.ust be remaabered, of course, that its early applications
~ert!/ strongly
in-
fluenced
by World War n.
Specifically.
tbe machine was completed bi 1942, and
since the applications
during the period 1942-1945 were al1110st entirely
of a
ilitary
character,
the foll011Jiimg t11>ea of problems were solved (in s<0ee case
thousands of tia0s):·

As a IIUl.tterof fact. thG contributions
made by the Analyzer wer• conaidered
to be sufficiently
important that the Navy Department issued
Na•al Ordnance
Developaent Award in recognition
of the vork performed by the Differential
Analysers
and associated
ccaputing staZf.
"e
in acldition to such stv.dies. the Analyzer vas used to design nn tn,es of
lead ccaput:lng sights.
tracking systems t aircraft
component design.
etc . This t .n,e
of activitJ
was carried on by the Xnstrumentation
Laboratory during the years
"1950-1954.
It is evident frora the above partial
list of problems that tbe Analyzer n.s
priaarily
used for the solution of military
pro blems. However, there were a
naber ·of industrial
problems ··aolved on this machine.
For exaaple:
l) Study of the performance of a supercharge,
Study of circuit
solution of electrical
networks,
3) Analysis of the d~ic
performance of asrvoaechanias,
4) Studies associated
with heat flow probl13Ss,
. 5f Study ·of . a problem in e-.yae kinetics,
6) Studies of the atmospheric
oscillation
of the upper ataospllere .,
7) Studies of · a boundary value F,Oblem associated -with the design of
an ultra centrifuge,
·
·. ·

In addition to the above industrial
problams, the machine was used to a
Uai ted extent for the solution of academic proble&s aris.ing in H. I. T. thesis
re•earch.

u a Dtter of fact, this was true to such an eztent that the
aachlne did not contribute••
effectively
to the academic reaearch prop--
•• it aipt
hawe done had it not been operated an a self'.!supportnng
basis.
S~ifically,
I bell-..e the operation
of a aachine ccaputing facility
of this
type should be apouored in auch a ll&!Uler that the financial
revenue for its
u~illsation
not be the prillary c.oncern.
The Analyzer was alw a ys operated under
a aelf-1111pporting basis, and this of necessity
liaited
its application
to groups
who bad adequate means to pa y f or ito use.
A better
plan,of @Om'ae, is one in
which the Adainistration
would prov! .de: .adequa te financial
support to perai t . the
operation of these facilities
for educ a tion al training
and r e search.

plans were rapidly fol'lllul ated
for its actual removal . Specifically,
early in Septaber,
Dr . Stratton arrnnged
for an 11.I.T. appropriation
of $5000 (Operating Account 1979. 41) to couer the
cost of reoving
and disaantling
of the RDA. On August 17, 1954, Prof. G. s:.
Brown officially
notified
v&rious aC!lii!bers of the M.I.T. family of the decision
to reacwe the RDA and askad th8'll to express their interest
in poaraible use of

Thsrefore,
in approximstely

It is alao evident froa Table I that a nUlllber of M.I.T. projects have
received coaponents froa the RDA. In certain cases, e.g., D:,naaic Analysis
Control Laboratory (DACL), Flight Control Laboratory (FCL), Servoaech!ffli ...
Labora tor:, (R!:AC) , Acoustics Laboratory,
etc. , the cGDponents will be incor-
porated into other ccaputing aachines . In other cases, the eqjipaent will be
used for graduate thesis research.
This is largely true for all the equipaent
released to various Jael!lbers of the Electrical
and Aeronautic&l Engineering

MACHINE SHOP BQUIPDNT TRANSFimKED TO ELEC'm I CAL ENGINRBRING
At a conference held on &lay 24, 1954. atte l!llli
ed by Profeseor C. Floe,
Dean Harrison and F. Verzuh, the disposition
of the capital
gocda, aachinH ,
etock and materials,
etc. available
in tile RDA eachine ahop wa11 couidered
.
It was decided that the RDA shop equip!Nnt was to be tr&Deferred to aooa 10-481
where it rill
be reactivated
as a sbop to be used in connection with the coa -
putational
activities
which have been recently
transferred
to Building 10 .
. Professor G. S . Brown npects
to use a aacJiiniat
froa the Blectrical
Bngineering
Shop to organise the new shop.
Hot all of the equiP9ent availabiw in the RDA. Shop has been awed to
10-481.
For ezaaple, an Allen Drill Press (Hodel Ho. 2) wa• given to Jlr.
Kallenbach of the Physics Shop (Roca 6 - 014) at the direction
of Dean Barriaon .

to these capital
goods, a conaiderable
am,ount of metal stock and aateriels
($1465) was also
transferr ed at that time . The entire facilities
of a 3-.an shop (working benches,

REALLOCATION
The reaoYal of the RDl will naturally
serve to releaae a nllllber of bay•
of apace in Building 7 . Specifically,
2450 sq . ft . of apace have been releaeed
u a result of the reaoval of the RDl. The following breakdown indicates
the
apace involved:
Bay
Area (sq . ft. )
7-302 (2)
7-303 (4)
3-329
700
HOO
350
(1)
2450
:u · a
aatter of fact, th e aacbine shop which formally occupied the two bays
in 7-302 has already been transferred
to Roam 10-481 and the two bays in
7-30.'2 are currently
occupied by the Bducational council.
The r ... ining 5 bays of space (1750 sq. ft . ) are to be occup ied by the
Architecture
Departaent.
The receipt of th ia 2500 ll!Cl· ft. of apace should
certainly
help to alleviate
their space requirellents.

CONCLUSION
This aeaorandua contains SOile of the tacts associated
with the re11oval of
the RDA. A bri~f description
of the historical
background
of the aachine, a
survey of its applications,
and diaposition
of various ccapon~nts are described
in considerable
detail.
A breakdown of the .apenses
incurred in this operation isgi ven, and it
is of interest
to note that only $2838.59
was required to remove this "200- ton
gill:llt " frOl!I . the M.I.T. preaises.
Perhapis of equal interest
is the fact that it
only required 60-aan dsys (a.er a 2-week period) to accoapliah this removal.
. It is boped that tbi1' report
contains
sufficient
information
acknowledge the financial
11astitance received · :from the Rockfeller
to properly
Research
Foundation.
Furthermore,
it should sarve as a record · of the disposition
of the
equipaent contained on the machine.
Jn this regard, it is perhaps well to men-
tion that an entire power plant facilities,
notably, por,er tre.nsforaers,
a motor
generator set, an air compressor, a precipitron
unit, etc ., have been given to
Buildings
and Po\Yer 'for ot~er: II .• I. T. use.
' ·
·
.··
in cl~ing,
1t is evident that the RDA ~as served a very useful purpoee
in the lnatitute.
Howreviar, Uke all things, it had a liaited
life and certainl:,
had becaae obsolete hy existing
standards of the large-scale
computing equipaent.
It 1• therefore
only proper that it should be removed and that other modern
coaputing equipaent be installed
to serve in its place.
