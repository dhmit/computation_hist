INTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM

TOs Dr. F. M, Verzuh
FROMg Dr. Arthur L. Losb
DATE: November 1, 1958

SUBJFCT: Allocation of Machine Time.

Problem number M2L1 has used ils allotted time for the fourth
quarter of 1958 in testing and debugging the basic program. This is just
about completed.

As the program is designed for general use as a service program
for our laboratory, the specific solutions vsed have yet to be tested.
Furthermore, the final form of the program has not been assembled, nor
have any production runs been attempted,

In view of these continued demands on the computer, I will need
an additional 100 minutes (1.5 hours) to complete the work outlined. 2241,
according to the scheduler's records, has overrun its time by 1.47 hours;
according to the Auto Oper. Records, it has overrun by 0.25 hours. The
discrerancy is demonstrated in the enclosed chart by Philip Friend. 1
will request 180 minutes (3.0 hours) additional time to insure sufficient
time to complete this work.

T also request that programmer number 165 be transferred from

Lehel Nagy-Kovendy to Philip Friend.
