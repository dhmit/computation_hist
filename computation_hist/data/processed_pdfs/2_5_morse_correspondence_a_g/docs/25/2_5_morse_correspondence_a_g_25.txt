Computation Center
Room 200-206

Dear Frank:

Encloaeci is a schedule for the entertainment of approximately
thirty economists of the E‘edorol Reeerve Benita of the United
States who in some sort of a convention in Boston are coming
to M. I. T. on the naming of Monday. May 13, under the epon-
eorehip of Mr. ﬁellece Dickson whom I understand to be the
Director of Public Information of the F'ederal Reserve Bank

of Boston. The echedule up through 10:30 is firm, also from
12:00 no. to 1:30. There remains the period in between which
I have listed on the enclosed schedule as for the S-ohell Econ:
in Building 52 from 10:24.0 to 11:50 in your charge.

Should the computer ”7014“ which was our original objective be
in any condition to shoe them, this schedule can have their
10:1;0 destination obanged accordingly, and it would then be
eesential only to get them to the Faculty Club in time to
start lunch at 12:00.

It is my understanding that if “70A“ is not in shape at that
time, you or someone provided by you will endeavor to engage
this group in informative conversation of some sort in the
Schell Room for the period indicated.

The telephone connection by which I contact Dickson is 311116ch
6-7100, and I think it would be first rate if you can find

out from him more about the capacities of these people and
what can be best done for them. Your assumption of this nebu-
lous assignment is much appreciated.

Sincerely yours,

John 'i’i. h. Bunker
