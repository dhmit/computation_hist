Dear Dr. Nor-53 :

For some tins this Center has been interested in the
acolicatian of certain mthcmtical and statistical models,
such :25 gama theory, to the oroblems of personnel utilise-
tion in the military service. We are concerned with n
variety of arablems which my be attacked with the use at
certain of these models.

An exam-ale of the sort of problem which we have in
mind is one of minimizing the cost of training Air Force
technicians. There are available psychological tests
which give a good indication of a men‘s probable success in
technical school training. These tests give differential
predictions for different kinds of training with concomitant
different probabilities of success. With these probabilities
and with good estimates of the cost to train men in each of
the several specialties, it is hoped that a minimising cro-
cedurs might be used to indicate the most economical way of
assigning individuals to technical training, while at the
same time taking a minimum risk of not meeting the Air Force
requirements.

 

 
 

We are also interested in the application of general
ournose cannuters to the woblems of personnel utilization,

particularly the solutions of mathematical models which might
be appropriate for personnel classification and training, es.
pecially methods of managing very large masses of data, which
considered separately have little predictive value, but which
considered as a whole, permit good estimates of future ner-

fornsnce .
