Machine Ccomplement of the M.Ji.T. Computation

The M.I.T. Computation Center will have a Type 704 Electroni
Data Processing Machine with the following machine Cump*cmvnt
12 megnetic tape units, 2 magnetic CORE storage units containing
total of 8,000 woxrds, 1 magnetic drum unit containing ;,OQO words
of atovagv. the usual on~line punched card reader, alphabetic pr
and punched card recorder .as as well as
controlled printer, magncc*c tape controlled card punch, and pun
card-~-to-magnetic tape converter, respectively. Total machine
‘complement net monthly- vental is slightly over $45,000. In addi
to the 704, there will be 10 zuxiliary punched card machines inc
card punches, collators, sorters, reproducers, interpreters, and
Type 407 Accouniing Machine. The aggregate machine rental is in
excess of § 50,000 per month,

The Type 704 EDPM unit is the faste

 

 

comeercial computers available today. Since the H.I.z. instaliz*ien
will be but one of many in the field, technigues, programs, and
numerical procedures developed for this machine will b2 of universal use.
