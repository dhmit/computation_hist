6. Order of magnitude. From the value of 71 in equation (15)
it follows that for z in 5,
(17) 1P = 2 + 007).

Using the power-series expansion of the logarithm, we ﬁnd that it is
approximated by f + 0(n§°). Thus equation (17) leads to

(18) §+ 007?“) = z + 0(71),
and from this,
(19) (r — 2W = 0(6),

which is ac“) as e —+ 0.

Now from (19) the limit (6), deﬁning P(z), must exist at least
for a subsequence of e. The uniqueness of the limit will follow,
later, from the fact that we are dealing with a regular function, P(z),
completely characterized by certain transformation equations (21*)
and (22*) (below), together with the estimate (from (19)),

§ 2, it follows immediately that

(21) (J—l/z) = #l/K'JZl
To obtain the linear transformation representing {(2 + 1), we note

that, in Figure 2, 2T = z + 1 must map the arc w’ﬁ’ onto «43. Thus
we ﬁnd

Next, using the values given in §5 together with equations (6) and

(16), we obtain in a straightforward manner f

More generally, by this technique we see that

8. Final identiﬁcation of the perturbation function. Here armed
with equations (20), (21 *), and (22*), we can establish the exhansion
(10). Let the right-hand side of (10) be denoted by 3(2). It can be
formally veriﬁed that 3(2) satisﬁes properties (20), (21*), and (22*).
Thus, letting U(z) = P(z) — S(z), we ﬁnd

(24) U(—l/Z) = U(z)/z2
(25) U(z + l) = U(z)
(26) [1(2) = 0(23) as z—vioo,

and, in addition, U(z) is regular when Im z > 0.

Now we assert that such a U(z) is identically zero. For since
the function 42(2) = U(2)J’(z) is invariant under the modular group,
by conditions (24) and (25), it is a single~valued function of J (2).
Furthermore, by condition (26), 4>(z) is not ‘large enough" to be
anything but linear, i.e., ¢(z) = pJ(z) + a, for constants p and 17.
Finally, the constants p, a both vanish since ¢(z) = 0 at z : i and
z = % + ix/§/2, This establishes the expansion (10) (which is,
however, most naturally derived by the heuristic method of §3).
