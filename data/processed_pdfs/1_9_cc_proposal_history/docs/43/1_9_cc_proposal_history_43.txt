OPERATIONAL ASPECTS OF PRESENT M.I.T. COMPUTING FACILITIES

Introduction

This memorandum is intended as an Appendix to the report entitled

Requirements for for Electronic Computing Equipment for
Training and and for r Educational Research at the Institute

which was submitted to the Administration by the Institute Committee on
Numerical Analysis and Machine Computation on May 1, 1854

The purpose of this memorandum is to describe some of the aspects
associated with the operation of various M.I.T. computing faciliies. Princi-
computing facilities are listed, approximate operating costs are given, and
machine utilization is classified into the following categories:

1. Academic: Classroom Lectures and Thesis Research
2. Administrative Office Procedures

3. D.I.C. Sponsored Research

4. Military Applications

Although there are many computers of various sizes available at M.I.T., this
report is confined to a discussion of the larger facilities:

1. Aeronautics Dept.-- Philbrick & Simulation Equip.--Prof. W. McEay
2. Dynamic Analysis Control Lab.--DACL--Dr. W. Seifert
3. Elec. Engineering Dept.-~-REAC--Prof. G. Newton
4. Instrumentation Lab.--REAC & Simulator -- Dr. H. Laning
5. Rockefeller Diff. Analyzer--RDA--Dr. F. M. Verzuh
8. Statistical Services-~IBM~-Dr. F. M. Verzuh

7. Whirlwind--WWl--Prof. C. W. Adams

8. Desk Calculator Groups--RLE~-Prof. H. Feshbhach
9. Desk Calculator CGroups--Aero-clastic--Prof. R. Bisplinghof

Operation and Maintenance K Costs

Table I contains information regarding the number of individuals
and their associated annual cost for each of the principal M.I.T. computing
facilities. The following personnel breakdown is utilized:

1. Analyst: Numerical analysts, CPC programmers, WWl PrOgEawmers, etc.
2. Operators: Card punching, Tape preparation :
3. Engineers:

4, Technicians:

5. Secretarial:

6. Administrative and Service

7. Others

Admittedly, this breakdown is arbitrary and somewhat inadequate for all types
of computing facilities; however, it does serve to minimize verbiage and to
permit a more direct comparison of costs.

The annual cost indicated for each category in Table I is based on
the actual annual salary but does not include DIC overhead charges. As a
matter of fact, it must be emphasized that these salary costs are approxi-
mations rather tham actual rates (except for RDA and Statistical Services).
These approximations are due (in part) to the fact that certain project
leaders were reluctant to release actual salaries; in other cases it was
impossible to determine the exact cost because of fluctuations and part-time
assignzents of the participating personnel. Some of the larger projects
were not able to clearly define their operating costs.

Application and Utilization of Computers

The preceding discussion reveals that the operation of a computing
facility is expensive -- particularly if the installation is large. The
following questions naturally arise: :

1. Whet is the load factor on each facility?

3. What is the distribution of the work load -- academic use,
administrative use, DIC research, military application, etc?

3. How are the costs allocated to the user?

4. What is the replacement cost for sack facility?

Table II contains a breakdown of computer uti ization, cost allocation and
replacement expense. Inspection of this table will reveal that many approxi-
mations have, of necessity, been made.

The following sections contain additional information which ig
pertinent to a particular facility.

Aeronautics and Transonic Alrcraft Control Group

This computing facility is actually & combined computer consisting
of Philbrick computing equipment originally purchased by Prof. W. McEay (for
educational use in the Aeronautics Dept.) and the more-recently purchased
equipment obtained by the Tramnsonic Aircraft Control Project (TAC) headed by
Mr. Tom Parsons. The equipment is utilized by both groups and maintained by
the TAC group. The replacement value of the facility is approximately $30,000,
and the operating budget is also $30,000.

Dynamic Analysis Contrd Laboratory (DACL)

The operational statistics for DACL were obtained from Dr. W. Seifert.
These data represent the activities of the Systems Analysis Group which con-
stitutes 50% of DACL. Again, the exact distribution and cleavage of operating
personnel presents some uncertainty in the determination of the utilization
and cost allocation of the DACL computer. It is well to emphasize that the
annual salaries for each type of individual do not include the usual DIC
overhead charge. If the overhead charges are included (since they actually do
exist), the annual budget for the Systems Analysis Group is approximately $550,000.

Electrical Engineering Dept. REAC

The operational statistics pertaining to the E. E. REAC located
in Bldg. 32 were obtained from Mr. George Newton, and they represent the
activities based on 9-months of operation. (The computer was installed in
June, 1953). Since this REAC is used largely by students on a Self-Service
basis, and no operating staff are provided, the resulting annual operating
costs are fantastically low ($1600). Admittedly, the computer is still new
and maintenance costs have not assumed their steady-state value.

Instrumentation Laboratory REAC

The operational statistics pertaining to the REAC located in the
Whittemore Bldg. were obtained from Mr. H. Laning, and they represent the
activities for a typical year of operation. (This REAC was installed in
1950, hence maintenance costs now are quite realistic -- $12,000 per year).
This REAC is used by various members of the staff of the Instrumentation
Laboratory in a classified area. Since the actual number and type of
operators varies from month-to-month, no attempt was made to include their
salaries in the operating costs. Two part-time engineers are available to
maintain end assist the users in the operation of this computer.

Instrumentation Laboratory High-Speed Simulator

There are 4 engineers and 3 technicians associated with the opera-
tion and development of new components for this computer. Since this equip-
ment is a special-purpose device, it requires skilled operators, and the
attendant operating cost is $60,000 per year. This computer is used effectively
as a tool for the study of certain types of system-control problems.

Instrumentation Laboratory Desk Computing Group

There are approximately 18 persons engaged in the operation of
conventional Friden, Marchant, and Monroe calculators in various groups at
the Instrumentation Laboratory. Incidentally, the size of this group hes
been reduced from the previous number of 28 to the present size of 18 by
the self-service utilisation of the Card Programmed Calculator located in
the M.X.T. Office of Statistical Services. The cost of operating the present
staff of 18 persons is $45,000 per year.

Rockefeller Differential Analyzer (RDA)

The RDA has been subsidized by the Instrumentation Laboratory
since October 30, 1950 and is used almost exclusively for this group.
There are 4 full-time personnel associated with the maintenance and operation
of RDA. Im addition to the operation of the computer, a limited amount of
development work has been performed. Specifically, a Vector Unit has been
completed and inshlled during the past year. This device will permit the
solution of more complicated 3-dimensional pursuit problems.

In accordance with the terms of the meeting held in Dr. Stratton's
office on January 21, 1954, the operating staff of RDA were informed on
February 2, 1954 that the RDA facility would be closed effective July 1, 1954 --

pending delivery of the Card Programmed Calculator which has been ordered by
the Instrumentation Laboratory.

Several alternative -methods for disposing of RDA have been suggested;
however, no definite decision has been reached regarding its disposition. This

action should be initiated in the very near future while existing manpower
is still available. i

Office of Statistical Services

The operation of the 0.8.8. differs from the previously-described
facilities in several respects. First, it is a service group which serves
the needs of the entire MIT family, and, as such, the following functions are
performed:

1. MNechanization of Administrative Activities,
2. Scientific Computation for Academic and DIC Projects,
3. Educational Teaching and Research.

Second, the operating costs of this office are recovered by a cost alloca-
tion system which charges the customer for the use of the facility. IBM
computing equipment is utilized and the operating costs reflect the IBM
rental charges. During the past year, a very effective Self-Service mode

of operationims been applied to the operation of the Card Programmed
Calculator (CPC). The success of the method of operation is evidenced by
the fact that the need for the CPC has increased to the extent that a

second CPC has been ordered for use by the Instrumentation Laboratory.

In addition, an IBM Type 650 Drum Calculator has been ordered and is expected
to arrive sometime in 19585.

Whirlwind Computer (WWl)

The statistics pertaining to Whirlwind were obtained from

Messrs. Jack Porter and Robert Nelson of the WW1l staff. Since the sub-
mitted data applied to the activities of the Scientific and Engineering
Computation Group (SEC) (DIC 8345), which represents about 20% of Whirlwind
application time, & number of simplifying assumptions and approximations
were made in the determination of existing operating costs. Statistics
representing the utilization of WWl by the SEC group were obtained from the
biweekly progress reports for 1983.

Conclusion

The preceding sections con
tain certain pertinent information
r
earaing me operation of various computational facilities at M.I.T. The
early one, in particular Tables I and II, contain data arranged in

EO form which minimizes verbiage. Succeeding sections contain addi-
oneal date of an explanatory nature.

? The purpose of this report is to present a2 brief summary of certain
of the operational aspects of the larger computing facilities. It is hoped
that adequate data has been presented to provide a basis for succeeding

administrative decisions which are involved in the formulation of a long-
range M.I.T. computational program.
