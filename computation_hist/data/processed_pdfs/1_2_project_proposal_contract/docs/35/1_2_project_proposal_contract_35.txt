1 Dear Bix:

In accerdance with reeent discussions between WADC and MIT
technical personmel, there le forwarded herewith a revieed proposal
for & 12 months! extensien of The reference contrast starting
January 1, 1958, witheut additional funds. Thie proposal supersedes
sur proposal forwarded by letter dated March 10, 1958.

It is recomménded that the proposed research progres eR-
sles of the following studies and investigations:

1. A study of bouadary-value and eigeavalue problems whish
are frequently encountered in the solution of ordimary
differential equations. The proposed study will eem-
glider msthods of solution amenable for sclutiomr by
aeens of the differential analyzer, the REA, and ether
digital machines.

9. Ap investigation of the feasibility of solving integral
equations efficisntly by means of eomputing equipment.

9. An javestigation of the solution of certain types ef
glgebraie equations (¢.g.,; the solution of simul taneous
equations wilh 41i-conditioned matrices, evaluation of
sheracteristias roots of matriess, 6%...) by means of
available somputing equipment.

&. A study of the variavion determination of simply ans
1ytie wave TuNSTiONE;] for use ia the calsculatiom of
{onization potentials, multiplet separations, radiation
intensities, and other properties of atoms eontalming
is, 28 and 2p elegirons.

he Gontragtor shall contimue to submit quarterly progress
reports and WADO ¥ashni cal Reports on the above work.
