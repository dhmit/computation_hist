Dear Professor Morse:
Early this month I wrote to Dr. Stratton (see attached copy) asking
about the feasibility of a certain application of your 704 to a

problem of ours.

On December 1 and 2 I plan to be in Boston and will phone you in
the hope that you may want to talk about what we have in mind.

Yours very truly,

Th

hn F. Bolger,
President
