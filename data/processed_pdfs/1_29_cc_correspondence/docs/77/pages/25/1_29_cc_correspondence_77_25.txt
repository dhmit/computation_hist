subfields of the variable field are evaluated consecutively
from left to right. 1If n, is the bit count of the first
subfield then the value of that field is placed in the
leftmost n, bits of the machine word generated. 1If n, is
less than the length of the data, only the rightmost n,

bits of the data are used. 1If ny is greater than the length
of the data, then the data is placed in the rightmost bit-
positions of the set of n, bits and the left-hand bits

are all made zeros. The value of the second subfield is

placed in the n_st through (n1+n2-l)st bit positions

(counting the sign bit as bit-position O, in a similar
manner). The total of all the bit-counts must not exceed
36. If this total is less than 36, the right-hand bits
left over are made zeros. If a symbolic-expression sub-
field contains a relocatable or common expression, that
subfield must be placed so that its rightmost bit is the
17-th bit (i.e. the right-hand bit of the decrement-

portion) or the last bit (i.e. the right-hand bit of the

 

address-portion) of the word. As an example, suppose
the programmer would like to break up a single 36-bit

word into four parts as follows:

1. Positions O - 9: the binary equivalent of the
decimal integer 895.

2. Positions 10 - 14: the binary equivalent of the

octal integer 37.

3. Positions 15 - 20: the binary coded value for

the' character ''C".

4, Positions 21 - 35: the(binary) value of the
symbol ALPHA.

Then he may simply write:

LOCATION OP VARIABLE FIELD

VFD 10/895,05/37,H6/C,15/ALPHA
