',-ggglxibevelogment - The amount of training, both formal and in-
. formal, in the design and use of computing equipment has always
 peen closely related to the availability of such equipment, at
- the Institute., It was available here quite early because of the
interest of Vannevar Bush and his students. The Electrical Engl-
neering Department had mos® of this equipment before 19405 a
 Differential Analyzer, a Network Analyzer and others.“fhe few
courses concerned with machine computer design and use were B:. B.
courses and were attended chiefly by E. E. majors. AS the equip-
ment increased in effectiveness, however, staff and students of
other Departments became interested until, by 1940, at least half
of the 24 attendees of 6.60 Math--Anal. by Mechanical Methods
were from other Departments.

Since 1945, the Institute has added a great number of computing
devices to 1ts faclillties: Whirlwind, some I.B.M. equipment,
several large electronic analogue devices, and 80 on. Some of
these are in the Mechanlcal and Aeronautical Engilneering Depart-
ments, so that more students have close contact with their con-
struction and use. Because of the growing importance of such
equipment in engineering and seientific training, the Institute
set up an interdepartmental Committee on Numerical Analysis and

Machine Computation to coordinate the educational use of tis
