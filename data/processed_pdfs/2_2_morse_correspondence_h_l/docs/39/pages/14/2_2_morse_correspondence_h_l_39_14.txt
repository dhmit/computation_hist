Fig. 5. Cross section of central portion of cylindrical test assembly.

The sample was surrounded with a cylindrical layer of in-
sulating brick to increase the mean sample temperature.

Temperatures were measured with Pt-Pt-109, Rh ther-
mocouples; input to the test zone was measured with a watt-
meter. Thermal conductivity was calculated from equation
(3). The length of the test zone and the thermocouple diam-
eters were determined from radiographs.

The results obtained from measurements with two separate
spherical samples and two cylindrical samples are shown in
Fig. 7. For comparison the results of previous measurements
on the same material by other methods (see Parts IIT and IV)
are shown as the solid line.

lll. Discussion of Results

As can be seen in Fig. 7, the mean values obtained by both
the spherical test method and the cylindrical test method are
in close agreement with each other and with values previously
determined by a comparative method (see Part IV) and by a
prolate spheroidal envelope method (see Part I1I). These
results unequivocably demonstrate that equivalent results
can be obtained by various methods of measuring thermal con-
ductivity. |

[t must not be inferred that any method will give satis-
factory results. It has been many times demonstrated that
the most careful experimental technique is required to obtain
satisfactory results. Norton® has clearly shown the large
errors that can arise from quite small variations in experi-
mental conditions, and comparative results from various
laboratories (see Part I, this series, and footnote 1, this paper)
clearly indicate the difficulties inherent in measurements
of thermal conductivity. However, if precautions are observed
in design and operation of apparatus to secure a rigorously
correct pattern of heat flow, satisfactory methods of tempera-
ture measurements, and satisfactory methods of heat-flow
measurement, equivalent results can be obtained by various
methods.

Although the methods described here are thcorctud]]\
sound and lead to correct experimental results, they are not
recommended for general use. This is primarily due to the
difficulty in fabricating suitable specimens.,

IV. Conclusions

(1) Equipment, methods, and results are described for
measuring thermal conductivity at elevated temperatures
with spherical and cylindrical specimens.

(2) Results obtained for Al,O; by the two methods de-
scribed are in agreement with each other and with results pre-
viously obtained by two other methods.

(3) Thermal conductivity can be measured with equiva-
lent results by various methods and techniques.

Thermal Conductivity: VII, Analysis of Variation
ot Conductivity with Temperature

tor Al,O,, BeO, and MgO

by MALCOLM McQUARRIE

The results of previously published investigations
into the thermal conductivities of alumina, mag-
nesia, and beryllia by five different methods in
different temperature ranges are summarized in
the empirical equation k¢ = 4/(T — 125) + 85
X 10-%71° where 4 = 16.2 for alumina, 18.8
for magnesia, and 55.4 for beryllia; the equation
is valid (within about 109;) from room tempera-
ture to 1800°C. for alumina and magnesia and
from 1000° to 1800°C. for beryllia. The de-
parture from the reciprocal temperature law at
the higher temperatures (represented by the
second term in the equation) is believed to be due
to an increase in the apparent conductivity by the
passage of radiant energy through the translucent
specimens.

I. Introduction

T 15 the purpose of this paper to summarize the thermal
| conductivity results obtained for alumina, magnesia, and
beryllia over the temperature range room temperature to
1800° C. by five different methods: (1) a comparative method
(see Part IV, this series), (2) an electrical resistance prolate
spheroidal envelope method (Part III), (3) a spherical en-
velope method (Part VI), (4) a cylindrical envelope method
(Part VI), and (5) a pyrometer-induction prolate spheroidal
envelope method at high temperatures (Part V).

In this survey the author will examine the results, develop
an empirical equation for the variation of the thermal con-
ductivity with temperature, compare this variation with that
predicted by various theories, and present a theoretical basis
for the results at very high temperatures.

The combined results of the five methods are presented in
Fig. 1 (alumina), Fig. 2 (magnesia), and Fig. 3 (beryllia).
It can be seen that all three materials have relatively high
conductivities at low temperatures which decrease with in-
creasing temperature, reaching a minimum in the region
1300° to 1600°C. The conductivity of magnesia 1s about
109, higher than that of alumina at all temperatures whereas
that of beryllia is from 6 to 2 times that of alumina.
