Dear Professor Morse:

On a vielt to three of M.I.T.'s computing facilities Thursday
the wide difference in policy as to charge for machine-time was
made apparent to me.

Three gentlemen were up from the Du Pont company to get some
asslistance in solving 250 solutions of a couple of similtaneous
non-linear differential egquatione. We started at Whirlwind where
the present policy calls for no charge in solving an acceptable

roblem. The next stop was the Differential Analyzer where the

160.00 a day charge seemed reasonable encugh. The last facility
vigited was the Analogue Computer in DACL where the current pol-
icy calls for a charge of $300.00 per hour of mechine-time which
does include the programming and preparation of a finsl report.

This difference ie &t least partly due to the sponsorship of
these various cormputers and I imagine that Bureau of Ordinsnce or
Army Ordinance has tried to have some say in DACL's policy. Whirl-
wind on the other hand is not yet fully developed and these accep-
table problems are presumably aiding in its development and, there-
fore, the Whirlwind staff encourages them. There is also the fact
that DACL, having split off from Meteor proper, must now pay its
oWl WaY.

These factors have doubtless been considered at length by your
comuittee, but I must admit I was not able to offer the Du Pont
pecple a ratlional explanation for these discrepancies.

Sincerely yours,

WLA
