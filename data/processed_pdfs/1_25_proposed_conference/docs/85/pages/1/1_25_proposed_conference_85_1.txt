Dear Phil,

I am proposing to send a circular something like
the enclosed to every computing center on Roy Reeves' list,
and would be glad if you were to correct, amend or other-
wise change it before returning it to me for mimeographing,
if you agree with this course of action.

Sincerely yours,
G
