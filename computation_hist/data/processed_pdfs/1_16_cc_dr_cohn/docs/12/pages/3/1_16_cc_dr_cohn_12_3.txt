Q + 1 properly chosen units ul of KN. The set of Q + l vectors Rlu] will be
called a stability conﬁguration. The actual choice of the Q + 1 units u,, as we
shall indicate, is not only extremely difﬁcult, but it accentuates irregularities
in the inﬁnitesimal behavior of the units of KN for different N.

Nevertheless the ﬁnding of these Q + 1 vectorsu or Rlu] would be desirable
in view of the fact that a modular reduction theorem automatically enlarges the
“neighborhood" of a stable lattice (possibly to the whole lattice space, thus
establishing a critical lattice, as in the quadratic case (12, p, 268)), For instance,
take the following simple—looking set of n units of KN (for N prime > 5):

It is found by very laborious calculations (which we omit) that the resultii g
Q + l vectors Rlu] provide a stability conﬁguration when N = 5, 7, 13 bill
that these vectors are not even of rank Q when N = 11. The question ofivhether
or not the integer-module of KN provides a critical lattice for the norm in it real
dimensions is answered positively for N = 5, 7 (3), and negatively for N = ‘13
