to find a counterpart to work with in at least one computer specialist
with a real interest in applying the potentialities of digital computers
to social science problems, The lack of such a person to whom one could
feel free to turn with questions has been a real handicap, We have
bothered Murray Watson with a lot of our questions, but always with the
knowledge that he was involved in another project (the post mortem pro-
gram) and that we were imposing on him. The extent of the need for such
& counterpart is reflected in what has happened to Korbel and Cohen,
Korbel's advisor at Harvard has gotten IBM to assign one of their men to
spend some time with Korbel answering questions, going over his program
with him, etec. Cohen has developed a working arrangement with a fellow
in the Business School at Harvard to help him in the same way, I know
that you don't want to assign 2 person a2 task of this sort, and you should
not, I had assumed the existence in the project of a computer specialist
with an interest in applying his ability to problems of social seience,
As a matter of fact, I personally find it hard to understand the presence
here of the project without such a person,

Apart from the mainly organizational aspects discussed above, there
are several specific topics that the social science people here would
probably be interested in. One would be a discussion by a qualified
machine person of Max Palevsky's paper "An Approach to Digital Simulation®
in Proceedings of National Simulation Uonference, 1956, po, 18,1-18.4.
This would involve reasons for his assumption that analog computers have
advantages over digital computers in simulation, and whether this holds
true for social secience in view of the types of models that social scien-
tists have and can produce, To follow up on this latter line would prob-
ably require bringing in some outside social scientists for seminars., Tt
would also be interesting to know something of previous uses of the 70l
in similation, and, if the Bendix D18 is Superior for simmlation, what
are its characteristics, and how afficiently can the 70l simulate it?

A series of sessions on the nature and use of Monte Carlo methods
would be valuable,

Some of the problems of comminication between social scientists and
the mathematicians and machine specialists have apparently grown out of
the fact that there is a lack of understanding of some of the real dife
ferences between social science data and physical science data, The
lectures of Dr, Hildebrand that T heard were interesting and obviously
basic to many problems but had little relevance to the problems of social
sclience because at the present time the nature of social seience data
and problems is so divergent from mathematics and physical science prob-

lems, A discussion of the nature of the differences and their implica-
tions should be fruitful.
