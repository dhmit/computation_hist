Dear P .M.M. :

I trust you finally got home from Washington. My plane just made it
to Laguardia as the weather closed in.

The Clebsh-Gordan picture looks rather grim. Say 1 and l' are to be
combined to give L. Then for given magnetic quantum numbers m and m'
as well as for a given 1 and 1‘ there are a total of

(1+l') —!m+m'l+1

possible L‘s. This expression must be summed on m:lmls l, and m':
lm‘lg l‘, and then summed on 1 and 1' from Zero to some maximum value
which we wish to include in the table.

The leading term in the resultant sum goes as l5 (sob). A fractional
coefficient in front of this term can be gainedmg§ taking account of

the various symmetries of the C.—G.'s but this is immediately obliterated
as soon as you include half—integer angular momenta.

. : 9
Did I hear somebody say lmax 30.
Nick sends his warmest regards.

Sincerely,

MW
Manuel Rotenberg

P.S. There exists a ”Numerical Table of the C.—G. Coefficients" by
Albert Simon, Oak Ridge: ORNL-lYlB, up to l=l'=j/2. This seems
good enough for most problems feasible without a high speed
computer.
