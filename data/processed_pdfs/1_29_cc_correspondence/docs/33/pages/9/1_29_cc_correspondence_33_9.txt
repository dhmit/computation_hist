In addition, the programmer can use the followlng legical
numbers for perscnal tapes with his program:

S . — - e .-

A5 5 ciidD
B5 - 10

VI, Case Studies of 704 to 709 Transitions
To assist programmers in preparing programs for the 709,
a serieé of the more common situations will be analyzed. These
case studies which have been prepared by Miss Mar jorie Merwin
of the Center Staff do not exhaust all the possibilities but
should serve as a guide to the factors which must be taken into
account. Any conversion problems that do not appear to be
covered here may be discussed with Miss Judy oSpall of the Center
Staff (Room 26-15%, Ext. 4114).
In the following examples, an arrow indicates a change
because of the transition.
A. TFortran Source Language Conversion
No ma jor difficulties in conversion from the 704 to
the 709 confront the Fortran user whose decks are completely
in Fortran Source Language. In general, only a recompillatlon
1s necessary.
IFor efficlent running within the FMS Monitor OLystem,
it is advisable to prepare the proper Monitor cards and revise
the source program for complete tape-to-tape operation.

1. The present END card should be replaced by
one with only END on it, and the Monitor

control card LIST shouldiprecede each source
