Composed of the twenty-five characters pPreceding the
selected word, a Space, the initial letter of the se-
lected word, a Space and the twenty-five characters
following the selected word, for a total record size of
eighty characters. (The 80-character record length
was chosen because of the frequency of occurrence of
card length records in Computer applications. This
will insure that the sorting program normally pro-
vided by a manufacturer with his computer would be
usable by our system, eliminating the necessity of
Creating the most complex program of our system, )
f) If benefit can be gained by ''batching'' several card-
length records into each magnetic tape record to hold
the required number of tapes to a minimum, it would
be done here and the resultant records be written to
the output magnetic tape(s).

 

The next computer operation is the aforementioned sorting,
whose criterion will be the combination of the selected words and the
seven-digit sentence identifier., The output from the sorting opera-
tion will be the basic information for the concordance, a complete
dictionary, including a frequency count for each word, and a list of
singly-appearing words for special attention, 2

Printing of the various listings mentioned above would complete
the computer operations.

It is suggested that Book I of the Institutes be used as a first
set of data to provide a small-volume representative sample to test
the whole system. A small list of words to be omitted would serve
to test that portion of the input edit program as well as to limit the
volume of data produced and the Computer time necessary to produce

text will clarify any such reordering,
