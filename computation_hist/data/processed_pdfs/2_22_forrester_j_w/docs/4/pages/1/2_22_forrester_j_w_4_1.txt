MEMORANDUM TO: Professor Philip M. Morse
Room 6-107

FROM: Jay W. Forrester

SUBJECT: Senior gommteg ngxamgr

We are in need of a senior computer programmer who
is familiar with the design and usage of generalized programs,
assenbly programs, and such things on computers. Richard Bennett
is leaving us, and we need someone to take his place who has
both technical ability and the personality to fit into the
position as intermediary between our problems and the Computation
Center. We need to design new computing routines especially
suited to our industrial and economic simulation work.

If you have any suggestions, I would appreciate hearing
of them. I will be here on July 7, 8, 9, and 10 and after July 28.
