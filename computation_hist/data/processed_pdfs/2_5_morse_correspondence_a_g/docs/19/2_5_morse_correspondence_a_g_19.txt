Dear Mr. love:

This letter is in snow:- to your or November 1 to
Professor w. '1'. Moi-tin or the Bensrtment of Mathematics. The
Institute is of course were of the need for training persons
in the use of high-speed computing equipment. We have here sn
intensive progrsm of educstion in this field involving nearly
a. dozen courses, a spectrum of assistsntships and a professional
seminar in the subject. Consequently, I am not sure that we are
quite in the position of needing a "sales talk" as to the
importance of this field. We have one and will shortly have
two high-speed computers and our students have access to these
m‘schlnes. Consequently, s highly technical talk on specific
uses of machines or on special programs which might be used on
machines such as the IBM 70*} might be of interest in our
seminar. If one of your technicsl experts on machine use his
some material of this sort, we would be interested to have him
address our seminar some time in the Spring. Before we can
schedule such a talk, however, I would suggest that the person
who might come should write to me outlining the proposed sub-t
Ject matter and suggesting a possible title.

Sincere 1y ,
