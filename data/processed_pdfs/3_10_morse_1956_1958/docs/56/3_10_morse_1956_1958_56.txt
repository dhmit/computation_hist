Dear Frank:

I have read your December 29 paper on a "Financial Report of
the Digital Computer Laboratory'. The figures you present
are interesting and very informative. I have no comments of
any importance.

I believe you and Phil Morse both inquired about the allocation

of time from Brock, Everett and me. In looking over the dollar
figures, both on the basis of the amount of time these three spend
and how these compare with the total funds, the present alloca-
tion looks reasonable and proper.

Very truly yours,

Jay W. er
