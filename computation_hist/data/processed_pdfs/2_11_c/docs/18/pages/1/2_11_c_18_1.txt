re: INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTERS

Dear Professor Morse:

 

Dr. Locke has written to me that he has turned
the manuscript over to you, and I want you to know that
I am most appreciative for the trouble you have taken.
I merely want to take the time to write you now that
proper reviewer's fee will be paid.

Sincerely yours,

Steam CM
