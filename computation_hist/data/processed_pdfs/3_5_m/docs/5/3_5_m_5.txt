Dear Ir . Mar-sch:

Thanks very nueh for your prompt action in preparing the
invoices tor the 15m Corporation under our operating contracts with
the corporation. I would like to ask you to nuke a slight ohange in
future invoices; namely, 1 would like the names and salaries of
individuals deleted from future invoices. This is consistent with our
operating agreement and discussions held with lasers. Cusiok. Blackburn.
(lemon, and Vex-nub on October 23, 1957. At tut meeting it was agreed
tint Dr. Blackburn would be continmsly informed of the snlurtos and
rates or all participating personnel. However, the invoices as such
would not oontnin this information. It is furthermore desirable to avoid
a salary breakdown since the last invoice contains the salary or Prat. Horse
and this, of course, is something we need not inolude on any of our invoices.

I recommend that we retain the present format; however. merely
refer to salaries as follows: two key punch operators and one machine

operator on Paragraph 17, one key punch and one machine operator on Paragraph
18, and "staff salaries" on Paragraph 18.

sincerely yours ,

F. M. Verzuh
Assistant Director
