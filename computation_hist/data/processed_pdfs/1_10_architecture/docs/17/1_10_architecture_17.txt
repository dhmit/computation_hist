A discussion concemming the MeL. T. computation Center was held in our
offices on March 14, 1956, These present were:

Messrs, ar: MJ.F,Pzisrsoa and Trunan Hunisr raprosesting MoI, T,
and I, B. M, in Cambricge,

Messrs, Pavson Hunter, William Heising and Robart Anthoney (afternoon)
representing 1. Be M,

Messrs, Pat D'Eri and Anthony Tiliacos representing Syska k Hennessy,

Marsares, Sam Wertheimer and Saul Harber reprassuting Se Oe Me

Mr, Peterson suggested that we make studies for ventilating and alr con-
ditioning the I, Be M. Corputation Area on the following basisy

a, Two (Z) separate A, GC, units - one (1) for machine supply and ome (1)
for interior supply.

b, A combination of both systems into ons with two separate supply fans;
one (1) for machine supply and one (1) for interior supply.

Mr. Payson Hun'ex che cked ine space allocations asaingt ranutramaents
and found that {, BR, M, had a total of approximately 800 square feet more
than they requested for all tioors,

[here was some doubt expres sed by I, B,M, as te the actual need for a
dumbwaiter in the Machine Room, Mr, Payson Hanter will reconsider
the nead for and make a recommendation,

if ducts end cables are 0 be placed in the floor, 14' will be required be-
rwesn the steel plate and concreie slabs, This space gould be redwucad to
gn if gables alone were provided for, It was fait that the mechanical gn-

gineers would make thelr duct and cable layeuis based on the 8" dimension.
