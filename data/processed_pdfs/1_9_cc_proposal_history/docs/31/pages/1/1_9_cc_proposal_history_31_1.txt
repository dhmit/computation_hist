SURVEY OF M. I. T. COMPUTING MACHINES

INTRODUCTION:

At present there exist within the Institute many computing
machines of varying complexities., While this is not surprising
in view of the ever-growing need for computational facilities
in research, it appears that by and large these facilities are not
being fully utilized by the staff and student body of the Insti-
tute. It was with this state of affairs in mind that the
Committee on Machine Methods of Computation was formed to
"survey this situation, find whether the machines could be
integrated more closely wlth the main Institute activities,
training, and open research, and to implement this {ntegration."

As one of the steps in implementing this program, a survey
has been made of the various cmputing machine facilities, both
l√©rge and small, which are in use today at the Institute. This
is the subject of the following report.

It has been found more convenient to discuss the machilne
facilities by department. For one thing, a better view is
thereby obtained of the use to which the machines are being
put. For an over-all view, however, we have included in Table I
a 1ist of all the machines reported on herein. There is one
reservation to this remark. Some of the machines have speclal
additions designed for solutions of problems arising in con-
nection with particular physical systems, e.g., the Flight
Table which simulates the motion of airceraft. By themselves,

they are not eomputing devices and 80 are not included in Table I,
