repeatedly while the others are executed once only, then
it should be on a separate tape to minimize tape backspace
and search time. If one tape only is desired for chain
links, we suggest it be Bl, since all links go onto Bl

first as a result of Monitor processing.

a. Data and Common. Data may be passed from one link to
another by means of COMMON. Therefore, when it is
intended that data be used by the programs of two or
more links, the appropriate COMMON and EQUIVALENCE
statements must be written. If a link, A, in cores
is overwritten by the next link in sequence, the next
time link A is read in for execution, it will be in
the same form it was before its first execution. This
means that any program modification or storage of non-
COMMON data resulting from the first execution will
not exist for the second execution. In this connection,
it should be mentioned that FORTRAN compiled programs

do not cause program modifications.

 

b. Relative Constants. (For a description of this term,
see 709 FORTRAN Reference Manual.) As in the case of
main programs and subprograms within a link, relative
constant values may be passed on from one link to
another merely by placing them in COMMON. This means
that if I is used as a subscript in one link and its
value is defined in another, the appropriate COMMON
entries will assure the proper subscript values at

the time the subscript is used.
