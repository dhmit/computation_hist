The meeting is expected to last three days. It would be opened by
introductory remarks from Professor Morse and then be briefly addressed by the
Chairmen of the five sections. At this opening plenary session every participant
will be able to voice his opinion on matters appertaining to all subjects and not only
the one he is being asked to choose in this invitation. This should give the individual
sections enough material to work on during their own sessions the next day. On this
second day the sections will meet privately and prepare recommendations to be dis-
cussed at the final plenary session on the third day. On the final day the Chairmen
of the five sections will present their conclusions to the full meeting. The discussion
of these conclusions will, it is hoped, lead to firm recommendations to be embodied
in the conference report. The group drafting this final report should have an oppor-
tunity to meet and discuss its final form on the afternoon or evening of the third day.

The Organizing Committee hereby invites you to attend the conference.

Funds are available to pay a part of the travel expenses and per diem
of the participants. However, to have as broad a participation as possible with the
limited funds available, the Committee wishes to encourage participants to pay as
large a portion of their travel expenses and subsistence as they can charge to their
own travel funds or contract.

There is a provision in the budget of the conference to reimburse your

travel and subsistence claims if they do not exceed $
