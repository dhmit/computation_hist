Dear Jack:

The purpose of this letter is to make a formal request for
additional changes which should be made on the type 733 magnetic drum
unit here at the MIT Computation Center. Specifically, we have pre-
viously removed the blowers in the stationary portion of the 733 unit.
However, the two blowers still exist in the gate portion of the 733. As
a result, we find the sound level in the 704 room exceseively high and
wish to improve it by one of the following two suggestions: ’

1. By actually removing the two blowers and providing
suitable direct air flow connections using an
"accordion'’ type canvas duct arrangement as I
discussed with you. This appears to be the most
desirable solution since it will admit operating the
733 in either a closed or opened position.

2. A less desirable alternative would be to leave the
blowers in the machine, and operate them only
during the preventive maintenance period when the
gate is opened. This presents additional costly
alterations in the machine which do not appear to
be warranted jn my opinion.

I would very much appreciate your sending an RPQ request
through appropriate channels in the IBM Corporation to determine the
feasibility of the above suggestion.
