Dear Frank:

Many thanks for the cooperation and valuable
assistance which you and your staff have given in the
development of our generalized aerothermoelastic plate
solution. We have developed this program to the point
where useful and interesting results have been obtained.
Currently the working control program contains numerous
binary correction cards. After we return from the
symposium it will be necessary to consolidate by mak-
ing all the corrections in the symbolic program and
then reassembling.

During the last two weeks, in order to obtain
results for the symposium, we have used considerable machine
time in excess of that allotted. We regret that we have
been unable to estimate our machine time requirements more
accurately. We are grateful for your understanding in
this matter.

1 am sure that great interest will be generated
by our presentation of the novel manner in which the IBM
704 has been used. This aerothermoelastic problem is one
which must be solved before safe re-entry from satellite
or near satellite orbits can be accomplished. I will call
you upon my return from San Diego to inform you of the
response to this research.

Sincerely yours,

Se==ywe
