Dear Sir,

Application of Computers to Business

and Indusm

W Company is presently investigating the application of computers
to the problems of factory control. We are designing towards an integrated
system covering such aspects as production control, machine loading,
inventory control, estimating, payroll, sales analysis, etc.

This Company is typical of the larger industrial manufacturer of
this country who deals with small batches of items rather than a large
flow of any given item. Our problem therefore is certainly one of the
most difficult to solve, and we think one of the most essential to be
solved in the very near future. We realise that this problem has not yet
had a satisfactory solution in this country, and we tend to think that
there have been short-comings in some of the systems in use and proposed
in the United States. We are determined therefore to apply all our skill
and resources to this challenge and we would hope upon the completion of

 

data processing.

It would be of great assistance to me if I could have the benefit
of a discussion with yourselves during which we could perhaps consider the
present day approach to the problem. Perhaps at the same time you could

indicate what, in your opinion, represents a useful trend for the near
future.
