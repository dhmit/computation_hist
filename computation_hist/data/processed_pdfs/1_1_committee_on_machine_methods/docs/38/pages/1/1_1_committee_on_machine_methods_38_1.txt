_Department'e recommendation.

Fo__ester brought up the problem of IBM and RDA charges for
computation time for research, and questioned whether the proJect
supporting these machines could not also support a fraction of
research time in the manner similar to the Whirlwind arrangement.
Morse said he and Verzuh would try to work out an arrangement.

Feahbach brought up the question as to whether a full-time
analyst should not be added to the staff of the project to help get

computing problems into shape for machine oervice. No definite
