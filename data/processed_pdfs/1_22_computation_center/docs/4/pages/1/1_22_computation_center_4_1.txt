Saturday

Dear Laura:

We got here as planned, on the 
evening of 4th of July, after a very nice 
trip through the mountains around Ouray
and Silverton--and a very hot trip
from Aztec to Cuba (sic!) and then a run
of 60 miles over a 1 car wide mt
road which would have been fun except for the 
4th of July traffic! Hundreds & Hundreds going
back & forth -- one at each hairpin. We passed
2 cars gone over the edge & down 30 or so feet
just 1/2 hr. before we came along & then two cars
hit head on just ahead of us and we had to inch
out around them! So we arrived here slightly
exhausted but safe -- Yesterday I went to work (!)
and we went out to supper. This morning we
went down to the nearest pueblo -- San Ildefonso --
& met a friend of a friend & then to the nearest cliff
dwellings -- Frijoles -- and now are waiting
for the afternoon shower. Tomorrow we do a bit 
of climbing -- maybe.
