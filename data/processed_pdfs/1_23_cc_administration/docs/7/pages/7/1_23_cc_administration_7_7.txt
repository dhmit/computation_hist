Operational features of the revised assembly.

The public library tape should be mounted aa tape L, a blank
tape mounted as tape mounted as tape 3, and any private library
tapes requested mounted Wwith the numbers requested. These numbers
must be from 5 to 10. Otherwise the procedure is the same as

described in the UASAP writeup.
