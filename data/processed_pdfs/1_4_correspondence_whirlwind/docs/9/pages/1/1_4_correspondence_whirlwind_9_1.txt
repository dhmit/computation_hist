Dear Dr. Veyls

In accordance with our telephone conversation last week,
I am sending you our most recent estimate of plans and sosts of
operation of Whirlwind I for the next two years. This ecan be taken
up in two parts: the one conserning the operation of Whirlwind I
and the support of its necessary maintenance, programming and ad-
ministrative staff (DIC project 6345)3 the other concerning the
general research and training program designed to extend the use
of digital computers in scientific and engineering researsh at the
Institute (DIC projeet 6915).

Projest 0915 - Taking up the second part first; the goal
set up in our 8t proposals to ONR, to make faculty and students
awvare of the usefulness of high-speed digital computers by investi-
gating applications in many fields, is well on its way to attain-
ment. QGraduate students and faculty supervisors in most departments
of the Institute (Blology being the major exception) have investi-
gated applications of wachine methods to problems in their own
fields and are in the proesss of obtaining results worthy of pub-
lication in their own field's Jjournals. This part of the program
was originally set up for a yearly budget of $100,000, but the

rate was reduced to $80,000, at the request of ONR, before the
project had reached ite criginally plammed full strength. It is
now estimated that about $70,000 will remain in the budget of this
projeet by June 30, 16553 consequently, it will be able to continue,
at about 1ts present level of aetivity, for only one further year,
unless further funds are provided.

 

But it is guite possible that most of the aims of sush
a general research program will have been attained by June 1956
