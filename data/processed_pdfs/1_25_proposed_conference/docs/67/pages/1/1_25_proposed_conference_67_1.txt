Dear Dr. Buell:

We have hoped to have ag many small colleges
represented as have been active in machine computing in some
way, however small. We also hope that many of our discussions
would have direct bearing on the problems of startint computing
activity in small colleges. In other words, 1 agree that your
meeting would be more useful if it were held after ours.

We hope to have our sessions sometime in April,
1960 -- perhaps in Chicago just after the meeting of the
American Mathematical Society -- so the timing you mention
would fit. Professor Walter Freiberger of Brown University,
Providence, is the secretary of the committee organizing the
Director's meeting. It might be useful 1f you kept him informed
of your plans, S0 we can be sure that two separate meetings are
advisable and, if so, so the two can be coordinated.

As to the M.I.T. program, any accredited college
offering bachelor's degrees or high, which is interested
enough in computing to have its presldent appoint a faculty
representative, who can spend some time at the Center, 1is
eligible and welcome. We initlally invited about fifty to
join; to date, twenty-eight have taken part.

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse
Director
