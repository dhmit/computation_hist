The meeting wes taken up with a discussion of appli
ations for assistantships for next y=ar. It was decided to
continue assisiantshipes for next year for the following pres nt
holders of assistantships: N. H. Hicks and Phyllis A. Fox i:
Mathematics, S. Rubinow, F. J. Corbato, M. C, Newstein, L.
Sartori, and A. Temkin in Physics.

Tt was decided to make new appointments to Mr. J. ¥,
O'Donnell in the Chemical Engineering Department, to Messrs.
>. Aronson, R. L. Martino and A, Ralston in Mathematics and 0

in Mathematics and J, L. Uretsky, J. L. Lebowitz and RD. ©
Haun of Physics wers other promising candldates. Decision on
these last persons wae deferred untll the next meeting. Morse
nednwhile 18 to sce how many assistantships the present fund
gan afford naxt year. ; :

Morse reported that Professor Hildebrand has indicate
an interest in giving a first-term courses in Numerical Analysis
for seniors and first-vear graduate students, partially %o take
the place of Kopal's courses. It was suggested that perhaps
Dr, Grosch could give a second-term course, continuing the r1b-
ject and that the othér course in machine programming could 2e
tied in with theses. It was suggested that this would bes a vel
topic for the April meeting of the Committee.

Morse alco reported that Dr. Rubinow had complete. a
first draft of a survey of M.I.T. Computing Machines which 1as
to be distributed. After comments and suggestions had been re-

ceived on this fivst draft, the report would then be put ino
more permanent form if this appeared desirable.

It wae decided to have another meeting at 2 p.m.
