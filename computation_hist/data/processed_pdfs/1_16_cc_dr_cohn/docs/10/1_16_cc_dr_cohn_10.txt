A PERIODIC ALGORITHM FOR CUBIC FORMS II.*

By HARVEY Conn.

 

15 Introduction to Part II. In this continuation of our discusgiOn

of a cubic sign-discrimination algorithm, introduced in an earlier VOIHme of

this JOURNAL [7], we shall turn our attention to the computation of units.

First of all we shall show (leaning once more on the Minkowgkizm
algorithm) that all units are discoverable by the “neighbor PTOCess” of
Part 1 [7]’ pp. 829-833. In so doing we must restrict our lattice to a module
9)? of preferably (but not necessarily) all integers in a totally real cubic ﬁeld
5?. The ﬁeld 5? need not be abelian but the module Wt must be DOD-singular
(i. e., of dimension three over the rationals). The units would then lie in Q
the order of the module 311?.

Secondly we shall consider the manner in which the units should be
written. As we observed in [7], p. 833 certain 3 X 4 matrices are PTOPOr-
tional only under certain rearrangements of rows and columns. This makes
it desirable to have a hypercornplex notation, which also brings out normal
symmetries of the matrices.

In comparing our modiﬁed algorithm with its Minkowskian Progenitor-
we start with the realization that what we are doing is refining the algebraic
properties of the algorithm at the expense of the geometric properties, but
the algebraic simpliﬁcations make numerical work 1 more feasible while the
geometric complications make themselves felt only in existence type proofs
which are disposed of here. This dichotomy is illustrated in the geometric

and algebraic portions of the present work.

We shall classify the 24 neighbor possibilities (explained in 10 above) into

three types depending on the partition of the symbols serving as second and
third element in the neighbor operation:

LEMMA. Erory reduced metric; ¢ has either one or two (reduced)
neighbors of each type.

Outline of Proof. We must consider the subdivision into cases as deter-
mined by the relative magnitudes of each row: (i p11, l (14 t, 1r, ), l s; l),
(compare 11) There are actually twenty-four diiferent cases (to within
elementary interchanges of rows and columns and changes of sign in rows).
The details are omitted in the interests of brevity we simply remark that
this method was used in the (weaker) statement made earlier ['7], p. 830
that there are from three to six neighbors.

17. Occurrence of independent units. The units deduced from the
)Iinkowskian algorithm were “controllable” in the sense that if we take a
succession of neighbors to one Minkowskian triple by “lowering the same
face” (say a.) each time we would obtain a unit whose xi conjugate is less «
than unity and whose other conjugates are greater than unity in absolute
value. If units are formed corresponding to two different a, they are inde-
pendent by the classical argument of Dirichlet.

The same thing can he done here, except that the

Lemma 19. 3 below).

LEMMA 18. 3. Any two neighboring Minhoroskinn bases each overlap
overlapping reduced guadruplcs.

For it is the naturc of Minkowski’s neighbor concept, [3], that any two
neighboring triples overlap; but by the theorem in 5 these triples are con-
tained (discounting sign) in a reduced quadruple if they are bases.

Now we use the further information that any two Minkowskian triplcs
are connected by the h‘linkowski neighbor process. The proof is based on a
topological argument suggested by Minkowslri (and proved in [‘2]. p. 3-19).
Since every degenerate Minkowskian triple has nondegcneratc triples (i. 0..
basis triples) as neighbors, it takes very little eil'ort to deduce from the same
proof that any two Minkowskian bases are connected by a chain of )Iinkowskian
bases as neighbors. Hence the lemmas yield the following result and with it
the “discovcrability” of all units:

THEOREM. Any two reduced guadruplos can be connected by a chain of
neighboring (reduced) quadruplcs.

19. Proximity of algorithms. In Scction 5 (above) we showed that
”91'." Minlrowskian basis is part of a rcduocd quadruple, which manna in
('iii‘i‘t, that every Illrnlrorosl'imz lriplo overlaps a rozlucod quadruplr. The
“converse” seems to be ialsc, indicating that there are “more” reduced
«nuidruplcs than Minkowskian triples in some sense perhaps analogous to the
Sense that the quadratic algorithm we introduced in 2 (above), pmscssing
“ modianis “ in addition to regular convorgents of the simple continued frac-
tion contains “more ” rcduvod triples (see Section 25 below). Lemma 18. 2

determined from the group (310 of totally posrtive units as follows (compare

Note that for r: 8 the fundamental units are shown as conjugates of a
single unit while r=4 does not occur, in accordance with the conclusion
of 22 above. In this way we obtain a group 65* whose multiplication rules

can be given as follows:
(23. 5) (Z’ajE) (ZuakE’) = Z'WaiE'"
where E”= (EZ")E’ and a;=a,,Z‘“a,Z“.

Now, the only possible proportionalities that mix rows are those coming
from the group 65*, i. 9., based on units, for the cube of any element of (3*
is an element of 65, hence based on a scalar unit. (See section 21).

Case II: SUB equivalent to a. normal module. Here r=n2 or 8 and
every <1> is one of a set of 37/2 except when the 95 is proportional (row by row)
to one in which three of the quantities P, Q,R,S are conjugates. (In the
exceptional case (I) is one of a set of r/2 again).

In the table [7, p. 832] we ﬁnd evidence of some of these cases for
r= 8. Case I corresponds to A2 = 148, while Case 11 (or its exception)
corresponds to the proportionality classes that occur by twelves (or by fours).
Note that the module for A2 = 196 is neither an ideal nor normal, yet the
correspondence “ by fours” means it must be proportional to a normal
module (with even a normal basis). The numerical work is being carried
much further than in Part I, but it will be the subject of a separate report.

25. Concluding remarks. In Part I, Section 2, a modiﬁed quadratic
simple continued fraction algorithm was outlined. It turns out to be more
conventional than ﬁrst thought, in fact it is equivalent to the continued
fraction algorithm with the “ mediant ” fractions thrown in. The geometrical
Construction given in 2 can be seen to be a variation of Smith’s construction
[10].

In Part III, the concluding portion, we shall treat the algorithm as a
means of discovering “ small norms ” (analogously with the Pell Equation).
