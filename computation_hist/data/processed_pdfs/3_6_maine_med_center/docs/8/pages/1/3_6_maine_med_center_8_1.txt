It is always difficult to calculate a potential field distribution, even in relatively
simple physical systems, unless considerable approximations are made. This
is particularly true if the system involves electrical inhomogeneities or if the
boundary of the system is not a simple geometrical shape. Itisusually possible,
however, to set up a model of the system and make rapid measurements of the
potential field.

 

Fig. 1. Diagram of two-dimensional conductivity tank. The outline of the chest wall, lungs, heart,
vertebra and sternum can be seen. The two electrodes at the centre of the cross-section of the
heart are the source electrodes. The search electrode is carried on a bridge, to the right, and
can be moved to any position in the tank. The reference electrode is seen immediately behind
the vertebra. The cross-section is taken at the mid-ventricular level.

An electrolytic tank for conductivity measurements, as described by
Boothroyd, Cherry & Makar (1949), was modified (Fig. 1) so as to have an
insulating boundary in the shape of the outline of a cross-section of the human
thorax (adapted from cross-section diagram 23 of Morton, Truex & Kellner
(1941)).
