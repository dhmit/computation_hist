Subject: A break-point Subroutine for the Operator Program

 

A method for automatically inserting and removing
break-points in a users program should be provided by the operator
program, It is proposed that this be done by defining a SAP
pseudo-instruction called BKP, A break-point request deck would
have the form: '

BKPTSR, 'LIB Break; point subroutine
f
SYMBOL,%BKP A,0,B Break point request
|
?RA C Starting address of users program
B, ' Arbitrary program containing out-

put requests and the terminating

instruction, TRA RESTOR, where

RESTOR is a symbol of defined in
\ BKPTSR

END BKPTSR

- BKP is a macro-=instruction which generates the
following sequence of words during the SAP first passs

(Loc) SXD BKPTSR + n,k
IXA x + 2,4
TTR BKPTSR + m
SYMBOL, PZE A,0,B

TTR & =4
where n and m are fixed integers.

The users program i8 begun by entering BKPTSR which
places C(A) in LOC + 5 and TTR LOC in A, and then transfers
control to C.
