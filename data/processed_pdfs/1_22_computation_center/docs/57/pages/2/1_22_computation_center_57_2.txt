Dear Ray:

I enclose copies of part of the first draft of
our first Progress Report. Pinal copies will be sent to
NSF, but they may not get to you in time â‚¬o use in your
talk, so I am sending you these. They probably will be
changed some in the final Copy, but they should give you
the general picture.

I am trying to get pictures of the machine room
taken this week; the machines were put in place last week.
If they can be taken soon, 1'1l1l send you some prints, from
which I hope you can get some slides!

Yours,

Philip M. Morse
Director
