Dear Frank:
- Encloeeiia an annuuncement for the Industrial

Dynamics Sumner Session which will operate during g‘the 1m
two weeks of August as it did last year.‘ ,

i presume that it is unneeeasarily early to file ‘
a formal request for cbmputer time but I thought it well ,to
let you know that we will be needing use of the 70!. during
that period probably for ehbrt intervals in the afternoons.

Sincerely,

industrial dynamics

massachusetts institute of technology summer session august 17 through august 28, 1959


Thus far, management education and
management practice have been com-
partmentalized into such classic
subdivisions as finance, marketing. pro-
duction. and accounting. However, the
major problems of the industrial manager
arise not so much from the separate
components of the company as from how
these interact to produce instability in
prices. production, employment, and
profits. Building on the development of
electronic computers, on military advances
in understanding decisionrmaking and in
using simulation to solve complex sys-
tems. and on twenty years of researchrin
feedback control systems. we may now
develop new ways to analyze the indus—
trial enterprise Management is on the
verge of a major breakthrough in under-
standing how industrial company success
depends on the Interaction between
flows of information (including policies
and decisions), materials, money, man,
power. and capital equipment. To help
provide a basis from which to understand
the forces causing industrial fluctuation,
growth, stability, and decline, the Mas-
sachusetts Institute of Technology
School of Industrial Management will
offer a two-week Special Summer
Program on Industrial Dynamics from
Monday, August 17. through Friday,
August 28, 1959.

Outline of Program

This Special Summer Program will
describe new methods of analyzing how
organizational structure, policies, decision
criteria, information distortion, and time
lags in information and material flow
may affect the course of industrial
growth. cause fluctuation in sales,
accentuate seasonal tendencies, and
amplify external economic conditions,
Models of industrial company operation
will be formulated for digital computer
solution.

This Special Summer Program results

uate teaching in the dynamics of eco
nomic systems, company functions. and
corporate policies, and in programming
computers for industrial-dynamic analy-
ses. For a more complete description of

for DecisionrMakers” by Professor Jay

This will be an intensive session devoted
to method, rather than a descriptive sur-
vey course. It is intended primarily for the
executive, to give him sufficient under-
standing to judge the usefulness of the
approach for his own company, The
management science specialist or the
management school faculty member will
find that the Program provides a baSis
for further work, but it is not sufficient
preparation for immediate use of this new
approach to management problems.

offered. Exercises will be held from 9 to

12 and 2 to 5, Mondays through Fridays.

The Program can accept only a limited
number of participants, Applicants must
have a Wide interest in and experience
with the problems of the company as a
whole and the interaction of the separate
industrial functions of research, engi-
neering, production, marketing, and
finance. Preference Will be given to those
who have had mathematics (through dif-
ferential equations). an introduction to
digital computer programming, and pracr
tical or educational contact With feed;
back control systems. Applications should
show industrial experience and the
extent of training in mathematics, digital
computation, and feedback control.

Staff

This Program is under the direction of
Dr. Jay W. Forrester, Professor of Indus-
