nee! lenny:

I s- snclosing e short note on the Ioditicetion of the [BI 704
which we would like to put into eiteot. The Isle indicstes sole or the
my interesting npplicntiens which can be worked on it the noduiestion
one he done. Io had thought originnlly o: noting the nechine sediticntion
ourselves but we u'e s little hesitsnt about getting into the nechine and
possibly holding up operation for a while. Io now understand that the
loditicntion we desire he been Iede e etsndnrd one which is nvuilsble to
the 704 customers upon appropriste pnylent.

I should think that the standerd IBI lodiriehtien would he the
desirshle wny oi asking this change but the standard l3! price is out of
our reech. I hesitste to ask Mario's division to 0.3. the donation
since it is lore for research than it ie for purely educational uses (it
you can ever sop-rate these two). At sny rote, it you teel this would be
e desirable thing, for us to hove your support or our request, through
Shade: to DeCarlo, it would he â€œloo-ed. The reason we feel urgent about
it is thst a couple 0: the researchers who would like to use this device
ere PhJ. theeee end, it we have no hope of making the nodiiicntion noon,
the grsduete students will nuke their part of the equipment fit none
other Inohine which will reduce our flexibility later.

You have probebly heard that our Joint conrerence will be held
on lriday, December 20. '9 hope you can come here that day. It you do,
we can talk to you iurther about this matter.

Yours ,
