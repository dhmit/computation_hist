Dear Phil:

The proposal for support of Research on Digital Com—
puter Operation and Research, of which you sent me an advance
copy, has arrived. '

An adnﬁnistrative difficulty has arisen because of the
lack of breakdown of the budget requested of NSF and ONR. In
order to get on with the processing, a letter indicating what
is requested of NSF and how it is broken into budget items will
be most helpful.

Sincerely yours,

dim
