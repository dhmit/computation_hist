Cambridge, Massachusetts

Dear Dr. Pusey:

| It is with a great deal of pleas ure that 1 enclose our check
for $495.00 representing the first semester portion of the stipend
for the IBM Research Assistant recently appointed for the 1959-60
school year in connection with the M,1.T. Computation Center. A
detailed description of the appointment is attached.

The increasing use of the IBM 704 Computer at M.I1.T.
by the New England colleges both as an educational device and a
research tool has been very encouraging to IBM, and we are delighted
that Harvard is having an active past in it as represented by these

research appointments.
