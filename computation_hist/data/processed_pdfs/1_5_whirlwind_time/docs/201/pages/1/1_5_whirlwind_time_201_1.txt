Dear Mr., Porter:

Mr. McCue has told me of some of the conversations he has had with
you concerning the request by Mr. Arenberg to perform certain calcula-
tions for optimizing the design of solid delay lines on Whirlwind I,

The following comments may be helpful in further specifying the position
of Lincoln Laboratory in the matter.

We have in the past ordered such delay lines from Mr. Arenberg and
have been satisfied with the units delivered. At the moment, so far as
I know, we have no orders outstanding with him. We are in agreement as
to the importance of such delay lines in military equipment and the pos-
sible benefit to be had by such calculations as outlined. I feel, how-
ever, that a specific justification for the work, as opposed to such a
general statement as the above, should come from military orders or con-
tracts now held by Mr, Arenberg. In other words, we are in sympathy with
the value and appropriateness of the problem, but do not wish any impres-
sion to exist that it is placed on Whirlwind (if this is the outcome) just
because Lincoln asked for it.

If there is anything further that I can contribute, please do not
hesitate to call on me,

Sincerely yours

LV Ll Yoot
