one must be the
the foreign patents n
not readily searctlth ,
always in jeopar y.

It is estimated that 60}; of the l e

torneys poring

and industry at home and abroad is producing
new facts, scientific reports and patent informa—
tion at a rate beyond the capacity of procedures

which served our fathers well.
These facts are obvious to the patent expert
but are not appreciated by the general public, for
whose welfare the system was established.
Equally, the serious situation now facing theU. 5.
Patent Office today is not being generally rec—
ognized although some of the difficulties had been
pointed out to the Appropriations SubCommittees
of both House and Senate during the hearings
held in connection with the 1955 Patent Office
appropriation hearings. The Office has a force
of approximately 700 examiners struggling to
keep abreast of these mountains of knowledge.
Despite their efforts, there are more than 200,-
000 applications awaiting action, and the present
staff is unable to keep the size of this backlog
from increasing.

The Examination Process

in order to illustrate some of the spe-
c1fic problems involved, we will follow
the prosecution of a simple patent appli—

cation before an examiner in the Patent
Office in some detail.

 

An Illustrative Applicatioh

Exhibit 1 shows the drawings of an ap.
plicatiOn which has recently matured into
a U. 8. Patent (2).

This application was for “an ornamental
d necklace" In this applicatim the

individual beads were disclosed as being

connected to one another by separable
fasteners the two parts of whichwere each
integral with each one of the beads
Hence the necklace could be taken apart
at any joint, and beads added or taken
out, so that the length of the necklace
could be changed, or beads of different
types, colors, etc., could be alternatively
utilized in making up the necklace. ,

The Speciﬁcation

As required by the Patent OffiCe Rules
of Practice, the application contained a
complete description of the alleged inven.
tions, knOWn as the WWhich re.
ferred to the drawing as it described the
several different embodiments of the pat-
entee’s idea. The specification of this
application is reproduced here,

1 This invention relates toornamental beads and
similar bodies and its object is to provide an im-
proved means of connecting or linking such
bodies together, for example, to make upastring
of beads.

2 According to this invention, at least one ofa
pair of bodies which are to be joined together is
formed of resilient material; one of the pair is"
provided with a neck carrying a head and the
other is formed with a socket which is entered
through a mouth of smaller cross-section than
the socket interior, the head on one body wig
mouth on the other being so shaped and dimen-
sioned in relation to one another that the head will
not ordinarily pass through the mouth but. due
to the resilience of said resilient material. can
be forced through with a snap action when it is
desired to join two bodies together.

a The invention is particularly applicable tothe
making up of a String of beads. Each bead HWY,
be provided with a head at one end and a 500W
at the other so that a string can be made “PW
a number of such beads. ,

4 Preferably each of the bodies to be 30'1“
m0ulded from synthetic plastic material SHC
leelhylene and may have the neck an
formed integrally with the main partofthebOd'
