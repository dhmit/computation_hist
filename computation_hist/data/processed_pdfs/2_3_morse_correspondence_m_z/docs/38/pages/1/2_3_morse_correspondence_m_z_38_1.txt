DeaR RR. McCandleaa:

v: Your unationnaire hardly applies to M. I T.: we have been »

r,deaigning and using_mach1nea of all types s1nce 1936. we hava more

vthan 25 computing machinee of substantially greater comp11o3t1on v
than a desk computer, some of them analogue, some digital. We are
bu11d1ng :more and W111 buy more. But we do not 1ntend to buy more
avery large machines. We feel that companies should ggye us large
,machines, ae their contribution to the vggy difficult Eisk of
'training- enough engineeRs with knowledge of machine behavior. For‘ .
Vexanple, IBM is donating a 704, to be installed next fa11,free of ~
char 6, for education and general research. If you feel that Btu—
aenﬁs should also have contact with analogue machines during their
tra1n1ng, perhaps you should donate one of your best machines.

We are doing our best to educate our undergraduates and
graduates in computer practice.r We could do better if we had more
machines. Can you help?

Sincerely,

Philip R. Morse, Director
