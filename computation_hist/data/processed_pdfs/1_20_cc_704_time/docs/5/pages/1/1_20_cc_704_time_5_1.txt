INTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM
To: Professor Philip M. Morse
From: Dr. Arthur L. Loeb

SUBJECT: Electophoresis Problem on the IBM-70L Computer

Last summer we discussed the possibility of running a
problem in electrophoresis of colloid particles on the IBM=70) computer;
I started on a machine analysis of this problem during my leave of absence
from M.I.T., spent at the University of Utrecht, in the Netherlands,
When we last talked about this, I proposed bringing my assistant at Utrecht,
P. Wieréﬁa, to MIT for a yeat to continue on the problem, and you suggested
thet if we find the facilities for inviting this man, computer time would
be available. At this point, we are considering inviting Wieréma as a
guest of our computer research group for the year 1957-58, but before
extending the invitation I should like to have a confirmation from you

regarding the availability of the computer next year,
