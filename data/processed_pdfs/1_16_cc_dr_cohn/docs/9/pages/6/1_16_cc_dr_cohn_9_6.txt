[I. IDENTIFICATION WITH MARKOFF’S FORMS

7. The form associated with a matrix

[n this section, we start out with the notation of §2 a',bove,‘i.e., with ‘fl’ B, - A
] nt. 11 arbitra;'y real, unimodular matrices. We define a form associated with
(ienfoélx;gthe fixed-point equation of the corresponding linear transformation,
A 1r

(2.2). Thus,
(7.1) ®,(x, y) = 012-’02 + (a-zz 3 au)li?/ — anl .
(Note that A and — A lead to different forms, although they have the same fixed
points). It is easy to verify that
(7.2) Bp-1,5(x, y) = ®4(@", "),
where, in accordance with an earlier notation,

T8 = bux + by

73
G '!/B e

The discriminant of the form &, is

(74) (a2 — an)’ + dapan = —4 + S(4)".

The form can also be written as follows:

(7.5)  au®4lz,y) =w' + i’ + S(A)yw where w = anx — auy.
Thus we define

(7.6) ats = (a5 + 1)/an ,

(bubze — buba = +1).

8. Final identification
We now restrict the me

satisfying the property: 8 modular matrices

(8.1) B7AT'BA = K, (where k = —6)
From the discussion of §6, (equation 6.3),

(8.2) an = ©(4)/3(= a).

Thus since an = —ax (mod a) and @ua» = 1 (mod ay), (by the definition of

trace and determinant respectively), we find that the value of a¥, defined in
(7.6) is an integer and the forms in equation (7.8) and (7.9) are equivalent in
the usual arithmetic sense.

To make use of the commutator property (8.1), we note that

—ayn  6an—ax

8.3) BAB = AK — <_“” 6““_‘“"’>,

and we obtain from it the form

(8.4) Pix-1(x, y) = —[(1211172 + (a2 — an)ry — 012?12] + banyxy — 6011?/2-
Hence,
(8.5) an®x-1(x, y) = —anPa(z, y) + 28(A)yy"

= —au®i(x", y).
Thus it follows that the four forms

(8.6) +[ + 5] + S A)yy"

are all equivalent. (Frobenius used the matrix F in precisely this way but he did
ot derive the forms from the simple commutator relationship, or for that mat-
ter from the fixed-points of matrices). :

Now Frobenius showed from the equivalence of these four forms that ax 18
