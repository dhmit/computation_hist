special coding courses which are given by the Center staff during
cach term and summer. A nunber of other collegen bring some of
their classes in for one or more laboratory sessivns, Clags use
will expand further, but its expansion will be haipered by the
linitations of access o the 704, as will be discussed later,

The use of the machine by the other celleges has expanded
rapidly until nearly a full shift is now cccupied with their work
(including their class exercises). But this use tencs to be self-
liniting for, as soon as a college faculty begins fully to apprec-
iate the possibilities in education and research of ccwputers, the
pressure builds up for a machine of their owa on thelr own campus.,
By now at least eight of the cooperatlng institutions hxve ma h;%NﬁMﬂMWh&)
of their own. These are smaller machines, of the 650 ty\QA so “
these instituions still come o the Center to use the 704 for their
bigzer jobs; but it does mean that the use of the Center 1y the
otaer New fngland ceclleges will tend to level off Lo a reejonable
load (aboubt one shift, it now appears) rather than growing sontin-
uously, as the LIT usage 1is d01ng I'nis result, of course, is in
accord with our conviction that computers shouvld be as preve'.=nt
as chemistry laboratories.

In contrast, the LIT use of the 704 for re:
