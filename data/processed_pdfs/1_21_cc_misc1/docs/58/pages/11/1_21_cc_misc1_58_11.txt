Supervisory and faculty staff, the other colleges have also con-
cributed faculty time. Machine time is free, though the user must
prepare his own coded program. To date faculty and students from

27 colleges and universities have used the facllities and 150 problems
are being or have been run, representing several dozen different
Scientific, engineering and academic fields., Details of the program are
are given in the appended Progress Report.

Here is a combination ideally suited for the prosecution of
research directed toward reducing the' "mismatch" between the machine
and the occasional user, All that is needed to start a vigorous
program are additional funds to augment the staff, which are at present
Too busy helping individual users to have time to work out the improved
techniques suggested by their present work. No money is needed for
machine rental or maintenance; this is already supplied by IBM. DNor
is money needed for machine operators or cardspunch operators. The
additional funds can be used entirely in suppérting the additional
staff needed to intensify the research on machine behavior and to work
out the improved techniques for machine use arising therefrom, and in
purchasing or constructing the special input-output eguipment which
will increase the machinels flexibility.

This special support need not be continued indefinitely. An
intensive program for three to five years should solve many of the
outstanding problems and enable the Center to drop back to its present
level of expenditure, but with a greatly enhanced utility to the
academic fraternity in New England because of the results of the
program. The results of the work will be lmmediately available to
the several hundred other TO4 installations and, with little additional
modification, to The users of other makes of digital computers. ‘
Present makes of digital computers have many more properties in common
than differences, and what is learned on one machine can be carried
over to the others without much modification.

Development of Utility Pro = In addition to assisting
individual users in putting Their problem on the machine, the Center
staff have the lmportant task of making the machine easier to use by
all users. It always takes time, the experience of many users, to
revaal all the capabiliities of any piece of machinery; this is
particularly true of high-speed computers. Because of their speed

and complexity it may take a dozen years or more before even the full
capabilities of our present machines are known, and by that ¢ime
machines of still more speed and complexity will be built. A computer
of the size of the 704 has an order of complexity such that its -—
designers literally are not aware of all of its capabilities. Con-
sequently it is important that research into these capabilities be
carrvied on; such research, revealing easier ways of obtaining results
and new methods of operation, may at times go farther in increasing
machine serviceabllity for the general user than can the providing of
a new machine with increased speed or capacity.
