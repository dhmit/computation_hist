1. It is a. hurts-year elective subject designed tor the
undergraduate,

2. It is a survey subject which covers numerical analysis,
analog mutation, and digital conputstien,

3. It provides the student with a general wedge 01 some
a: the nunsrical methods meessary to: machine amputation.

Admittedly, such a survey subject cannot be all inclusive, and because of

the large enroll-cut, it is no longer possible to provide ﬂue student with
actual physical contact with any counter.

Since 1953 this subject has turned out to be increasingly popular.
As a matter of fact, it is now offered both fall and spring terns. The
attendance is quite high. here were 106 students in 6.2% during the
Fall Tern 1955, and 47 students during the Spring Term 1956. This subject
offered at the undergraduate level enables students to decide whether they
are interested in taking additional subjects in this ares, and if they are,
there are 10 graduate subjects in which they any enroll.

 

Introduction 22 Digital Cﬂuter M and Iagic - 6.535

This subject was, as usual, again offered during the Spring Term 1956,
and there were 97 students enrolled. As a. result, it was necessary to divide
the subject into two sections taught by D. Arden and F. Helwig, respectively.

 

Because 0:: the large enroll-eat in this subject, no attempt was made
to make actual use of any computer. As a. matter of fact, the usual detailed
coding for the Whirlwind Computer was not presented, and students were not
allowed to use the conputer because of the large size of. the group. Since the
departure of Professor Adams, the content of the course has been changed
somewhat, and during the spring tern considerable emphasis has been devoted

to a study of the logical design of the internal system aspects of several
large conputers -- Whirlwind, N030, 831, etc.
