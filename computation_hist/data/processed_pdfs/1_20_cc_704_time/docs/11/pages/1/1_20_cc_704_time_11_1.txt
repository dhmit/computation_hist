Mr, Rudolf Eonig

Lynn Digital Computer Agtd,

West Lynn, Massachusetts

Dear Mr, Eonig:

I have a latter before me written by Mr, Alan Benson
countersigned by Dr, G, Grosch in which they indicate that there
would be some free time on the 704 computer at Lynn available for
academic purposes,

The purpose of this letter is to determine whether there is
any opportunity for the MIT Compuintion Center to enjoy this privilege?
Specifically, we are expecting our 704 the latter part of February,
1957; however, we are currently preparing a number of post-mortem
programs and other compiler-type routines which we would like very much
to be able to test out on the Lynn machine -- agsuming it is available
on a gratis basis,

I would very much appreciate hearing from you regarding the
availability of your facilities,

Sincerely yours,

F, M, Verzuh
Assistant Director
MIT Computation Center
