GA SPOT (Share Dist. No. 482). |
This is a program which runs on the 709 or

on the 704 with the 709 simulator MIOSIM.

The program only lists locations of all codes

£J

    
   
   
 

which are unique to the 704 as read from an

 
 

absolute binary deck of the object program.

   
    

 

3., RL 0209 (Share Dist. No. 557)
A 704 program which reads a 704 SAP program

        
    

and converts it to a 709 symbolic SCA'T' program.

          

for - -the 505 system. For example, RTB is

      
 

replaced by a calling sequence to an I-O

routine that will be attached to all programs
translated by RL 209. All CPY's also go into
a calling sequence to an I-0 routine, e

 
           
     
 
 

Caution: there are restrictilions.

SEQOAP 1s an assembler for the 709 that recognizes
the pseudo-ops of UASAP%-7 and all the machine instructions
of the 709; no operating system is included. Debugged programs
and some of the large systems are probably more easily con-
verted to the 709 via SEQAP.

To convert, remove all MITAOP commands such as
PRG OFF, LST, PMR, etc. and replace the 704 input and output
instructions or subroutines with the comparable 709 routines.

Undebugged programs should probably not be converted
to SEQAP since the use of the computer outside of a system is
time consuming: tape set-up and removal time is expended,
operator check-in and check-out is necessary, and the dumps
are usually more extensive than required since non-system

dumps are generally primitive.
