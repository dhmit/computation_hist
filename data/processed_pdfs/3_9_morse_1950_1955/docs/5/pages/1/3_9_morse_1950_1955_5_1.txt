RE: Pro!gscd IBM cn-gntigg contcr'gg_lxr

The purpose of thismemorandum is to comsider some of the factors involved in
operating a new MIT computing center containing a Type 704 EDPM machines and
other auxiliary IBM machines. It is assumed that the 704 will be used four
shifts; however, only two of these are to be used by MIT. The following cost
estimates are therefore confined to a two-shift mode of operation (80 hrs/wk).

POSSIBLE MEANS OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT

It is assumed that there will be no machine charges for the IBM Type 704
machine and that the present auxilixry machines in the Statistical Services will
be supported by the usual administrative appropriation ($17,198.00). It is
suggested that the present special machines (604 and CPC) be replaced by a
Type 650 Magnetic Drum Calculator. It will be used to solve certain classes of
small problems we are currently handling in the Statistical Services.

A consideration of the above-described budget reveals that 1,020 hrs, of
704 chargeable time (at $250/hr.) must be realized to recover ihe estimated budget
of $255,000,

There are a number of uncertein factors which strongly influence the above
recommendations:

1) The amount of "sister imstitution” utilization of the 704.

2) The amount of thesis and non-paying research conducted on the 7C4.
3) The amount of sponsored non-chargeable time used on the 704.

4) The volume of work done on the 650 and simpler machines.
