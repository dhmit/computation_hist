NOTE ON ALMOST-ALGEBRAIC NUMBERS
HARVEY COHN!

1. Introduction. According to a theorem of J. Liouville,? if 0 is
an algebraic number of degree #n, then any approximation by ra-
tionals, p/q, is of such a nature that

(1) 160 — p/q| = kg

for a positive constant k. Liouville constructed his transcendental
numbers as the limit of special sequences of rationals, p/g, which
violated condition (1) regardless of the values of k and 7, as g— ©.
Thus Liouville constructed almost-rational numbers.

E. Maillet® likewise found a lower bound for # —a where now 8 is
approximated by the quadratic numbers, a. He then violated his
lower bound by substituting for 6 the value of an almost periodic
simple continued fraction and for a a quadratic number, namely a
periodic simple continued fraction that 6 almost represented. Thus
he constructed an almost-quadratic transcendental.

It is an elementary matter to find a lower bound for § —«, where
we now approximate 0 by an algebraic number not necessarily ra-
tional or quadratic. We could then try several departures. We could,
for example, try to construct almost-cubic or almost-biquadratic
transcendentals.® On the other hand, we could use a diagonal method,
that is, we could consider the limit of a rapidly converging sequence
of algebraic numbers whose degree becomes indefinite. For example,
a root of a power series with rational coefficients is the limit of a se-
quence of (algebraic) roots of the partial sums, and the speed of con-
vergence is regulated by the remainder. If the remainder is too small
we find that the root of our power series can be approximated too
closely by algebraic numbers of varying degrees, namely the roots of

¢ For instance, E. Maillet, op. cit., pp. 22, 100, considers certain “rapidly converg-
ing” power series with rational coefficients and algebraic values of the argument. The
value of such a series is shown to be almost algebraic when regarded as the limit of the
algebraic partial sums (which lie in the field generated by the argument and therefore
are of no higher degree than the argument).

the partial sums. Thus the root of our power series must be transcen-
dental. By this method we can obtain some transcendental numbers

which seem to have previously escaped notice.

2. Approximation of a fixed algebraic number by an arbitrary alge-
braic number. We let 8 be a fixed algebraic number of degree # whose
denominator is fo, that is, 8 satisfies the equation with integral co-

efficients on + 10m +--+ 4 = 0.

We consider « the root of an arbitrary polynomial with integral coeffi-

cients Aah =n ft
Denoting max|fi| by 4 [¢(x)], we shall measure the closeness of «
to 8 by the smallness of ¢(0) in terms of 4 [¢p(x)].

Now setting (x) =fox™+fitox™ + - - + +folg, we find ¢(0) can be
written as & (100) /f", where £o0 is an algebraic integer. Thus if we multi-
ply ¢() by its conjugates, we obtain

(2) [160 = {IIo }/te = M[s®)]/ta

where M[¢(0)] is an integer. If ¢(0) #0, then the same inequality
holds for the conjugates of # and thus

(3) | M[e(0)]] 2 1.
For any conjugate of 8, we find easily
(4) | 60) | = A[p(2)]TY,

where 7 is a constant determined by 6.
Hence if ¢(0) #0, we obtain from (2), (3), and (4)

n—1 _m(n—1) mn

In short, if 0 is algebraic of degree n, then for an arbitrary polyno-
mial ¢(x) of degree m with integral coefficients no greater than A [¢(x)]
in absolute value,

where Ty depends only on 6. We should note in passing that if ¢(x)
= —p~-¢x, then (5) is Liouville's theorem.

3. Construction of transcendentals. We shall construct a power se-
ries o(x) =a +a,x 4-apxe2t - - (e;=0), where a; are rational
fractions r,/s; (0), and ¢; are increasing integral exponents. For sim-

plicity set ap=1. Let a4(x) be the hth partial sum (up to and including
the exponent ex). Then of the coefficients a; in ox(x) let gy be the
maximum |a;| (gx2=1) and let dx be the least common multiple of
the denominators s; in o4(x). Then if as h—s » €n41 1s of a higher order
of infinity® than es, log gs, and log d,, we find that o(x) is transcen-
dental for all algebraic x within its circle of convergence, except x =0.
To see this, let x take the algebraic value 6 of degree n within a
circle of convergence of radius p. We suppose E(o) to be an arbitrary
polynomial of degree k with integral coefficients of which the greatest
has the absolute value 4 [E(¢)]. Then we wish to show E(a(0)) #0.
First we write E(o(x)) as partial sum and remainder

E(o(x)) = E(on(x)) + Ra(a).

Now ¢5(x) =diE(ox(x)) is a polynomial of degree ke, with integral
coefficients. Its maximum coefficient 4 [¢p4(x)] easily satisfies the con-
dition

Alpa(®)] = dh AED ](h + 1's,

x=)

IA

dik + DA[E@) (kh + 1) er

since any coefficient in the polynomial x(x) is less than the value this
polynomial assumes when we replace each a; by g, and set x=1.

Furthermore, since E(o) has only a limited number of roots,
E(on(0)) can not vanish for all h. For, when & changes to +1, o(6)
changes by an.0° +, which approaches zero as k approaches infinity,
although this term never vanishes, 0 =0 having been excluded. Thus
by (5), for an infinity of values of #,

But since % can not exceed 2¢ (or even e;), we can simplify the last
inequality and obtain
—nk —(n-1)k _—ep

(6) | E(on(0)) | = dv 5,

where 77; depends only on 6 and on E(c) as a polynomial in o.
On the other hand Rx(6) =E(o(0)) —E(ax(f)) and, by elementary

considerations,
(7) | R(0) | £ Tu] o(8) — an(0) | = Ts! (9/p)1/(1 — 6/p) |
where 7% is determined by a(x) and E(e), independently of A.

5 If we have two quantities # and v each depending on k we say # is of a higher
order of infinity than v, if #/v— «© with A.

By our condition on the order of magnitude of es, it follows from
(6) and (7) that for some #, | E(a(8))] = | E(a4(8)) | - | Rx(0) | >0; and
(0) can not satisfy the algebraic equation E(c)=0. Q.E.D.

A simple method of satisfying the conditions on o(x) is to take
o1(x) =1+x" F224 « «fpf LL |x| <1. Then o,(x) and x are
not both algebraic unless x =0, and indeed, the values of x (#0) for
which a(x) is algebraic are some instances of the type of transcen-

dentals under discussion.
