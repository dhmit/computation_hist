Who has an “image” of a company’s personality?

Every company deals with a number of dlﬁerepﬁ
“publics”, or groups of people, whose good Wi

is of importance to the company. Each of these
various publics is likely to have a somewhat differ-
ent image of the company. Some of the publics
whose good will is most often of importance are:

a) The Consumers
b) The Trade
c) The Local Community
d) The Personnel
e) The Investing Public
These five groups of people are, in the final

analysis, the ones who decide how successful a
company will become.

This direct relationship between image and suc-
cess has received a great deal of attention in
recent years. Many companies are seriously at-

tempting to define their public image in te

its sales value. They realize that in o%der to Igrenr;e(c)f
their company image (perfection being measured
by lqng—term sales value) they must first find out
precisely how ghe public now looks upon their
con}pqny. In ';llljls difficult area of corporate self.

How can something as complex as a company’s
personality be evaluated scientifically?

A company image study necessarily deals on a
very high level of abstraction. For this reason a
company’s personality image has always been
difficult to assess—so much so that until very
recently it was considered impossible to evaluate
the image of a company in anything approach-
Ing a precise and systematic manner.

People responsible for a company’s reputation
have always realized that the personality of a
company, like the personality of a human being,
is n;ade up of many different dimensions, or
“traits”. The problem has always been to find
out what these personality traits are, and then
isolate them so that they can be studied one by
one.

the personality traits of a company

The solution to this problem is based upon recog-
nition of the fact that any personality trait of
importance to a company would certainly be cap-
able of expression by one or more words in the
English language. A comprehensive analysis was
