Dear Sir:

I have been authorized to credit your
account with 5 hours of machine time on the whirlwind
1 computer for Problem 159 which concerns the oper
ation of hydroelectric systems.

if you find that more computer time is needed,
it will be necessary to submit a new request.

i hope that these arrangements will prove
satisfactory.

Very truly yours,

vacx UV. Porter
