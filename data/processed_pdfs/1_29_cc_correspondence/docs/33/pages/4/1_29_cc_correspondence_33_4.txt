called SOS, was magnificently ambitious, sufficiently S0, that

the system is just beginning to assume complete and debugged
form over a year after the first 709 was delivered. Many
features of SOS are admirable; however, it 1s the consensus

of opinion at the Center that tTWO serious liabilities have

arisen:

5 The 1mprovement in problem formulation
technique by means of compillers is improving
p@pidly. Programming in overly-detailed
machine language with no provision for compilers
is not only an accident-prone procedure but
requires one to be a machine language specialist.

2. The Very elaborateness of the SOS system which
has pleased the expert programmers, has dis-
couraged the development of brief, concilse
programming manuals which are also self-contained.

In spite of these objections, the Center plans to have the 505
system available and be prepared to operate it for those who
feel it is a more effective system for their needs. The
programmer who intends to use this system will find it helpful
to familarize himself with the following material in the Center
Document Room. |
