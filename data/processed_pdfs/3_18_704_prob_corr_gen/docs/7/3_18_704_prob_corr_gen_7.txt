Mr. John F, Bolger, Jr.
President

6 North Michigan Avenue
Chicago 2, Ill.

Dear Mr. Bolger:

In response to your letter of November 11
addressed to Dr, Stratton, I suggest that you make an
appointment with Professor Philip M. Morse when you
are in Boston in December. Professor Morse is Director
of our Computation Center and I believe that either he
or his associates can give you the answer to your
question regarding the use of the 704 for the problem
that you propose.

Very sincerely yours
SPO nN)
