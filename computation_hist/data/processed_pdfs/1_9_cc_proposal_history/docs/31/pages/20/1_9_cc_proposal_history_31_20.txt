The 602A is elecﬁromechanical and performg the basic arithmetic
operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and dlvision.
In addition, it has provision for programming computations. It
will take 300 to 3000 cards per hour, depending on the com-
plexity of the problem involved. The numbers involved may be

as large as 12 decimal digits.

The 604 is an electronic calculator which uses a coded bilnary
number system internally although input and output are in the form
of decimal numbers. In addition to the basic arithmetlc operations
and progrémming, the 604 has a mechanism for comparison. The
speed of operation is a constant 100 cards per minute. However,
since each card may involve as many as 6 to 8 operations (multi-
plications, say), the machine is capable of performing close to
50,000 operations per hour. The machine will take either 5 or 10
decimal digits. The output is handled by a printer which has a
rate of printing of 100.cards per minute.

To facilitate the machine's versatility and flexibility,
about 15 permanent boards are wired up for immediate insertion
into the machines. Among these may be mentioned boards for'
special function generation, integration, correlation, polynomlal
evaluation, solution of simultaneous equations, inverslon of
matrices, etc.

Among the many types of problems that have been &treated
very recently for groups within M.I.T., are the following:

(1) Auto-and cross-correlation computations.
(2) Evaluation of characteristic roots of matrices.

(3) Solution of high-order polynomial equations.
