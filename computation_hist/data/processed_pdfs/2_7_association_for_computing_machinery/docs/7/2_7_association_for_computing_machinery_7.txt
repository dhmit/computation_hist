Dear Mr. Aucoin:

Many thanks for your letter of Mareh 16th telling me of the
availability of your IBM 704 computer on a rental basis.

In discussing this matier with some of my colleagues in the School
of Engineering, I learned that from time to time our staff takes advan-
tage of the opportunity you have outlined. The difficulty comes in
connection with the student need for computer time because these are
the people who ordinarily are without financial support. It is hard
to find a way to help these worthy users within the limits of M.I.T.'s
financial ability to pay-

Sincerely yours,

Gordon S. Brown, Dean
School of Engineering
