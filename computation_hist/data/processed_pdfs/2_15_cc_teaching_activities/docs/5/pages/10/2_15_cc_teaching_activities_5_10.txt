XXII. Solution of the Inventory Control Problem on the 650 Calculator

A basic 650 program was prepared for a salitied inventory
control problen. Specifically, the program was designed to
handle any umber of stock-numbered items up to 34.per-day items.
The pron-an was united to control and reporting of customer
products only. No attenpt was nade to control the conponent parts
for the itens. Sinilarly, no attenpt was node to report the raw
nateria‘l requirements.

XXIII. Study of Brokerage Accounting

A basic 650 prom was prepared for calculating the items
appearing in the transaction statement of a custoner's brokerage
account. The tollowinz itens were included in this study:

1. Co-ercial postage and insurance,
2. Federal transfer taxes,

, 3. State transier taxes,
4. s.t.c. tees.

Naturally a pregrsn or this type cannot be all inclusive and a
number or simplifying assumptions had to be nude to effect the
solution of the progran in a reasonable amount of tine.

A consideration of the above list reveals that a wide variety ox
problems were considered. It lust be emphasized that the latter group of
subjects were perform on a "torn paper" basis. That is, these studies
were performed on an individual basis, and elaborate reports were prepared
describing the problen statement, the actual 650 program, the results obtained,

and a. emery and evaluation of the paper. Although the term paper was expected
to require 30-40 hours or hens and laboratory work, the actual time put in by

the students varied enormously. For exalple, this tine ranged iron 30 hours
to 360 hours, respectively. In the latter case, students intend to use this
topic as a basis for their master's theses during succeeding term. '

 

It is apparent ﬁrm the above course description that an attempt was
made to cover both scientific coaputing and electronic data. processing in the
subject. This can indeed be done, particularly when individual tern papers
are assigned. However, as tine goes on it may be advisable to separate this

subject into two distinct subjects, one dealing solely with scientific computing
and the other with business data processing.

This subject was taught by Dr. F. El. Vcrzuh, Director, office of
Statistical Services. There were 26 students enrolled in Subject 6.538 during
the Spring Term 1956 of which there W316 12 Electrical Engineering students,
4 Chemical Engineering students, one Geophysics student , 3 Economics students,
2 Business Administration students, and 4 Hatheraatics students, respectively.
This was the first time students were able to use the 650 Calculator as part of
their laboratory work. Judging by the large number of this group - 12 students --
who are now using the machine for the solution of their thesis problems, it
appears that the subject was highly successful.
