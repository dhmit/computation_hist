upper memory in a manner similar to that achieved by the

common counter, which is initially set to 77461,(32561, ),

 

phase error results. A phase relocation error is also
possible; the rules for avoiding this error are the same

as for the BSS pseudo-operation.

The COMMON pseudo-operation is used to reserve blocks of

use of DIMENSION and COMMON statements in FORTRAN programs.
The assembler maintains a special counter, called the

10
which is the last cell of upper memory available to FORTRAN
programs during execution. A COMMON pseudo-operation as-
signs the current value of the common counter to the symbol
in the location field and then decreases the common counter
by the value of the expression in the variable field. A
symbol defined by a COMVION pseudo-operation is a common
symbol. Note that the symbol in the location field is
assigned to the last cell of the block reserved (not the
cell after the last cell of the block as with the BES).
This usage coincides with the FORTRAN rule that the name
of an array refers to the logically-first cell of the
array, which is stored last in memory. All symbols used
in the variable field of a COMMON pseudo-operation must
have been previously defined, or a phase error results.
A phase relocation error is also possible; the rules for
avoiding this error are the same as for the BSS pseudo-

operation.

Data Generation

Tho assembler provides five pscudo-opzrations (OCT, DEC,
BCI, BCD, and VFD) which may be used to introduce words

of data into the program at assembly time. Numbers
introduced in this way are often referred to as ''constants."
The OCT pseudo-operation says to the assembler, ''take the
octal integers which are specified, one per subfield from

left to right, in the variable field, convert these integers
