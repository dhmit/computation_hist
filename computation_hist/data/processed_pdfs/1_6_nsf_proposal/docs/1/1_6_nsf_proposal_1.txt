Dear Leon:

I will €ry to call you when I am in Washington this
Wednesday and Thursday, but if I do not reach you, I will try to
answer your query of March 27.

Joe Weyl tells me that his division may not have funds
to carry the ONR part of the program next year, so I can't tell

“you how the budget is to be divided. At present all I can say is

that anything you can contribute between $30,000, representing
half the first year's budget as given in the application, and the
full 60,000, would be welcomed. If we can't get the rest from
ONR, we will have to charge some of the other projects here for
programming services, though I don't like to do so.

For half the budget we would split the budget length-
wise, as follows:

Principal Investigator (8 per cent of

12,500 g 1,000

Other Faculty Member (1/4 of Z8,000) 2,000
2 Senior Investigators 13,000
1 Junior Investigator 6,000
1 Secretary 5,000
$25, 000

Overhead (see note) 10,000
$35,000

1/2 of other items 5,000
40, 000

Since the first year will involve a linear build-up over the
first half of the year (see earlier discussion ), the budget for
the first year will be g30,000.
