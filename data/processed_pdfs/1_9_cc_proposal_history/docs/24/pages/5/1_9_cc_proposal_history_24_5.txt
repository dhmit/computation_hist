Machine Computation Instructor in charge: R.E. Scott
hours: 3-0-6 (=3 units) Prerequisite: M22-Diff. Equations

Study of analog computation with emphasis on the management of
variables and on the analysis of computing elements and systems. A
detailed study of the logical use of the differential analyzer in the
treatment of ordinary differential equations forms a basis for further
study of the application of analog computing elements in the solution
of a variety of mathematical problems (algebraic and integral equations,
Fourier transforms, etc.). Introductory study of the accuracy of
machine elements. Consideration of the computing viewpoint in analogs,
simulators, signal filtering, automatic control. Some economic and
operational aspects of the use of machines. Project and optional
problems assigned to encourage a variety of interests.

Study of the basic principles of digital computers by experiments
on the following components: synchroscopes and pulse-viewing equip-
ment, pulse generators, bistable circuits, binary counters, coincidence
circuits, variable delay circuits, frequency dividers, electronic dis=-
tributors, matrix switches, and magnetic recording equipment. The
actual programming and operation of a digital computer as revealed by
the solution of several computational problems on the Model 600 ;
punched=card calculators. Principles of electronic analogue computers
treated by a study of electronic integrators, electronic different-
jators, data conversion equipment, data recording equipment, and
associated equipment. Work on the analogue equipment handled in pro-
ject assignments.

Pulsed-Data Systems Instructor in charge: W.K. Linvill
hours: 3-0-6 (=3 units) Prerequisite: 6.56-Math. Methods in
' E.E.; or 6.581-Transients in
Linear Systems

Study of the processes of sampling of continuous data and of
smoothing of sampled data. Analysis and design of linear systems em-
ploying pulsed data. Investigation of feedback systems employing
sampled error data including stability studies of such systems. Tran-
sient response of sampled-error data servomechanisms. Study of con-
tinuous systems by numerical methods. Study of digital computer oper-
ations as data filtering, analysis and synthesis of linear digital
computer programs in the frequency domain. Comparison between tech-
niques of numerical analysis and control system design. Design of
systems involving digital computers as components. Comparisons be-
tween analog and digital computers. Study of optimum linear system
design as applied to discrete systems. Comparison of classical "least
squares" curve fitting with optimum system design. Survey of methods
