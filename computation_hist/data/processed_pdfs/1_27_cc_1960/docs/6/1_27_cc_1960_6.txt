Subject: Replacement of 704 by a 7090.

Beckﬁroung - In June, 1957, somewhat less than three years
ago, ay7oe was installed at the Computation Center by IBM, under
a special agreement whereby IBU maintains the equipment, contri-
butes toward amortizing the additions to the Compton Laboratory

each term and summer. A number of other collagen bring some of
their classes in for one or more liberatory sessions. Class use
will expand further, but it s expansion will be harpered by the
limitations of access to the 704, as will be discussed later.

Whirlwind days, is well known.

Tineushering Eechniggeg: Ve already have a typewriter connected
to the 704, which works on a timewsharing basis with onr regular
operator routine, so new programs can be debugged at the same time
that regular conputations are being carried out on other problems,

,.1

for example. ﬁne 704 cannot cvf9§_ively acconode ﬁmore then one
or two such sa telite channels, but the Center staff is now at work

on the desivn and programming required to provide a 7090 with $10

the erperinent or the scientist can go on to the next step and
request the n xt computation in turn. On the 704 this wouldv
require the exclusive use of the machine, though only a fraction
of the 704 speed would be used; obviously again, time—sharing
techniques are needed.

These, and many other programs now in progress, such as
the character—recognition studies '. i _ “. , the research
on economic forecasting and on operational behavior using large-
scale simulation techniques, should be of particular interest to
IBM, for they have direct bearing on the proD wress of computer
design and utilization. They represent the sortie; cooperative
research between experts in different fields which MIT does so
effectively, and they involve the combination of research and
education for which MIT is preueninent. This work deserves
support by IBM, in addition to the educational activities which
are already bein5 su.ppv3r£§dh3y the present contribution of the 704.
They can most effective] 1y£§y the installation of a 7090, replacim
the 704, in the near future; MIT will then be able to provide
the siiﬁeanid ancillary equipment to push ahead with dispatcho
Because of the "inter—connectedness" of much of this research,
it can best be carriedo 5(perhaps j.t can only be carried out)
in the atmosphere of mutual cooperation and -xchange of infor«
