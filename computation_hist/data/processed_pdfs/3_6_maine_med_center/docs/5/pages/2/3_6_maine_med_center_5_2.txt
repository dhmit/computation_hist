the magnitudes the wall potentials, measured with re-
spect to a Wilson central terminal, over most of the
right side of the tank, to decrease them near the center
and part of the left wall, and to increase them again
over much of the left side. The locations of the null
points are also changed. The table shows that all. limb
leads are increased with the exception of VL, which is
reduced in magnitude Since ,8 (see ref. 5) is only
—10°, 0: and a, are very nearly equal. a, is changed
from ~24° to ~51° by the low-resistance ﬂuid.

Table 1, for the same experiment as ﬁgure 1, shows
the effect on the limb leads of the low—reSistance ﬂuid,
when a transmural dipole was used. One of the diﬂi—
culties encountered in these tests was the gradual low-
ering of the heart tissue resistance itself With time after
death. However, the data of column 2 were taken ﬁrst,
followed by column 1 and then 3, so that the error from

this cause would tend to make the differences between
the potentials with the two ﬂuids smaller rather than
larger. In order to standardize the records, they were
scaled down to correspond to a dipole excitation strength
of 1 ina-cm. The low resistance ﬂuid causes an apparent
change in the angle a of 35".

With a tangential dipole, there is a uniform lowering
of ﬁeld potentials with the ow resistance ﬂuid, but for
other angles, the potentials are increased in some areas
and decreased in others. Tiese results can be readily

visualized by means of the method of images, eg, for 21

radial dipole, the image dipo e inside the highly conduct-
ing sphere will be pointed in the same direction as the
external, real dipole, The image dipole will therefore
reinforce the real dipole at most points, but in a region
between the two dipoles, the image will counteract the
real dipole.

These effects were shown more strikingly in the ex—
periments with a metal sphere in the tank. Although
the resistance of metal is very much lower than that of
electrolytes, it can be shown theoretically that the effect
of the metal sphere on ﬁeld potentials should not differ
too greatly from that due to a sphere having a resistivity

 

one-tenth that of the surrounding ﬂuid. Figures 3, 4,
and 5 show the horizontal wall distributions for dipoles
at angles of 0° (tangential), 45° and 90° (radial) to
tie surface of the metal sphere Curves E, O, and J,
with the sphere out of the tank or at an inﬁnite distance
from the dipole, correspond to a homogeneous medium.
In each case, the dipole was kept ﬁxed in position. and
tie sphere was moved away from the dipole. The effect
of the sphere becomes greater as it approaches the dipole.

In view of these results, we conclude that the presence
of the relatively highly conducting blood inside the heart
crambers may have a signiﬁcant effect on the valves of
the recorded potentials. We also postulate that the fact
iat subepicardial potentials are recorded with much
maller amplitudes than epicardial potentials may he
xplained by (at) their greater distance from the record»
ing electrode, and (b) by the greater shunting effect of
tie cavity blood on these components. This would cer—
tainly be true for any tangential spread of excitation on
tie endoeardial surface, but for a purely radial dipole,
the potentials should be increased.
