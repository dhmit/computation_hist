Reference: Contract N5ori-06001 DIC-#6345, #6915

ltems as the preparation of summary reports on the program of
Machine Methods of Computation,

This summary 1s baged on estimates prepared by Prof-
éssor P, M. Morse,

Professor Morse further advigeg that the expected
arrival of an IBM Type 704 Electronic Dota Processing Machine ag
MIT about January 1, 1957 will create a definite need for addai-
tional funds--to finance the conversion of existing Whirlwing
Programs to Type 704 programs,

Under the proposed plen submitted herewith, Project
#6345 (Whirlwing Operation) woulad terminate on June 30, 1957,
The task order rfor thig period would include the usual Whirlwind
Project activitiss:

1. Research in methods of numerieal analysis and
the formulation of sclientific problems for machine
solution, together with the training of Personnel
in thesge methods,

2. Support of the Sclentific and Engineering Applica-
tione Group of ProjJect Whirlwind so a8 to meke the
computer useful and avallable for the above-mentioned
research,

In addition, 1t ig proposed that the following task
order arlsing in connection with the Type 704 EDPM be included:

3. The develovment of & sultable interpretive program
and associated coding technlques %o permlt effective
implementation of the Type 704 machine.

It is anticipated that a separate project will be get
up to handle the Type 704 utilization within the MIT Computation
Center, and a 8eparate request to the ONR for support of this work
wlll be msde in the near future., In this r'espeet certain
éxperlenced programmers could be made avgilable for transfer to
this new tagk ag of January 1, 1957 This enticipated tranafer
has been taken into account in the budget proposed for Project #6345,

The foregoing proposal doss not take into consideration
termination costs which may be agssoclated with the close out of
this contract ang the possible dispoeltion of the Whirlwingd Computer,
It is proposed %o delay the submittal o eny budget for thig matter
untll such tims as disposition of the Whirlwing Computer ig
determined,
