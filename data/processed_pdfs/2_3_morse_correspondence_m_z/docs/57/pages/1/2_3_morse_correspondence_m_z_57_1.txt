Dear Mr. Baker:

Tuesday, January 8, seems to be a bad day. However,
Dr. Brown is free at 10:30 on Thursday, January 10 snd Professor
liorse is available at 3:30 the same day. Will this be convenient
for you?

It looks like we can get computer time for Jim on
Wednesday, January 9 at 3:30 A.M, and Thursday, January 10 at
4 P.M, in two two-~hour periods,

Professor lMorse has suggested that the grant be left
with the Electrical Engineering Department, but that the work
be integrated with the operations research program and the ®mne
putation @nter,

Sincerely yours,

Dean N, Arden
