Dear Phil:
I expect to be in Cambridge the morning of
19 February on my way to Lexington that afternoon. Would
it be possible for me to visit your computer facility? I
should like to also have the opportunity of chatting with
you about the idea of the support of such installation.
If agreeable, will you please set a time and

place for our meeting.

Cordially,

i
