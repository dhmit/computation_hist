THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION

Policy with Respect to Announcement of Grants

The Rockefeller Foundation records its grants in an Annual
Report, and in Rockefeller Foundation Grants, issued quarterly, in
which brief reports of grants are published soon after they have
been made.

The Foundation is always glad to have its reports supplemented
through announcements issued locally by recipients at the time the
award is made. Only if the announcement involves an interpretation
of the Foundationâ€™s purpose in making the grant, do the officers of
the Foundation request that they be given the opportunity of seeing
the statement before it is released.

Acknowledgment of Foundation aid in the support of research
may also be made when the research results are published.

The Foundation requests, however, that in making public refer-
ences to grants, recipients avoid any implication that the Foundation
has any control over the project or any responsibility for its results.

The name of the Foundation should not be used in advertising,
especially of books, nor in designating projects, fellowships, labora-
tories, or buildings toward which it has contributed.
