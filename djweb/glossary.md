### Glossary

Musings for whoever is working on this over IAP

##### Misc. thoughts

* Functionality to sort alphabetically and by category would be good
* Default sorting: alphabetically? That is standard for glossaries
* Should glossary entries link to documents where the term is used? At that point, it functions 
more like an index. I think that would be a nice additional feature to have, but is 1) not a 
priority and 2) would be bad if there are just two many references to comprehend
* Do we only want glossary entries for things in the archival documents, or also terms in the 
general descriptive history sections? This probably depends on how the site evolves, how 
historical context is integrated into the presentation, and what level of explanation is included
 in those contextualizing writings.

##### Types of terms to include

###### ACRONYMS

These are perhaps the most important. No one will know what they mean.

We probably don't need to 
define "MIT."

* NSF = National Science Foundation
* ONR = Office of Naval Research
* IBM = International Business Machines
* USSR, USA
* SAO = Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory
* NERCC = New England Regional Computing Center
* SAP = Symbolic Assembly Programmer

###### Agencies, companies, countries, etc.

* Office of Statistical Services
* Operation Moonwatch

Most of these are ancronym-ized; see above.

###### Technical terms

E.g. programming languages, types of computers
* IBM 704
* Sputnik
* FORTRAN
* LISP
* Floating-point arithmetic
* Punch card


###### People?

This info might be represented elsewhere - but maybe it would still be useful to have entries in 
the glossary that link to those representations since the glossary is where people go. But maybe 
there will just be way too many people and we shouldn't include them.

###### Types of documents

* Contracts
* Proposals
* Invoices

There will presumably some other repository for information about the evolving bureacratic 
structure of computing at MIT, so how much of that info should go in these entries? Maybe these 
shouldn't be glossary entries.

###### Anything lab members come across that they don't know

How do we get people to keep track of this? The reality is that no one adds to markdown files and
 does pull requests. Google Doc for terms?
