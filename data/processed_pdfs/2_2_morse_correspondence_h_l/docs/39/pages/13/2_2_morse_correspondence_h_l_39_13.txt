Thermal Conductivity: VI, Determination of Conductivity
of Al,O, by Spherical Envelope and
Cylinder Methods

by W. D. KINGERY

Values of the thermal conductivity of Al,O; have
been determined by methods employing a spheri-
cal envelope specimen completely surrounding a
heat source and a long hollow cylinder in which
a center section is employed for a test zone.
Values obtained are in close agreement with
values previously determined by other methods.

I. Introduction

PPLICATION of thermal conductivity data has been hin-
A dered in the past by a decided lack of confidence in the
published values. This has been due mainly to large
discrepancies between values reported by variousinvestigators
for the same materials (see footnote 1 below and Part I, this
series). These variations are probably due to experimental
techniques which must be carefully controlled to obtain satis-
factory results.? Previously in this series it has been reported
that thermal conductivity values for pure aluminum oxide,
magnesium oxide, and beryllium oxide measured by two dif-
ferent methods have been in good agreement (Parts IIT and
IV). The present study is a further attempt to check these
methods by independent means and to demonstrate that in-
dependent methods of measurement give equivalent results
for the same material. Aluminum oxide was selected as a test
material.

The first method chosen for investigation was a spherical
envelope method. If a hollow sphere surrounds a uniform-
temperature heat source and the temperature is measured at
two different radii of the sphere, thermal conductivity can be
calculated from the expression

This general method has previously been emploved by Euc-
ken and Laube.® The method is theoretically simple and
sound; the only disadvantages are experimental.

The second method employed in this investigation was the
use of a center portion of a long hollow cylinder. In this
case, thermal conductivity is given by the expression

This method has been long used for pipe covering,* and 1s
theoretically simple and satisfactory under certain conditions.
Sample fabrication is a difficulty.

These two methods of measurement are completely inde-
pendent of each other as are the previous methods employed
in this laboratory. It was the feeling of the present investi-
gators that agreement of values obtained by these methods
would unequivocably demonstrate that various methods of
measurement can be used with good results if careful tech-
nique is employed. Conversely, disagreement of results
would have necessitated a careful review of the principles and
techniques previously and presently employed.

Il. Methods and Results

The method of employing spherical envelope specimens 1S
simple in concept and theory. The major experimental diffi-
culties are obtaining a uniformly heated spherical heat source,

fabricating spherical samples, and locating thermocouples
along the spherical isotherms. After some experimentation
all these requirements were met satisfactorily.

The heater consisted of 0.016-in. platinum wire wound on a
spherical core of dense Al,0;. The Al.O3 sphere was approxi-
mately 1.5 in. in diameter. It was prepared by slip casfmg
and prefired to 1100°C. to give it sufficient strength for final
shaping. To maintain temperature uniformity over the sur-
face of the sphere, the heat generated per unit area must b.e
constant. It can be easily shown that windings must be uni-
fomll)" spread on the circumference (not on the diam’ctcr.) to
meet this condition. Grooves meeting these S])CCiflCéltl(.)IlS
were cut in the prefired sphere by hand and it was then high
fired. The platinum resistance winding was installed and
Covered with a uniform layer of Alundum cement. TR

Hemispherical samples were prepared by slip casting i
blaster molds. The sample dimensions were 1.75 1. inside
diameter and 3.5 in. outside diameter. Circular thermocou-
ble holes were cast in place near the inner and outer surface
(along the isotherms). These were formed by coating heavy
cotton thread with molten paraffin and forming to shape.

The solidified paraffin coating maintained its shape during
casting and burned out on firing without rupturing the speci-
men. Location of thermocouples along the isotherms pre-
vents any distortion of heat flow by the thermocouples and
insures that temperature measurements are not erroneous
owing to temperature gradients in the thermocouples.

The plane surfaces of two hemispherical halves were lapped,
and assembled around the heating core. Samples were radio-
graphed to locate the thermocouple positions accurately.
Heat input was measured with a wattmeter; temperatures
were measured with Pt-Pt-109, Rh thermocouples. The
assembly was covered with a 2-in. layer of insulating firebrick,
Babcock and Wilcox K-28, to increase the mean temperature
of the specimen. Thermal conductivity was calculated by
equations (1) and (2). The test specimen and assembly are
shown in Figs. 1 to 3.

The method of employing a hollow-cylinder tester is simi-
larly simple in concept and theory, but involves some difficul-
ties experimentally. To insure cylindrical isotherms at the
center of a finite cvlinder, it has been shown that the length-
diameter ratio must be greater than four.® To achieve at
least this ratio, and at the same time allow for a heating zone
long enough for precise measurements and a cvlinder diameter
large enough for precise measurements, the sample size be-
comes considerable and makes fabrication difficult. Asin the
case of the sphere, thermocouple holes must be along isotherms
(parallel to the axis) to prevent heat loss and to allow precise
measurements.

The sample shape chosen is shown in Figs. 4 to 6. The
heater was formed by uniformly spacing 0.016-in. platinum
windings along a two-hole Alundum thermocouple tube 3/ in.
in outside diameter. Voltage leads to a wattmeter were
brought in by separate holes through saw cuts in the tube and
welded to the heater, forming a test zone about 4 . long.
After forming, the heater was uniformly coated with a layer of
Alundum cement to hold it in place.

The Al,O; sample was prepared by slip casting (inside diam-
eter, about 0.6 in.; outside diameter, about 1.5 in.).
Thermocouple holes were cast in place by suspending heavy
cotton threads along the axis near the inner and outer sur-
faces. The entire sample length was about 18 in. and the test
sone was 4 in., leaving 7 in. on either side to insure cylindrical
isotherms over the test zone. This is considerably longer
than the minimum requirements.
