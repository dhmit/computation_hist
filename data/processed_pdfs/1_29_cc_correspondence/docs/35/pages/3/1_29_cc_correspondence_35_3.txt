tape input and the inter-job time 1s reduced
to some slight tape manipulation by the
Monitor.

Manuals on FMS and FAP will be made available soon at the Center.
Because of the attractliveness of the above Fortran-FAP

ronitor system and the effectiveness of the Fortran compiler

it 1s expected that a major portion of the users of the Center

will prefer to use the system for any new work. The Center

staff will recommend this system to all new programmers who

seek advice. This willl be the case for those irom

the New England colleges when distance and debugging inconven-

ience are a burden. It 1s expected that considerable machine

time will be saved if it 1s possible to use FMS as the principal

operating system of the Center.

 

The above recommendation of the Center, however, should
not be viewed as excluding otfher operating procedures with
the computer. 1In particular there are two principal reasons
for deviation:

1. ease of transition from the 704 to the
709, and

2. 1inadequacies or weaknesses (from the user's
point-of-view) in the Fortran-FAP Monitor
System.

B. SO0S System
As is fairly well known, the original discussion of
the 709 computer stimulated various persons in SHARE to
develop an entirely new programming system. This system was

to be reasonably compatible with SAP on the 704, be a monitor
