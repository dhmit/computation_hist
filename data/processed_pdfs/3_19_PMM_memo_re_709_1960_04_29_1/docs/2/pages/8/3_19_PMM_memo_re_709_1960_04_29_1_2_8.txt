2) A set of consoles that are equipped in addition with both
a visual display device and a means of communicating hand
drawn shapes. Neither of these devices exists in a suitable
form at present for this usage. Display devices such as
OScilloscopes have of course been used with computers for
Some time, but most of these require an inordinate amount of
machine time to develop and maintaln a display. Similarly,
devices such as "light pens" for entering information suffer
from the same defects of machine time requirements as the pre-
sent oscilloscopes. A good, low input data rate, self-main-
taining display will have to be developed, as well as a form
of ‚Äùdrawing pad" for entering information. Much larger ver-
sions of these same devices will then be used to equip one or
two lecture halls which will be tied into the system. This
by no means exhausts the possibilities, Having provided for
remote input-output Stations, many experiments such as cross
connecting with a smaller computer, testing out "spoken" in-
put languages, etec. become feasible.

ocheduling

A computer system is basically a job shop whose business
is computation. It has many different processing equipments
within it, such as its high speed memory, disc files, arith-
metlc units, etc. Not all of these are needed at any one time,
for any one problem. To maximize its output, i.e. to do as
much information processlng as possible, the computer must
schedule "how much of what problem it does when". That 1s, the
computer must be able to rapidly solve its own " Job Shop
Scheduling Problem" in order to efficiently overlap many di-
verse jobs. This problem has yet to be adequately solved.

Programming

Each of the aspects already mentioned will have an effect
on the final set of programming systems and programming
