Dear Truman:

1 have completed the ﬂoor layout plans of the BA! room
in the basement 0: Bldg. 26 and now realize that we probably do not
have an adequate number of vodﬁ‘iers in our plans for the Computation
Center. You will recall that the original decision regarding In
complement was made by Messrs. Kurd and ﬂueon prior to your appoint-
ment as educational representative, and at that time we had: one key
punch and one verifier in the installation. During the summer you

and I discussed the key punching requirements and increased the
number to the present total of six.

At the present time in our operation of Whirlwind, we have
the following equipment:

(ii-on! Rguigment
Protessional Group 3 Flexowriten
3 Verifier-s
1 Comparator
Self~8erviee Unit 3 Tape Pederntors
3 Verifiors

1 Comparator

If we were to attempt to extrapolate from the Whirlwind operation, it
would appear that we need more verifiers. In View of the delivery of
veritiera, I would like to suggest that we place an order for two (2)
