COMPARISON OF METHODS OF FORECASTING CUSTOMER-DEMANDS FOR
PRODUCTS.

The time allotted to this problem is 8.00 hours. (For the period ending Sept. 30, 1961)

Dear sir:

Above is the allocation of 709 computer time for your
problem for the period July 1, 1961 through September 30, 1961.
During the last quarter the Center has made some variations in
the scheduling and operating procedures to improve the
utilization of the 709. Although the present demand for
computer time is not as great as in the last two quarters,
it still exceeds the amount of time available and it has
been necessary to scale down most requests. This allotment
is based on the expectation that you will schedule your
usage over the period; unless you do work-load peaks may
make it impossible to realize your allotment,

Sincerely,

Lu
