The shared [People Involved google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dSQGM0ukTw4IS36IARtzUkGArRlSYjTmlAXkJzkBDqQ/edit?usp=sharing)
holds all the people the Archive group has done research on, and is a good starting point to find
 people to research.
 
 Fernando J Corbato, a primary figure in the Computation Center, is still alive and lives at 4 
 Melody Ln, Newbury, MA 01951-1317. He has not been contacted yet.
## Managing Editor
Members of the Archive group will put completed biographies in Google Doc form in the Completed 
Writing folder of the Google Drive. The Managing Editor will edit these biographies, convert them
 to markdown form, and add them to the appropriate markdown file in the History Group folder
(either Principal Biographies or Hidden Figures).
