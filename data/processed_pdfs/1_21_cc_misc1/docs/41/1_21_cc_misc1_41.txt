hear Frank:

Thanks for your Aenordndun. of Yohriary aren regarding

2 he outlines of subjects around the area of machine computa-
at ‘tion, i would like to make the following comments.

mg. — a

First: The only difference that I note between the out-

Lo for the Senior Elective and for the Graduate Subject

6.538, is that 6.538 looks to be somewhat more of the same.
Both statements resemble the one dn the current Satalogue for

Bulject 6,538,

Second: Towss the desire ef le Hoe Comnlting 10
offer as an undergraduate elective substantially what you
now offer as Subject 6.538; i believe we should do this.

After a subject has been operated: at the graduate level
in an emerging field for a number of years, it is inevitable
that the undergraduate demand for it becomes substantial,
Either it should be replaced by something vastly more intel-

lectual at the frontiers of the field, or it should be offered

as a Senior Elective. The present widespread undergraduate

‘student demand for information of the kind that you so  gonpe-~ =

tently give is proof of this situation.

I am not happy with the substance of your proposed gradu-
ate subject. Furthermore, I doubt the wisdom of your making
a commitment to teach an undergraduate and a graduate subject
at this time when the demand is so great that what you now of-
fer is in demand for both terms.

I propose, therefore, to use one or the other of the ver-
sions that you have given me at this time only as a Senior
Elective, 6.258. You may tell me which version you prefer and
what to call it.

Sincerely yours,

rdon S. Brown
