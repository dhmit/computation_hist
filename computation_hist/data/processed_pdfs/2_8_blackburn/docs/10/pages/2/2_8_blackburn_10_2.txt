Titles of papers vary from specific programming and coding
problems to numerical analysis. In other words, anything you wish to pre-
sent will be of interest to the group.

Attendance is limited to seventy. Housing and meals will be
supplied by IBM at Homestead.

Initially mimeographed copies of all papers will be distributed
to all those in attendance. A little later it is expected that a bound volume
(either cloth or paper) will be published and be made available for general
distribution to IBM and to customers.

We would be particularly pleased to have MIT participate by
presenting one or perhaps two papers. Please let me know as soon as possi=-
ble to what extent you will participate. | need to send the names and titles
to Mr. Lawrence right away. Mr. Lawrence would like to receive copies
of manuscripts directly from authors by July 15.

Sincerely,

. F. Blackbumn
