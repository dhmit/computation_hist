TO: Dr. F. J. Corbato
M.I.T.

Your letter of February 2 indicates a change in the total for the
IBM Research Assistants to M.I.T. for the school year 1959-60.
Although M.I.T. has already received the $14, 497. 50 second
semester payment from IBM based on the old total, I suggest
any adjustment await a few more weeks for other possible
changes.

According to my records, the new total of $28, 030. 00 for the
school year 195960 ie divided as follows: the amount of

$14, 545.00 has been paid out by M.1. T. for first semester
commitments; $13, 485. 00 has been committed so far for the
second semester. Since IBM paid $14, 857.50 for the first
semester, there should be a balance of $312.50 still available
for second semester use. In addition $15, 000. 00 minus

$13, 485, 00 gives $1, 515. 00 which would also be allowable for
second semester appointments. This gives a total of $1, 827.50
still available for assignment in the secord semester.
