PROPOSAL FOR RESEARCH INTO THE EFFECTS
OF AUTOMATIC CONTROL AND MACHINE PROCESSING OF OPERATING DATA ON
SOCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL OPERATIONS

We propose to study the effects of automatic control
techniques and computing devices on social and industrial opera-
tiong,by closely coordinated research in three ma jor directions:

1. Case studies of the possibilities and consequences
of "automation‚Äù in several carefully chosen industrial and govern-
mental operations. Each case would be studied by a mixed team, drawn *
from a variety of disciplines. The operations studied would be
actual ones, a factory or a store or a part of a government service,
so specific operating data will be obtainable and so' that the prac-
tical difficulties will be apparent; general principles can be
built up inductively from the results of several such studies.
These' studies would have to be carried out with the close coopera-
tion of the administrators of the operations studied. ,

2. Research into the techniques of automatic control and
into the use of machine processed data, and experiments with the
use of various input and output equipment. This research can be
carried on in cooperation with the Institute's new Computation
Center and would utilize the interest and kriowledge of those members
of the Institute staff who are already doing research in this area.
The results of this broader research activity would provide new
suggestions for application in the case studies of (1) and the
problems arising from the case studies would suggest new techniques
and equipment to investigate.

5. Quantitative analysis of the dynamics of social and
industrial operations by the techniques of operations research.
This research would develop the mathematical theory which would be
utilized in the specific applications studied in parts (1) and (2).
Regularities in the operating data obtained from the case histories
could be used to extend the theory and extensions of the theory
could help guide the case studies and the equipment development.

Close cooperation would be insured between the three
parts of the project by frequent conferences and by occasional
transfer of staff from one part to another. Each part would be
staffed by a few full-time staff members, by 2 number of interested =2
members of the Institute faculty, each contributing a portion of
his time, and by half-time research assistants chosen from the
graduate students of all departments. Each of the three types of
" staff members will be necessary: the full-time research associates
to carry on the administrative details of the project and to main-
tain continuity of effort; the faculty members to contribute their
varied background of knowledge and to transmit the knowledge gained
