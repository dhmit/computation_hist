Minutes of M.I.T. M,C.C., -

There was considerable discussion of the merits of the
various new applicants. In particular, Forrester and Caldwell
voiced the opinion that machine computation experience should
almost disqualify an applicant since it was felt that a well-
trained person should obtain support elsewhere.

After taking a vote on the various candidates by committee
members present, it was finally decided that Jones, Sax, Dupree
and Mullin would be recommended. No alternate was suggested,
but possibly Carroll would be considered if it were appropriate.
The final solution of the recommendations was left to the
discretion of Morse.

As a final note, Forrester suggested that the application
forms that were used this year were too scanty and, in particular,
suggested more than just one letter of recommendation and preferably
information on grades and academic background be required. It was
suggested that in the future this information could be borrowed
from the various departments! graduate student files for the pur-
pose of this selectlon meeting.

The meeting closed at about 4:00 p.m.
