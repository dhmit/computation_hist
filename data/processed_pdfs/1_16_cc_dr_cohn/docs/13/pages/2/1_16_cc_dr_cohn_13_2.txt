STABLE LATTICES

HARVEY COHN

1. Introduction. The . consideration of relative extrema to correspond
to the absolute extremum which is the critical lattice has been going on for gome
time. As far back as 1873, Korkine and Zolotareff [6] worked with the ellipsoid
in hyperspace (i.e., with quadratic forms), and later Minkowski [8] worked
with a general convex body in two or three dimensions. They showed how to find
critical lattices by selection from among a finite number of relative extrema.
They were aided by the long-recognized premise that only a finite number of
lattice points can enter into consideration [1] when one deals with 1
“admissible to convex bodies.”

In the realm of the more general star body, such as that involved in the
product of homogeneous forms, there is no finiteness principle of equal scope.
Mahler [7] has, however, developed- a local property for the critical lattices
established by Davenport [3; 4], by using “bounded reducibility.”

We shall develop a similar property which we shall call stability and we shall
extend it to a large class of lattices for star bodies. We shall do this by introducing
a formalism of positively dependent differentials. Then as an illustration, we shall
give a condition for stability of the norm in an algebraic module (a condition
which can be considerably simplified by the use of units in the Dedekind order [5]).

2. Critical lattices. A lattice ¥, in n-space, is determined by a n X n
matrix (@) of (say) positive determinant | a,-jH, the points of the lattice being
denoted by the vectors X with components

n
(2.1) X¢= D, Gy m,y
j=1

corresponding to the integral n-tuple (m,) = (my, . .., m,). A real continuously
differentiable function, ¢(x), homogeneous of positive degree % in its variables,
is defined in the space. The locus |¢| = 1 is the boundary of the star body
under consideration. Then we consider the function defined by

(2.2) F(m,R) = ¢(x)/|layl e,

For each lattice €, an infimum of | F| is defined over (m), excluding the origil} of
course, Call it M (R). Let the values M (¥) have a finite supremum MO.’Now‘nf a
lattice {, exists for which M ({,) = M, then &, is called a critical lattice. 1 hus
