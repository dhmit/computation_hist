DRAFT OF LETTER TO ONR
to accompany proposal

Gentlemen:

I am enclosing a memorandum from Prof. Philip M. Morse
covering part of the work of our M.I.T. Center for Machine Compu-
fation, which has recently been inaugurated to combine and coordi-
nate the use of existing computing machines at the Institute, in-
cluding those owned by the Institute and those provided by the
Government. The digital computer in Project Whirlwind is, of
course, an important part of the equipment here.

Prof. Morse has been appolnted the head of this Center,
and the work to be done will, therefore, be under his supervisioh.

It is very pleasant to be able To state that most of the
arduous end sometimes discouraging work required to construct Whirl-
wind is neering 1ts end, and we are definltely arriving at a point
where ONR's support of Project Whirlwind wlll show itself in results.
IT is the definite eim of the Center to promote and develop the use
of Whirlwind for research and training to the maximum whidh the
present situation permits.

Very Truly yours,
