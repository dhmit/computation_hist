Dear Mr. Krumhansel:

I am sorry but I "111 be unable to attend the 1958
Gordon Research Conference to which you invited me in your
letter of May 6.

I appreciate the opportunity which was offered and
hope to participate in a similar conference 1n the future.
Unfortunately, other matters prevent m9 from attending the
conference.

Sincerely,

F. J. Corbaté
