MAKING ELECTRONS COUNT

The M.I.T. Digital Computer Laboratory, which operates in part under
the sponsorship of the Office of Naval Research, has recently completed a 23-
minute, single-reel, 16 mm amateur motion picture in color with narration and
background music recorded on a standard optical sound track, under the direc-
tion of Edwin S, Kopley and Lloyd C. Sanford.

This film, entitled MAKING ELECTRONS COUNT, shows a little of the
location and work of the laboratory, pictures a number of different kinds of
applications of digital computers, and then tells the story of a typical user
learning to use M.I.T.'s Whirlwind I computer to solve his problem. The his-
tory of computers and the various component parts of Whirlwind I also are
shown briefly. The film has little or no technical detail and emphasizes the
use, rather than the construction, of computers. It attempts to describe the
use of a computer honestly, without underplaying the unpleasant details, but
in a fairly light-hearted vein.

Any organization wishing to borrow this film should complete the
following application.
