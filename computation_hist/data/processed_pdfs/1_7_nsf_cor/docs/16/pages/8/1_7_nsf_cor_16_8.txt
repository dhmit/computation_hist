Since the staff will be acquired in 1956, some of them
being transferred from other projects between July and December

1356, expenditures for the first year 1956—1957 will be about
3 4 of the above yearly estimate. $60,000.

One half or this contributed by NSF $30,000
Requested for year beginning July 1, 1956.

Note 22 Overhead: The suggested overhead is larger than most NSF
grants. In the present case, however, the research is intimately
dependent on the functioning of a large computing center, most of

the support of which will be borne by other sources. It is necessary
and appropriate that NSF contribute, to some extent to the operation
of the Center, the services of which this Project will use continually.
There is no simple procedure for itémizing this-cost as a direct
charge, so it is included as an increase in the usual overhead.
