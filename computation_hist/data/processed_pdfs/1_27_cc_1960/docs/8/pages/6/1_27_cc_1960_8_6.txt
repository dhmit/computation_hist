with a very large dictionary would, in addition, tax the
TO4's capabilities. Dr. ¥Yngve has not as yet been hampered
serlously other than in the sense of slow programming pro-

Symbolic Manipulation (Artificial Intelligengce Project-Dr's
M. Minsky and J. MeCarthy
Dr's Minsky and MeCarthy have developed a language for

dealing with logical and game type problems which as of yet
are primarily symbolic (as opposed to numerie) in character.
They are now engaged in applying this language to a large
¢lass of problem solving situations, reanging from chess to
the proof of theorums. One characteristic of such problems
1s that they tend to require an exhaustive search through a
large number of possibilities.

The main hope in such problems is that the machine c¢an
elther by ltself or with on-line human assistance develop a
rule of thumb (or heuristic) to short cut the exhaustive
search and trial procedure. Thils class of problems requires
very fast informatlon processing, combined with as large a
random access memory as 1s possible to apply their tech-
niques €0 any sizeable problem clearly can require up to
weeks of TO4 time.

Experlmental Physics Data Reduction-Dr. D. Caldwell

Dire Caldwell's work on determining the characteristics
of hyperons (Lambda, D, Pi, Mu, ete.) involves the detection
and computatlion of certain types of trajectories from among
10-100,000 photographs of high bubble chamber tracks.

This problem not only involves a large amount of data,
but has strong requlrements for the machine to recognize
characteristic patterns. This type of process (although once
the pattern is recognized the computation is small) ean again
severely tax the 704 facilities.
