NOTE ON FIELDS OF SMALL DISCRIMINANT

HARVEY COHN!

The problem of finding totally real fields of any degree and small
discriminant is of interest, aside from intrinsic reasons, because of its
connection with critical lattices for the product of the coordinates.
The ground-work, however, seems to be largely unexplored. This is
probably illustrated by a somewhat persistent conjecture [4]* that
for totally real fields of degree (g—1)/2, where g is a prime >3, the
smallest discriminant is g@=>!2, achieved for R (cos 2m/g), where R is
the field of rational numbers. (This is the maximal real sub-field in
the field of the gth roots of unity.) This conjecture was often made im-
plicitly even before its verification [1] by Davenport for g=7 (the
case g=35 having been trivial). We disprove this for those g, such as
13, 37, etc., for which (g+1)/2 is also prime. We use relative quadratic
fields built on base fields of small discriminant, a device used previ-
ously by Mayer [3] in his work on biquadratic fields.

The counterexamples are constructed by adjoining to the totally
real base-field k the quantity u'/%, where u is a totally positive integer
in k which is not a perfect square; we call 2(u'/?) = K. Next we consider
the prime ideal p dividing the odd rational prime p and the prime ideal
q dividing 2, in the ground-field 2. Then according to the well known
methods of Hilbert [2] the discriminant D, of K, and the discriminant
d, of k, are related by D =d?N(d) where N(b) is the norm (over R)
of the relative discriminant d. Assuming for convenience that d is
odd, we have d=6%? where © is the product of all p and q that di-
vide (1) to an odd power, and ¥ is the product of all q for which
the congruence p={? mod q*** is unsolvable for { an integer in &,
with e equal to the exponent of the power to which q divides (nu). In
the cases worked out fully (below) it will prove advantageous to
choose u relatively prime to 2 and such that the congruence p={?*
mod 4 is solvable, for then T=(1).

We take for the base-field k=R(cos 2r/l), of degree (I—1)/2,
where / is a prime > 35. For this field d=1(9/2,

(i) First we take p=35. Since (5) is unramified and p=1 mod 4,
then d= (u) and N(d) =5%V/2, Therefore KV =R(cos 2m/l, 5''?) de-
