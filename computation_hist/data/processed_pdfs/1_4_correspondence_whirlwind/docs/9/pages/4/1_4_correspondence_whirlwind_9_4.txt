this support could amount to ab@ut $50,000, though this is
{ ﬂJLL a Yﬂ ope a8 yet. '

ihe most optimistiec estimate w@ulé be to expect that,
though Linecoln will not giv« ub@ gupp@% t gives now, it still
will contribute enough &a that only g200, L”S a year extra would
be needed. If non-ONR projeets eo ?& contribute £80,000-3100, 000
and general industrial rwm@?ibn ;ions of g5@ 000 a year ecould be
raised, then only ; bwpﬁ*ﬂ to UYO 000 would be needed to carry through
1956-1957. Further extrapola ation beyond this date is obviously

grant an addi x”“TUQQ;O@@ 50 £30,000 to be used in 1955-1956
for WWl @p@:ubLJ g budget (1.e., supplementary funds for project
DIC 6345), that 350,000 to $70,000 be tentatively alloeated to
6345 for 1@5§~19311 that @Gafastyer funds be allocated for project
6915, and that in December 1955 the situationr be re-asvaluated to
see what later uéiﬂﬁ will be.

If this can be done, 1t will bse possible to furnish com-
puting time free to ONR projests at the Institute, as well as to

I bhope that this exposition answers the questions you
