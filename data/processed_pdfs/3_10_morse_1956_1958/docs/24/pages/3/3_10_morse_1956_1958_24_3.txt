WALKER MEMORIAL  Walker Memorial is the student
center. The great central room, Morss Hall, is an undergraduate
dining hall during the day and at night is often the scene of
smokers, meetings, dances, and other social activities. :

In the rear of the second floor is Pritchett Lounge, a unique
student night club, open also during the day for sandwiches
and snacks. On the top floor is the gymnasium. In the ba§en}en§

g the building are offices
student organizations.

STUDENT HOUSING Of the Institute’s 5,300.students,
about 3,000 live on the campus or in nearby fraternity houses
and clubs. The area to the west of Massachusqtts Avenue, knowg
as the West Campus, is devoted almost entirely to living an
recreation. At its western extremity 1s a devqlop_menl of houses
and apartments for 270 veterans and their families known as
Westgate and Westgate West. =

THE KRESGE AUDITORIUM AND M.I.T. CHAPEL

(continued from the reverse)

cameras can be plugged into the system. Television control trucks |

can be parked in the service driveway in the rear and plugged in ‘=

without any special installations. A television cable runs direct to

e nearby studios of WGBH.

Beneath the Auditorium is the Little Theater, designed for
intimate dramatic productions and small conferences and concerts. |
There are also two rehearsal rooms in the basement.

While the Auditorium is very modern in concept, the cylindrical
brick Chapel has such ancient antecedents that many people do not
associate its design with traditional church architecture. Incor-
porated 1n its planning were many new ideas.

Eero Saarinen sought to provide a building which could be
used by all of the faiths represented among the cosmopolitan
student body of M.I.'T. and which would not be identified with
any one of them. He wished to create an atmosphere that would
be conducive to worship and contemplation by the students.

Windows were not included in the design for the reason that the
architect felt the chapel should be a sanctuary from the outside
world—a place from which noise and bustle would he excluded.

Instead of windows, there is a ceiling port through which a shaft
of light streams down on the three-ton block of white marble which
serves the various faiths as an altar. The brilliance of this light is
enhanced by a screen, designed by the noted sculptor, Harry
Bertoia, of glittering gilt bits of metal brazed to vertical rods. These
gilt reflectors are more dense in number toward the base. tending
to keep attention attracted toward the altar.

Additional light is admitted to the chapel through horizontal
panels of glass concealed behind oak wainscoting. Licht reflected

~ Irom the water in the moat passes through these panels and falls

upon the walls in shimmering patterns.

One enters the chapel through a rectangular narthex with walls
of gray stained glass, which accustoms the eyes gradually to the
dimmer light inside and provides a transitional passage from the
distractions of the outer world to the contemplative atmosphere of
the sanctuary. The architect once described this entry as “a sort
of decompression chamber.”

The Holtkamp organ, a Bach type, is situated in a small loft
over the entrance to the chapel. The serpentine form of the brick
walls contributes to the excellent acoustics. Other acoustical devices
include the use of sound absorptive material behind brickwork
grilles.

In the basement are robing rooms for the clergy of various
denominations. Religious articles used in services are carried to
the altar by a small elevator.

The aluminum bell tower for the chapel, taller than the build-
ing itself, was designed by Theodore Roszak, a sculptor.

In addition to sudent services, the chapel is used for weddings
and other special occasions. Organ recitals are included in the
program for use of the building.
