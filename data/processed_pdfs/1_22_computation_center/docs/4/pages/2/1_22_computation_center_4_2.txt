Your mail came today -- fast service.
Give Price my regards -- tell him I hope 
they're healing him right & I'll see him 
in August. They have 3 704's here -- all 
in one room -- and is it noisy! Tell Frank 
Dean and Corby that the gang here are supervising 
the Stretch project with IBM -- do they know 
about it? They are now arguing about logic 
for this machine, and would be interest in our 
ideas for what needs improving in the 704 logic.
They are also building 2 new Maniacs! They can't 
seem to get enough machines. What dope do they
want me to get from Metropolis; Lougmire, Lazarus 
& Co.? (on programs or other machine dope)

Did Jack Carpenter leave a copy of his thesis 
for me? I could use it here! They're quite 
interested in opacities here. If there is a spare 
copy, mail it out; I'll mail it back.

Regards -- I hope it isn't too hot in
Boston. Regards to Judy & Iris.

Yours
PM

Ask Dean how Bradley Ross is getting along.
