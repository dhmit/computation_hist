E. Full-time staff for programming, research and
assistance in laboratory classes (one adminis-
trative head, one research head, fourteen staff,
salaries plus usual 40 per cent overhead, plus
travel, ete. yoof $150,000 per year

F. Funds to support research assistants, who would
help full-time staff and also learn machine use
(including usual 40 per cent overhead on
salaries) 70,000 per year

G. Costs for power, equivalent rental for space, etec.,
which might be charged against the 40 per cent
overhead included in B and C ?

(Budget for special equipment and staff used by MIT for adminis-
trative purposes, registration, alumni, etc. - g17,000 per year -
is not included here. Presumably this activity and its budget
would continue unchanged.

Power requirements, including power for air conditioning required
by equipment - 125 KW .

Space requirements for equipment, staff and classroom - 8,000 square
feet working area |

D would be donated by IBM. Part of E and F could be obtained
from grants from CNR, NSF and possible industrial grants, but it
is unlikely that more than g60,000 a year can be raised this way,
unless some presently unknown source 1s uncovered. The rest of
budgets E and F (about 160,000 per year) could be raised by
charging thoae DIC projects which can afford 1t, as we are doing
now. If we charged for machine time at $250 per hour (less than
"commercial®™ rates), we would need to "sell"™ about 700 of our
avallable 4,000 machine hours per year, which would not cut too
deeply into our educational and research agtivity. A survey of
the present computing services to DIC projects indicates that we
will probably have enough demand from projects able to pay so we
would not have to sell computer time outside MIT, unless govern-
ment support for DIC projects falls off considerably. This system
of charges would not be unfair to the DIC proJjects, becausze if
budgets E and F were supported entirely by direct grants, we would
use the center entirely for tralning and research, would not serve
these projects at all and they would have to rent their own machines
or buy time outside. It would be preferable to do.it this: way, of
course, 1f we could raise all the funds for E and F without having
to sell time.

Since some of the staff of E would be spending part of their
Ttime Teaching courses on machine uzse and supervising laboratory
work on the machines, poss8ibly part of this budget should be charged
