Dear Professor Morse:

In accordance with your request, I have examined the attached
request for proposal f+ PR&C Nos RPA=-1-58 which was received from the
Signal Corps Supply Agency, and I believe we are in no position to
submit a proposal atthiiis time.

There are several reasons for this:

1. The attached Request for Quotation is incomplete since
it does not contain any information regarding the technical
nature of the computations which are to be performed ==
no mathematical information is given.

2 Quite obviously this purchase request has merely been issued
to satisfy povermmental regulations; namely, the contractor
has a group in mind who intend to do the job and They are
merely releasing this request to make sure other bidders in
the field heave hed an opportunity to say no.

Since the proposal is required on May 9, there is obviously
insufficient time to take proper action on thise

ca
e

4¢ The contractor is very specific about the qualifications of
the personnel that are to be assigned to this task «=
"Doctor of Mathemsties, Applied Physics or equivalent w="
Truthfully, there is inadequate information on this request for
me to lmow what the problem actually is and I certainly don't think we
should consider it under the circumstances.

Sincerely yours,

Fe Me Verzuh
FiiVinb Director
