Minutes of the Fifth Meeting
of the Committee on Aachine
sethoas of Computation =P

under wualb.arrangements Verzuh can be supported financislly. If
it turns out that Verzuh camnot be spared thds cowing term, it
was suggested that Verzuh be given a year's leave of absence, be-
ginning in June, to prepsre for uis orals and to get well along
in his thesis (perhaps even complete it).

Booton has indicated tnut, 1f ne were asked to puss a
qualifying exemination incluaing electronics, he uwight have to
postpone his examination for & term in order to brush up on this
subject. The Committee investigated the possibility of Booton's
taking tine qualifying exauwination in matnemstics (his course work
indicates that this might be possible). The Committee felt that,
if ue were to continue his registration in the Electrical Engi-
neering Department and take anis thesis with an Electrical Engi-
neerinyg supervisor, Booton sioula aave sowe knowledge of elec-
tronics and that it would be therefore advisable for niu to take
the additional term to prepzre for an exawnination of the type
mentioned in the last minutes. On the other hund, if Booton
still wished to take the mathematics qualifying examination, he
should then transfer his registration to the Mathematicg Depart-
ment a&nd expect to teake his tnesis with a Mathematics Department
supervisor (although there could be readers for tne thesis from
tue BElectrical Engineerinyg Departwent). Tals latter alternative
mignt wean tnat ne would nave to modify anis plen for thesis to
scme extent, including more mathemutics in the research, but in
the end it was felt tnat this is desirable. There was some in-
dication that Carrus, uwentioned in the previous minutes, should
&lso consider tnese alternatives, Conseguently, no action will
be teken on & possible modified Elsctrical Engineering qualify-
ing exumination to be given in February, s&s mentioned in the pre-
vious minutes, until Kopal (ana pessibly sMorse) has taliked to
Booton and Carrus and found out their desires in this matter.

The next meeting of the Committee will be 9:30 Wednesday,
January 3, at which time the Comwittee will tike up the continu-
ing question of courses in tine field of machine computation, and
will start the consideration of possible contracts for the sup-
port of sowe of the meachines at the Institute.
