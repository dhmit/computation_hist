Gentlenen:

At the last meeting of the Trustees of IDA an effort was made to
identify ways in which IDA might develop more effeclively the educational
functian stated in its charter. At the end of this discussion I was
asked to give the matter some thought, and after cansultation with those
trustees who are professional educators, to develop a paper for the
September meeting that would attempt to put the problem in focus.

As a means of getting started, I am listing below & number of ways in
which IDA might interact with universities. I am also giving my own
comments on some of these items. It would be appreciated if those to
vhom this document is addressed would react to this list and my comments
thereon.

IDA will probably be able each year to devote a significant though not
large amount of money for educational purposes of a public service
character. IDA is also sble to provide certain types of experience and
training for university faculty through participation for limited terms
in IDA activities. Some of the possible types of interaction that might
exist between IDA and university educetional circles are as follows:

1. Pre~doctoral fellowships supported by IDA.
2. Post-doctoral fellowships sponsored by IDA.
3. Post-doctoral intermships for young PhDs to work at IDA
on assignments as interns rather than employees, i.e. under
circumstances where their presence at IDA is as much for the
purpose of self-improvement as it is for producing output
useful to IDA.
4. Baucational programs for IDA employees:
a. Pre-doctoral fellowships toc enable IDA employees to
return to college and complete doctoral programs.
