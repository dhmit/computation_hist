Dear Sir:

The MIT Computation Center recently replaced its
.computer with an IBM 7090 Data Processing System and is
taking this occasion to present a conference entitled
"The Future of Large-Scale Computing in Universities"
on Friday, January 26, 1962 at MIT. I am enclosing
a combined poster and program inviting the public to
this conference which I hope you will have posted on
the appropriate bulletin board.

I wish, also;, to extend my personal invitation to
you to attend this conference and ask that you, in turn,
extend this invitation to others you feel might find the
program interesting.

I look forward to seeing you at the conference.

Sincerely,

Direcggt
