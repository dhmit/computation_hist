Geometric tier Zahlen. By 0. H. Keller. Enzyklopadie der mathe-
matischen Wissenschaften mit Einschluss ihrer Anwendungen,

The title Geametn'e der Zahlen was introduced by Minkowski over
half a century ago. Its subject matter has naturally expanded
greatly, particularly in the last twenty years, and the author com-
mendably presents a more modern account of the subject. The aim of
the Enzyklopa'die is “to ﬁnd a middle road between the . . . historical
presentation and the . . . systematic presentation." The reviewer’s
impression is that the work tends to be more systematic than his-
torical, but the few isolated remarks that follow can in no way detract
from the debt owed to the author for his pioneering compilation.

One major pre—Minkowskian development is the study of the min-
ima of quadratic forms in 11 variables, elegantly interpreted as the
densest lattice packing of equal spheres in 71 dimensions. The dis-
covery, essentially, that the symmetric tetrahedral packing (with
n+1 mutually tangent spheres) is no longer densest when n = 4 is one
of the earliest indications that n-dimensional “Euclidean geometry”
would depend on n with “number-theoretic” irregularity. Strangely
enough, the footnote reference to this result (footnote 184a) does
not refer to its discovery (by Korkine and Zolatareﬂ in 1872) but

rather to a series of papers starting in 1948. The footnotes catch up
in the long run, if the reader uses his powers of deduction. But more
diﬁ‘icult is the deduction that the aforementioned result led to the
development of extremal methods and polyhedron packings.

The Minkowskian synthesis (i.e., the packing of space with general
convex bodies), certainly receives due attention, although a sense of
continuity with earlier work, particularly with that of Hermite, is not
made apparent. Likewise the contact between the geometry of num-
bers and algebraic number theory seems lost in the mass of details
again. The reviewer refers to the contact occurring when the alge—
braist had to work with inequalities not only to ﬁnd bounds on norms
but even to prove the discriminant theorem, which implies the fol-
lowing: “Every irreducible monic polynomial of degree at least two
and with integral coefﬁcients contains a repeated (polynomial) factor
modulo some prime.” Conversely in the last twenty years (owing
largely to the inﬂuence of Mordell, Davenport, and Mahler), the in-
tense desire for unimprovable bounds in algebraic number theory
caused the replacement of the convex body by the more general star
body. One contrast in presentation that the reader will immediately
note is that while the older methods (Minkowskian and earlier) are
often presented with enough detail (diagrams, tables, etc.) to excite
the non-specialist, the methods developed in the last twenty years
are given in little detail, with emphasis instead on lists of deﬁnitions,
theorems, and conjectures, and with a valuable bibliography drawn
up for 1951. Incidentally, a more modern bibliographical format
(alphabetically arranged, and containing the titles of the papers)
probably would be more useful.

The chapter titles are as follows: A. Convex bodies. B. Star bodies.
C. Linear forms. D. Minima of homogeneous forms. E. Inhomogene—
ous forms. F. Quadratic deﬁnite forms. G. Continued fractions. H.
Algebraic numbers. I, Partitions and lattice point ﬁgures. The re-
viewer feels that the inclusion of the last chapter is hardly justiﬁed
by the historical continuity presented, but that otherwise the titles
suggest that the geometry of numbers still would not be beyond
Minkowski‘s recognition.
