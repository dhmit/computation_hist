Dear Mr, Bryant:

The purpose ¢f this letter is to thank you for the fine
manner in which you have haridled the preparstion and distribution
of the Computation Center set of notes entitled "Coding for the
MIT-IBM 704 Computer”. We are indeed fortunate in having a central
distribution agency for handling these notes.

As we discussed at an earlier date, I am submitting an
invoice to you for $339 to cover the net cost for handling this trans~
action. You will recall that we agreed to charge you only for the
printing eost of the 380 copies of the notes which we turned over to
you. This gost was $356 from which we deducted $17 you had to pay to
print up the five (5) pages for the front of the book, leaving a net of
$339,

In ¢losing, I again want to thank you for your wholehearted
eooperation.

Sincerely yours,

F. M, Verzuh
Assistant Director
