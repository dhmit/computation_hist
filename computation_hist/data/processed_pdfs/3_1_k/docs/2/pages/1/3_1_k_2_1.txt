Mr. James G. n;gg :
Executive Ass 51';"" t.o
- the President |
Room 3-208 = " MIT

This note is in reply to your request for some information on
Mr. Philippe David. Mr. David plans to leave for this country on

February 4th, arrive in Cambridge on l‘obnury 1ith, and cuy at MIT
for approximately seven months.

o 1nv1:ed Mr. David to m last September on the smnctoa |
of Phil Morse. A colleague of Mr. David, Mr. Jacques Lestel, visited
us this past fall. David and Lestel are both members of a French
Operations Research Firm whose President is Mr. Charles Salzmann.

The Firm is interested in learnins more aboul: the simulation of
economic systems.

On the basis of discussions with Phtl Morse and Jacques Lestel,
I believe Mr. David expeects to spend most of his time working on my
computer simulation study of the American economy, This means he
will work mostly at the Computation Center and probably will make a
substantial request for 704 time., We have set aside some working
area for Mr. David at the S8chool of Industrial Management and have
asked for some additionmal space at the Computation Center.

Mr. David will receive no remuneration from MIT but is, I
believe, receiving & grant under the auspices of NATO. This grant
is intended to allow professional persons in Burope to work with
professional persons in America over an extended period of time,

Please let me know if there is any further information you

would like to have. I appreciate your help in obtaining guest status
for My. David.

Sincerely yours,
