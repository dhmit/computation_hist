Dear Cecil:

~~ We are shortly to move into our new
quarters in the Compton Lab, next to our new 704.
Part of our new quarters will be a document room,
in which we would like to collect material on
computing and machines of use to students. I
think it would be nice to have a complete file

of your "Approximation Newsletters" there. Could
you send us such a file? We'd be glad to pay
you, if it costs extra.

How 1s the work going? I regret we're
so far apart - I think you'd be interested in
some of our plans, and I'd sure like to have some
of the students talk to you some time.

Yours,

Philip M. Morse
Director

PMM: LWH
