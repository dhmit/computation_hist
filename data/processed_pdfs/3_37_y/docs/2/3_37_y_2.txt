Dear Miss Yates:

Professor Morse has shown me your letter of
November 4 wherein you inquire of the electronic computing
activities at M.I.T.

I am enclosing a copy of our most recent progress
report which I think answers most of your questions. If
I can be of any further assistance, please feel free to
write.

Sincerely,

F. J. Corbato
