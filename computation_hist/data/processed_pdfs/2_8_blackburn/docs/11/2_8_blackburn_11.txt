A sity, Providence, Rhode Island

This call was made with Mr. Paul G. Roland, IBM, Providence.
Professor Freiberger said that plans were underway for the transfer from

CPC operation to 650 operation, The CPC presently installed in the Applied
Mathematics Building will be movéd out on December 11 and replaced with
the 650 on December 27. After the 650 is moved in the machine list will be

I asked Professor Freiberger 's ‘pinion about present operational details of

the Computation Center at MIT. He stated that he felt that everything was
‘satisfactory. He felt that representatives from Brown had gotten very good
co-operation in such matters ag getting problem approval and subsequently
scheduling machine time, He also felt that the assistance received from
MIT's staff on such matters as use of library programs and special program-
ming techniques had been adequate. He said that all problems done thus far
had been fairly substantial problems and that the effort expended in getting
them on the machine was small in comparison with the magnitude of the job.

Professor Freiberger mentioned a rather large project under consideration
as a joint effort of Brown, Yale and Harvard. This was a problem of language
analysis and translation. He will probably apply for approval of this problem
in the near future.

I mentioned to Prof, Freiberger the plan for a meeting of representatives
from all the participating colleges in the near future probably on December 6.
