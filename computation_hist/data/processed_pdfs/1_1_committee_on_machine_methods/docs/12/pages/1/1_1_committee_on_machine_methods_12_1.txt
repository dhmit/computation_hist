Minutes of the Twelfth Meeting
of the
Committee on Machine lMethods of Computation

March 7, 1951

 

Persons Present: R. R. Everett, H. Feshbach, Z. Kopal, C. Lin
and P, MQ Morge & !

The Committee approved the reéommehdations of the Physics
Department that
F. J. Corbato

M., C. Newsteln
G. Spelsman
I’o S. FI‘iShkOpf

be appointed half-time Research Assistants in Applied Mathe-
matics and Machine Computation for next year (Corbato beginning
June) . Mathematics and Electrical Engineering candidates will
be reported on next week.

‘ IHorse reported that Kopal!s ONR contract for next year has
been approved and will be supervised by Jacchia.

Kopal reported that the Electrical Engineering Department
wished to hear the Committee’s oplinion on the continuing of
Welshman's course in machine coding next year (Welshman has
left the Whirlwind projsct). The Committee felt that such a
course is an important one and that it should be continued. Per-
haps Adans of the Whirlwind project could zive it next year.

 

Morse reported that the Industrial Liaison 0ffice (Mr.
Bavans) desired to fix the program and date of the proposed Con-
ference on the use of Large-scale Computers in Industry. The
first week in May eppeared to be a good time. Subsequent talk
with Mr. Bevans indicated that Wednesday-Thursday, May 2-3;,
would be the best days. The proposal is to have Morse, Verzuh
and Adamg talk the first morning on the general question of
machines, what they were and how they could be used. Wednesday
afternoon could be spent in hearing about the DA and visiting
it and Thursday morning could be spent hearing about and seelng
Whirlwind (though this order could be reversed). Bevans would
