Clarification of the FORTRAN-FAP Nonitor System
Description (Memorandum CC-160)

The description of the FORTRAN-FAP Monitor System (FMS), pre-
sented in CC-i60, is basically a preliminary version prepared by
IBM with only slight editing by the writers. In order to rapidly

distribute the information, extensive rewriting was not done,

In the interim between typing and reproduction, the following
changes have been found to improve the clarity of the Description,

P, 1, line 1, word 5: Replace "an” by "a slightly'.
P, 2, delete entire page except next to last paragraph,

P, 3, delete tables of Execute Job and Non-Execute Job and the
preceding seantence.

P, 4, line 4: The sentence beginning "The input program,..” by
“"The resultant program consists of a subprogram seqguence,
with one main subprogram, which should not be larger than
the available corc storage; this constitutes a "machine-load”,

P, 5, line 7: Insert at the beginning of the line "if it is
intended to terminate”.

iine 8: Replace "replaced"” by "superceded”.

P, 6, 1ine 7: Replace ''tape input-output” by 'CHAIN",

P, 19, 1line 14: Replace "NOT REWOUND BY PROGRAM" by "NOT REWOUND
BY MONITOR".
