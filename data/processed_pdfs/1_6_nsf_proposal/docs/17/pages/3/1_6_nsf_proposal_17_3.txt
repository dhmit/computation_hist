put out a combined progress report. In some published papers,
credit could be given to one organization alone; in others, credi%
would go to both. Bookkeeping would be somewhat more complicated,
but since most of the expense would be for salaries, 1little for
permanent equipment, this could be done. It probably would be
necessary to have the usual government overhead for both contracts.
The proposed budget asked of each agency for 1956-57 18
given below. The corresponding amounts for the following two years
would be 245,000 for 1957-58 and $50,000 for 1958-59, as indicated
above, : et Â£, .

proposed Research; Possible Initial Directions of Investigation:

1. Investigation of Structure and Syntax of input:
languages; the possibilities of coding direcfly in mathematical,
logical or business language. ' v

2. Development of routines capable of translating from
algebraic notation to computer code and vice versa, including
possibly automatic selection of numerical techniques and auvtomatic.
error analysis. X : ,' ~ o i 3"

3, Development of numerical analytic technlques particu-
larly sultable for use by dilgital computers; guch as more . general
expansions, truncated Chebyshev polynomials sums for gimulating
standard functions by a common block of instructions bubt small
separate blocks of coefficients and cycle counters and wethods of
automatic determination of best grid spsclng, by trlal plus |
Richardson extrapolation or other means, | AL

L. Investigation of Monte Carlo techniques for large
problems. | _

5. Extension and /or improvement of present techniques
for communication between machine and operator and for the more
flexible control of machine operation, including possible improve-
ments 1in input-output equipment. | ~
