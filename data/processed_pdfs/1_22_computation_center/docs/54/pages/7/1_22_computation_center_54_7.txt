3. Previous Experience: experience has revealed that thero are certain prrotesa:lanal
fields that are potential sources for good programmers. Graduates of certain
colleges, particularly those teaching numerical analyasis in the udergraduate
curriculum, have proven to bo en excellent source of programmers.

4. Technical Skills: a training in EAM equipment is desirable but not essential.

9. Compatibility: the need to get along with other individuals ocutside the EDFM
group . is strongly dependent on the mode of operation. In a closed-shop”
programming operation the programer accepts a problem statement from the
originator and carries through the entire a.nalysis, programning, coding, and
machine solution. It is, therefore, important that a closed-ghop programmer
be able to get along with the problen eriginater.

6. Accuracy: the preparation of mph:lne programs is a costly and expensive operation.
Obviously a person who can write accurate machine instructions is extremely
valuable. For example, a top-notch programmer recently prepared a program of
6,000 instructions in 34 hours -= containing only 1 error. Accuracy is most
1nportant' . 5 - vl g N

7. "Physical Appearancoz the need for attractive appearapce' is Qgsential,

TRAINING PERIOD

A complete course in the programming field will reguire & minimm of six (6) intensive
