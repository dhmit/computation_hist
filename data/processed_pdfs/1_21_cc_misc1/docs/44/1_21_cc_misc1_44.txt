Dear Mr. Shader:

On behalf of Dr. J. A. Stratton, I should like
to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of February Sth,
and express his appreciation and that of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology for the enclosed check for $14,980
to provide funds for the IBM Research Assistants and IBM
Research Associates at the M.I.T. Computation Center for
the second half of the academic year 1957-58.

All of us are delighted at the progress being
undertaken and carried out by Professor Morse in the
Computation Center. I am certain that the program will
benefit all concerned in addition to doing much in
furthering the educational needs of the country.

 

Sincerely yours,

James CG. Kelso
Executive Assistant
