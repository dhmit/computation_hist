Dear Dr. Knowles:

AE SE It is with a great deal of pleasure that I enclose our check
for $3, 000.00 representing the first semester portion of the stipends
~ for the IBM Research Associates and Assistants recently appointed
for the 1959-60 school year in connection with the MIT.
Computation Center. A detailed description of the appointments is

| The increasing use of the IBM 704 Computer at M.I.T. by
the New England colleges both as an educational device and a research
tool has been very encouraging to IBM, and we are delighted that
Northeastern is having an active part in it as represented by these

research appointments.
