Reference: Contract N50ri-06001

Dear Sir:

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology submits
herewith a proposal for extension of the reference contract to
June 30, 1957 at an additional estimated cost of-S20,960.00.

We understand that this proposal has been the subject of discus—
sions between Professor P, M. Morse of MIT and Mr. A. J. Wise
of ONRmMIT, Dr. Carl F. Mukenhaupt of OanBoston, and Dr. F; Jo
Weyl of OﬂRwWashington.

There follows a summary of expenditures and funds
remaining on the two projects, Whirlwind Operation and Machine
Methods of Computation, which are currently active under the
reference contract:

Project #63”: (Whirlwind Operation) has an unexpended
balance of $9?,000 as of November 30, 1955. The current expend—
itures are approximately $10,000 per month. The average “income“
received for Whirlwind usage is approximately $3,000 per month —-
a net expenditure of $7,000 per month. If it is assumed that the
present level of income ($3.000 per month) is maintained during
the nineteenumonth period December 1, 1955 to June 30, 1957, a
minimum amount, assuming some tapering off, of $ll9,000 will be
required during this periodo

Project #6 1‘ (Machine Methods of Computation) has an
unexpended balance of E7 ,000 as of November 30, 1955. The current
expenditures are approximately $7,000 per month. If it assumed
that the present expenditures remain constant, there will be a
balance of approximately $22,000 on June 30, 1956. In accordance
with our present plans for terminating the ONR support of this
project on June 30, 1956” there will be certain additional term—
inating expenditures. It is estimated that $7,000 will be
expended for termination pvrpoees.

This summary is based on estimates prepared by Prof-
essor P. M" Morseo

Professor Morse further advises that the expected
arrival of an IBM Type 70% Electronic Data Processing Machine at
MIT about January 1, 1957 will create a definite need for addi—
tional Tunds_-to finance the conversion of existing Whirlwind
programs to Type 704 programs.
