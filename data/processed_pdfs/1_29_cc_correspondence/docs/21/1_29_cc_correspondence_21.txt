Dear Mr. Mason:

1 am sending a problem application form of the Computation Center at M.I.T.
When I submitted the test run which 1 am enclosing, it took ebout 6.5 minutes.
This should help you to estimate the total time.

‘1 asked the Industrial Manageupnt Office about seat reservations. Unfortunate-
ly tickets for both the Sth and were all gone but, 1 was informed that we
may be able tO £ind vecant seats if we go there early. :
There is no difference in instructions between the 706 and the 709 program
of the GQS. You can make data cards according to the instructions in the
"Tech. Report 15". 2

Yours truly,

Shinji Kataoka
