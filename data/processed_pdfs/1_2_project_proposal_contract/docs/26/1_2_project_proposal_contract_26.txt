SUBJECT: Continuation of Contract N5ori06001 (D.I.C. 6345 and
6915) beyond current expiration date for the period
1 July 1955 through 30 June 1956

REFERENCE: O.N.R. Contract N5ori06001

In accordance with conversations with O.N.R. represen-
tatives in Washington and Boston, we recommend applying to O.N.R.
for an additional $30,000 to supplement expenditures of Projects
6345 and 6915 for 1955-1956, so they may be continued at the
agreed-on level. Project 6915 will be tapered off next year. It
probably will have about Z70,000 unexpended of funds already allo-
cated and its part of the budget will be about this amount, 80 no
more is needed for this part of the work.

Project 6345 (WWl operation) will have an increased
budget next year of about $160,000, caused by the considerable
increase in the use of WWl1l for pure research, by groups in all
Departments of the Institute. The increased cost of this increase
in gid to research work will be borne by instituting a system of
charges for machine time to those non-O0.N.R. projects at M.I.T.
which can afford to help, in accordance with a procedure which has
been approved by O.N.R. It is estimated that the "income" from
these charges will be about 260,000 next year. In addition, about
70,000 will be left unexpended, of funds already allocated to
GH, by 30 June 1955. ‘rhis leaves $%0,000 toc be requested in
new funds. The details of the combined budget for the two projects
