COMMITTEE ON MACHINE METHODS OF COMPUTATION

@
Minutes of the Ninth Meeting
April 28, 1954

Persons Present: C. W. Adams, S. H. Caldwell, H. PFeshbsach,
F. B. Hildebrand, C. C. Lin, P. M. Morse,
W. W. Seifert, P. M. Verzuh

The first draft of the memorandum to the Adminis-
tration on Requirements for Electronic Computing Equipment
for Educational Uses was discussed. Some changes were made
in the phraseology, and a few additions were made for clari-
fication. The modified memorandum will be sent to Dr. Stratton
and Professor Floe, and Morse will follow this up with dis-
cussions.

 

 

The machine seminars, held this year every other
week, were discussed. It was suggested that tel have been
trying to cover too much ground and to interest too wide an
audience, and that this is the reason for the large fluctua-
tions in attendance. It was suggested that we start, next
year, with the staff members of the Project and with the
Committee Members and build a seminar which would be primarily
of interest to this group. The interesting of others would
be desirable but not a primary consideration.

Lin reported that Williams is not accepting the
offer tendered him. Feshbach is investigating one other pos- .
sibility (Purkis) and will report back in a week. ee

There is to be a meeting with Dr. J. Weyl of ONR
on Friday, May 7, at 1:30 p.m. to discuss the future of the
Project (1956 on).

There will be no further meetings of the Committee
this academic year. The Chairman will call a meeting early

in the fall term.
