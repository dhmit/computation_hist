Dear Professor Morse:

First I want to apologize for the delay in answering your
letter of March 14 in a formal way, As I told you, I wanted to
work out the answers to all the questions raised in your letter
before giving you a written reply.

I think we have arrived at a price structure which comes
very close to those suggested in your letter. Specifically, Dr.
Blackburn has informed you of what we can do for the real time
package and he will be in touch with you to discuss the blower
removal question in the next few days,

I hope that these arrangements will be satisfactory and

1 again want to apologize for the time delay required to make these
arrangements,

Sincerely yours,

M. A, Shader, Manager
