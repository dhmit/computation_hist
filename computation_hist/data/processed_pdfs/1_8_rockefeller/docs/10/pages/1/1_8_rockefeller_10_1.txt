Dear Chancellor Stratton:

I have the honor to inform you that at a meeting of the
Board of Trustees of The Rockefeller Foundation on December L and 5,
1956, action was taken providing up to $98,L00 to the Massachusetts
Ingstitute of Technology for use under the direction of Professor
Philip M, Morse, toward the costs of exploring the potential uses
of high-speed computing equipment in the solution of theoretical
and applied problems in the social sciences, This sum is for use
during the three~year period beginning July 1, 1957.

It is understood that if at any time Professor Morse ceases
to be in active direction of this research, there shall be no commit-

the beginning of each year of a budget for the program, We shall
appreciate receiving also anmial statements of receipts and expendi-
