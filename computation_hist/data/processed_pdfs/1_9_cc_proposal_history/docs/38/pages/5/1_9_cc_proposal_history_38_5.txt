IV. BUGGESTIONS AKD RECGRMENDATIONS

1. Dstermine the installation site (Instruzentation Laboratory or
Statistical Services) of the Type 650 C-lculator which is to be
delivered in June, 19855.

2. Approach the IBM Corporation via top-level Administrative channels
concerning the egquipment shown in Table II.

3. Statistical Bervices must have an internally-stored programmed
calculator for MIT use on non-opuifiod wvork, e.g. the IEN
Type 708 or the 850 Caleculator.

if neither of these is soconomicmlly fessible, then the
purchase of a CRC 102D or & Congolidated Drum Calculator ghould
be considered. '

4. Although the glocia:l.on reached on the above will dotermine the
. actusl computer space regjuirements, it is now imperative that space
be elliocated for computational eguipment.

6, The fortheoming availability of the new Whirlwind Computer (WWII)
early in 1855 will eliminate the present Lincoln Laboratory use
of WWl. It is estimated that it will cost $300,000 per year to
operate Wil as an HIT fecility. A decision should now be made
regarding the disposition of WWl and its associsted effect on the
MIT computational program.

6. It must be emphesized that the NIT requirements for large cuzumo
(700 sories) is increasing becsuse of the future research in Atoms
for Peace,” business spplications, indesirial lieison, etc. programs.
