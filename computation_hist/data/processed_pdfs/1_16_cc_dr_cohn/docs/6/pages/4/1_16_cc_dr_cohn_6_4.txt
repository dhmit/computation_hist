RIEMANN FUNCTION 299

We observe that (5) is an ordinary differential equation of second order with
only one initial condition. This, however, is natural since (5a) has onlv one
solution regular at U = 0. For if we were to expand both U and far; i/ 1/)
into powers of (I — x’) and (y — y’), we should find that they each begin ivith
the term (1 —— x’) (y — y’)H(.r’ + y’), whencef(U; 1", y’) = U + aw, y’)L72 +

Thus at U : 0, equation (5a) has both characteristic exponents zero,
which implies that (5a) has a solution R, regular and equal to unity at (7 = 0
and a solution It2 with a logarithmic singularity at U = 0. Thus {5) uniquelv
determines a Riemann function R = R. (U; .1", y’) V

Unfortunately only very few cases are covered by this artifice. The condition
that the Jacobian of (GU/61‘) (BU/61011" and l' with respect to a: and y vanish
can be regarded as an identity in I’ and y’ for any given a: and y This identity
in turn leads to an ordinary differential equation if we develop H into power
series about the point 7' = .L‘ + y. Then the identity implies the vanishing of
an inﬁnite series in the variables x’, y’ with coefficients expressible in terms of
H(r) and its derivatives Since the coefficients of such a series must vanish,
we obtain an ordinary differential equation for [1(7‘), namely

d/rlr[H"dzH/d7‘2 — 3/2(dl'lI/Hdr)2] : 0,

 

which has as its general solution
(6) H(r) = —)\()\ + Uni/sinh2 Mr + u)

where h, n, v are constants This is the value of H(r) for which we shall derive

a Riemann function via (5).
In obtaining the Riemann function corresponding to the value of H(r) given

in (G), we ﬁnd that
l' = —)\()\ + I) log (1 + V),
where

sinh [4(1‘ — .v’) sinh “(y — 1/)

V = — ——————.

In terms of 1" equation (5) becomes

[ V(I — V)d3R/'<ll"" + (1 7 mum/(1V + m + 01:) : 0

I? = l at l' = 0,

and its solution, a hypergeometric function, is the Riemann function corre-
sponding to H(r) in ((3), namely,

(7) RLL‘, 31;.1", y’) = ["(1 + >\, —)x; l; V),

The form of 11(7‘) in (6) is seen to have a few simpler limiting cases. First
Of Ell, we Can change >\ to h exp u and let v A» on, obtaining in the limit [1(7) =
