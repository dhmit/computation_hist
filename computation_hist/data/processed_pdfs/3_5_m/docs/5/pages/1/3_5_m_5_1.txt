Dear Ir . Mensch:

Thanks very Inch for your prompt notion in preparing the
invoices for the ma Corporation under our operating contacts with
the corporation. 1 would like to ask you to make a slight ohange 1n
tuture invoices; namely, 1 would like the nanes and salaries of
individuals deleted from future invoices. This is consistent with our
operating agreement and discussions held with lessrs. Cusiek. Blackburn.
Gallon, and Verzuh on October 23, 1957. At tut meeting it was agreed
that Dr. Blackburn would be continuously informed of the salaries and
rates or all participating personnel. However, the invoices as such
would not contain this information. It is further-ore desirable to avoid
I salary breakdown since the last invoice contains the salary 01' Prof. Horse
and this, of oourse, is something we need not include on any of our invoices.

I recommend that we retain the present format; however. merely
refer to salaries as follows: two key punch operators and one machine
operator on Paragraph 17, one key punch and one machine operator on Paragraph
18, and "staff salaries" on Paragraph 18.

Sincerely yours ,

F. M. Verzuh
Assistant Director
