PROPOSAL FOR EXTENSION 01’ NS? GRANT No. NSFGZQHO
to June 20. 1260

In recent discussions with NSF staff it was suggested
that it would be appropriate to request funds for the next
three years, instead of Just for next year. Since the
program outlined in the Original Proposal, dated April 1956
and the recent Request for Extension, dated March 1957. is
for a three-year period, it certainly is appropriate to
request support for all three years now, since this has been
suggested by NSF.

I am therefore appending to this an estimated budget
for the two years from July 1, 1958 to June 30, 1960, which
is to be considered as an additional part of the Proposal
sent to NBF'by DSR April 9, 1957, extending it for two more

years .
