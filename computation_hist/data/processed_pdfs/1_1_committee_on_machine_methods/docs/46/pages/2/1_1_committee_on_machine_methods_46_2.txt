1. How are tables made?
2. What functions need to be tabulated?
2. What form should tables have?

. What should this country do about producing
tables?

It is suggested that the conference room in the Hayden Library
be used and that arrangements be made to house the ra'onferees
together, if possible. Conclusions of the conference, and
whatever recommendations are arrived at, would be published
for presentation to the Science Foundation and to the Institute
and for distribution to other interested parties.

6. This conference can be planned and organized
by the Institute Committee on ﬂachine Calculation and Numerical
Analysis, which has the following membership:

Philip H. Horse, Chairman, Professor of Physics

S. H. Jaldwell, Professor of Electrical Engineering
Herman Feshbach, Associate Professor of Physics

J. W. Forrester, Director, Project Whirlwind

F. B. Hildebrand, Associate Professor of mathematics
J. A. Hrones, Professor of Mechanical Engineering
c. 0. Lin, Professor of Mathematics

7. The budget required would be for travel and
subsistence expenses of the participants and for the prepara-
tion and publication of the Report of the Conference. If we
assume that some of the conferees come from Washington and
some from California, we might expect on average fare plus
personal expenses of about 3180 a person. In addition, there
will be some secretarial costs, publication costs and inci-
dentals, so the budget would appear to be as follows, for 25
participants:

Travel fare (average RT 3140) -------------- $3,500
Expenms (average for 2 days, $150) --------- 1,000
Secretu‘ial aid--——--—-—w----_ -------------- 200

Producing and distributing report
(100 rages, est.) ------------------------ 300
Incidentals --------------------------------- __g_qg
Total $5,200

This would appear to be a reasonable figure. If the cost
turned out to be 1:33 (some participants might come at their
own or other expeuo), the excess em be returned to the
Foundation.
