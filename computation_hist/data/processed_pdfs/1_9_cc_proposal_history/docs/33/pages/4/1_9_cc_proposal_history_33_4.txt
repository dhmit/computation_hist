techniques in the course of their thesis research. These assistant-

 

ships have been very fruitful in the spread of the understanding
of machine capébilities throughéqt:the Institute, for not only
does the graduate student and hié'lmnediate assoclates learn
about computing machines and thelr use but, even more 1mportaht,
his faculty advisors in the varlous departments have a chance to ‘ﬂﬁ
learn of the usefulness of the new machines in their specilal i
fields. Tnpese advisors have sent more students to learn about
machine computation and have initlated more research using machine
results. For example, most of the professors of theoretlcal physics
are supervising thesis researgh in nuclear theory or solid state
theory, the computation of which will be done by Whirlwind or by
the I.B.M. equipment we have. Our research in nuclear reactor
design wi;l have to be done with machine help.
Many of our best and most 1maginat1ve machine programmers
have been introduced to computing equipment via these Assistant-
ships. They started out being interested in machines as a tool
to help them in thelr research in physies or chemical engineering
or whatever; they ended by being interested in the operation of
the equipment itself. Such assistantships or fellowships are a
vital part of our training program; their number should be in-
creased as soon as more machine facilities become availlable.
Future Expansion - With a few exceptions, it will not be necessary
to increase appreclably the number of courses concerned with
machine computation, if more machine facilitles become available;
what will be important willl be the increase in contact hours per

gstudent with the equipment. Some of the courses listed above now
