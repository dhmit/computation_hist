Dear Professor Morse:

We have discussed with Mr. Cusick the temporary
space situation for IBM. We have arranged to assign the
one bay 20C-226 to IBM temporarily for the period
Qctober 31, 1956 - April 1, 1957 inclusive. On April 2, 1957
the Technique will again need this room.

It should be clearly understood that the adjoining
classroom, 20C-228, cannot be released to IBM as this room
will be needed for classes all year.

Very truly yours,

Sl b
