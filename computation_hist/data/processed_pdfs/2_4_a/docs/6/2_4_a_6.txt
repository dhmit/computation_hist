Dear Professor Morse:

Although your name is not on the list of members of
the Mathematical Association of America, I feel confident that you are
sympathetic toward the aims of the Association and that you are acquain-
ted, at least in a casual way, with our official journal, The American
Mathematical Monthly. I enclose an outline of a proposed special issue
of the MONTHLY, along with a letter of solicitation which was sent out |
to quite a number of prospective authors last month. We have had fife SIX-
teen acceptances and are thus assured that there will be a special issue
and that many of the articles will be of very high quality.

It occurred to me recently that you may very likely )
have seen computing activities quite different from those familiar to
academic mathematicians. Your experience may have led you to have ideas
about computers and computing which would be less orthodox than those of |
other practioners or would, in any event, embody a different viewpoint.
We would all be delighted if you could be persuaded to contribute an
article on a topic of your own choice. The outline, which is already
somewhat scrambled, could be adjusted easily to accommodate it. —

TI may add that over fifteen thousand copies are
printed of current issues of the MONTHLY, and they go, quite literally,
all over the world. You would do the profession a valuable service by
addressing yourself to this large audience. We shall be delighted if

we may have a paper from you. I enclose a return postal for your con-
venience.

With warm personal greetings and every good wish,
Most cordially yours,
4 Caf.
