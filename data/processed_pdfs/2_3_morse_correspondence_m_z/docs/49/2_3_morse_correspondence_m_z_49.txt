Dear Dr. Glaser:

Pen Herring tells me you are writing a memo on
the possible uses of digital computers in the soclal
aciences. 1 recent ly wrote to Pen, saying that we were in
the process of installing a 704 for unclassified research
and education, and that we ought to investigate some
applications in social science. Tt seems that we should
get together soon and exchange views.

out-of-town schedule is frozen through March,
put I have some time here. would it be possible for you
to come up here for a day, either Tuesday or Thursday,
some time in March? You may find some developments of
interest here, and Tim sure we'll get some interesting

ideas from you.
Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse, Director
