Arthur Grad says it will be
about another week till the official
notification comes, The application
is with the grants office now and he
will see that it is dealt with,

I can't understand why you
didn't know the details of the meeting.
Gordon Walker discussed them all with
you over the phone to Caneveral, beth
time and place, and you asked me through
him to phone all the members of the committee
to see whether it suited them; if so, we
should go shead, I am now working on
completing the list of centers, Reeves
has my draft and promises me the final
version at the end of this week, I think
we should invite a faﬂﬂpy large batch of
veonle at the same time: otherwise some
will undoubtedly hear who have not been
invited and that would be bad, So rather
than invite a few right now, it is surely
better to wait for the N,S.F. reply, when
the exact details will be known, A good
many veople will read the Notices of the

~ s w . T
ANM.S, anyway.

Grad will be at the stability
symposium in New York Thursday and I shall
s I'1]l report back to you next week -
