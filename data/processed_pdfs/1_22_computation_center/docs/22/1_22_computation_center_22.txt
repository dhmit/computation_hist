Dear Corby:

You asked me to set down some of the things that I thought the Center
might do to further the project on the implications of digital computers
for social science research, or rather the things that I expected or would
like to have seen as part of the project,

 

I would like to state again that what I put down is not to be taken
as criticism, My stay here has been extremely fruitful and it is only
as the situation has changed at Chapel Hill that I have been forced to
make a decision between costs and retumms,

 

In the first place, you notice that I refer to the project on The
Implications of Digital Computers for Social Science Research. Korbel,
Cohen, and I had assumed the existence of such a project from the news-
paper announcements of the grant. Here one gets no feeling of the exis-
tence of this as a project. No one who is regularly a part of the Center
feels involved in it, and those of us who have come in from the outside
are uncertain to whom to turn with requests for assistance. There is no
project director, and let me hasten to say that by project director I do
not mean someone who directs research, I simply mean someone who facili-
| tates research by having the responsibility of listening to requests and,
| wherever possible, providing for the research needs of those in the pro-

| ject, whether the requests be for something as s'mple as a typewriter

| or for funds to bring some particular specialist half-way across the

| country for a two-day session on some particular topic, Preferably, such
a project director would be someone who is himself involved in this area

of research and who would accept administrative duties of the sort sug-
gested above not for additional pay but in order to further an area of
research in which he is interested. Such a person must have a certain
| amount of responsibility and authority and clearly specified channels of
operation, It is probably unnecessary to add that Dr. Verzuh does not
meet this need,

In addition to the social scientists here who are interested in
applying digital computers to their social science problems, I had expected

to find a counterpart to work with in at least one computer specialist
with a real interest in applying the potentialities of digital computers
to social science problems, The lack of such a person to whom one could
feel free to turn with questions has been a real handicap, We have
bothered Murray Watson with a lot of our questions, but always with the
knowledge that he was involved in another project (the post mortem pro-
gram) and that we were imposing on him. The extent of the need for such
a counterpart is reflected in what has happened to Korbel and Cohen,
Korbel's advisor at Harvard has gotten IBM to assign one of their men to
spend some time with Korbel answering questions, going over his program
with him, etc. Cohen has developed a working arrangement with a fellow
in the Business School at Harvard to help him in the same way, I know
that you don't want to assign 2 person 2 task of this sort, and you should
not, I had assumed the existence in the project of a computer specialist

Apart from the mainly organizational aspects discussed above, there
are several specific topics that the social science people here would
probably be interested in. One would be a discussion by a qualified
machine person of Max Palevsky's paper "An Approach to Digital Simulation"
in Proceedings of National Simulation Uonference, 1956, po. 18.1-18.k,
This would involve reasons for his assumption that analog computers have
advantages over digital computers in simulation, and whether this holds
true for social science in view of the types of models that social scien
tists have and can produce, To follow up on this latter line would prob-
ably require bringing in some outside social scientists for seminars, It
would also be interesting to know something of previous uses of the 70)
in similation, and, if the Bendix D183 is Superior for simulation, what
are its characteristics, and how efficiently can the 70} simulate it?

A series of sessions on the nature and use of Monte Carlo methods
would be valuable,

the fact that there is a lack of understanding of some of the real dife
[erences between social science data and physical science data. The
lectures of Dr, Hildebrand that I heard were interesting and obviously
basic to many problems but had little relevance to the problems of social
science because at the present time the nature of social science data

and problems is so divergent from mathematics and physical science prob-

lems, A discussion of the nature of the differences and their implica-
tions should be fruitful.

A discussion of the problems involved in putting Share subroutines
on Fortran would be of interest, According to my understanding of the
Fortran manual, this would not be difficult, yet the fact that this ape
parently is not done must have some basis,

in deciding when to use tape, when to use cards, when to use on-line equip-
ment, when to use off-line equipment, What are the limitations, if any,

in printing or punching off-line from tape (for example, I don't believe

it is possible to print out from tape in a different order from that in
which the tape was made),

many social scientists would be interested in such a program. I believe
Cohen would agree with me that such a Program would probably involve having
such people as Phil Green and Wilfred Gibson in ss consultants for brief

Another interesting program similar to latent structure but Simpler
in many aspects would be a program for developing a Guttman scale. Prac.
tically all present methods rely at some point on the human judgement of
the appearance of a pattern. It would be interesting to develop criteria
for the machine to use, or, at worst, to develop a program for using the
CRT in identifying the pattern,

I have doubtless written more now than is worth your time to read
and I still haven't said anything about actual research designs, methods
of data Collection, ete., etc. Again let me say that this is not to be
taken as criticism, You asked me to Jot down some of my ideas and I Just
let myself go on how I visualized a project on the implications of digital
computers for social science research, An extra copy of this letter is
enclosed so that you can give it to Professor Morse,

Sincerely yours,

P.S, May I Suggest that, if possible, a typewriter of some description
(definitely not electric) be made available to the people on the second
floor, For many people a typewriter greatly facilitates the recording
of ideas, and this in turn stimulates more ideas, and besides, it is one
of the amenities of research,
