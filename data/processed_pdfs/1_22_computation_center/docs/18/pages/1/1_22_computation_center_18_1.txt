Dear Dr. Gery:

This letter is in reply to your letter of June 19, 1957
to Professor Morse. The procedure by which Eastern Nazarene
College may become a Participating College of the Computation
Center is the following. The President of Eastern Nazarene
sholild write to Professor P, M, Morse, Director, Computation
Center, requesting that Eastern Nazarene be accepted as a
Participating College of the Computation Center and that a
member of the faculty, designated by the President be the
Institutional Representative to the Center.

The Institutional Representative should be a rson
who 18 interested in the activities of the Center (perhaps
yourself), and who the Center can contact for all the detalls
of the participation of the College.

I enclose two copies of the memorandum CC-18 which gives
details of the facilities of the Center. The facilities of
the Center are available for research by any member in good
standing of the Participating Colleges. In addition I
enclose two copies of the brochure concerning the IBM
Research Appointment Program which wae distributed early
this year.

If I can be of any further assistance, do not hesitate
to contact me.

Sincerely,
