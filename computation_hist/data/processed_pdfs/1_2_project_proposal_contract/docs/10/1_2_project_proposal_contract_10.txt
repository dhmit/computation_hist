Dear 8ir:

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology submits
herewith a revised proposal for extension of the reference contract
to June 30, 1957 at an additional estimated cost of #20,960,00,

Wwe understand that thie proposal has been the subject of dlsous-
sions between Professor P. M, Morse of MIT and Mr. A. J. Wise

of ONR=MIT, Dr, Carl F. Mukenhaupt of ONR-Bosgton, and Dr. F, J.
Weyl of ONR=Washington.

There follows a summary of expenditures and funds
remaining on the two projects, whirlwind Operation and Machine
Methods of Computation, which are currently active under the
reference contract:

Projeot #6345 (Whirlwind Operation) hag an unexpended
palance of $97,000 as of November 30, 1955, The ourrent axpend-
{tures are approximately $10,000 per month, The average "income"
received for Whirlwind usage 1s approximately $3,000 per month ==
a net expenditure of $7,000 per month, If it is assumed that the
present level of income ($3,000 per month) is maintalhed during
the ninetsen-month period December 1, 1955 to June 30, 1957, a
minimum amount, assuming some tapering off, of $119,000 will be
required during this period,

However, for the purpose of Ssiablisk ob Or estimate of
unexpended funds on thls project as of Juns 30, 1956, it is es¥i-
mated thet a higher level of income will exist during the remaining
geven months. Thls may average something sbove 8,000 a month, On
this basie we estimate that $57,000 of the #97 000 mentioned above
+111 remain unexpended as of June 30, 1956, An additional factor
affecting the budget shown on page bh 4a the estimated Computer

Income for the one-year period ending June 20, 1957. For this period
only $18,000 in Computer Income has been estimated, Thig ig in=-
fluenced by two factors: one being an expected tapering=-off of the
use of the Whirlwind machine by other projects, and secondly the
expected beginning of operations under the TEM Type 704 machine,

Project #6915 (Machine Methods of Computation) has an
unexpended balance of $71,000 as of November 30, 1655, The current
expenditures are approximately $7,000 per month, If it is assumed
that the present expéndltures remain conatant, there will be a balance
of approximately $22,000 on June 30, 1956, In accordance with our
present’ plans’ for terminating the ONR suppor’ of this project on
June 30, 1956, there will be certain additional costs extimated at
$7,000 assoclated with the closing out of this project including such

ltems ag the preparation of summary reports on the program of
Machine Methods of Computation,

This summary is based on estimates prepared by Prof-
eggor P, M, Morse,

Professor Morse further advises that the expected
arrival of an IBM Type 704 Electronic Data Processing Machine at
MIT about January 1, 1957 will create a definite need for addi-
Tlonal funds--to finance the conversion of existing Whirlwind
programe to Type 704 programs,

Under the proposed plan submitted herewith, Project
#6345 (Whirlwind Operation) would terminate on June 30, 1957.
The task order for this period would include the usual Whirlwind
project activities: |

1. Research in methods of numerical analysis and
the formulation of scientific problems for machine
solution, together with the training of personnel
in these methods,

2, Support of the Sclentiflc and Ingineering Applica-
tions Group of Project Whirlwind so as to make the
computer useful and aveilable for the above-mentioned
research,

In addition, 1t 1s proposed that the following task
order arising in connection with the Type 704 EDPM be included:

3. The development of a suitable interpretive program
and associated coding techniques to permit effective
implementation of the Type 704 machine,

It 1s anticlpated that a separate project will be set
up to handle the Type 704 utilization within the MIT Computation
Center, and a separate request To the ONR for support of this work
will be made in the near future. In this respect certain
experienced programmers could be made avallable for transfer to
this new task as of January 1, 1957. This enticipated transfer
has been taken into account in the budget proposed for Project #6345,

The foregoing proposal does not take into consideration
termination costs which may be associated wlth the close out of
thls contract and the possible disposition of the Whirlwind Computer.
It is proposed to delay the submittal of sny budget for this matter
until such time as disposition of the Whirlwind Computer is
determined,
