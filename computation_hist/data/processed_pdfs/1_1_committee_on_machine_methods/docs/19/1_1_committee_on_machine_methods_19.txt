The Committee members looked over the preliminary draft
of the first Quarterly Report. After some discussion, it was de-
cided that this report be bound separately from the Whirlwind re-
port concerned with the other portion of the money received from
ONE. Details of binding and of title are to be worked out between
Morse and Mr. Fahnestock. Reissner is to check as to whether Hsu
is required to turn in a progress report for the work of the past
quarter. Morse reported that OER requested a proposal for next
year's program. He will consult with the Whirlwind staff to see
what is needed.

The rest of the meeting was taken up with the discussion
of the assignments of the research assistants to training in the
various machines. Questions discussed were matters of tine per
week assigned to machine work and the balance between this work and
this assistance, class work and problem assignment. Morse is to
consult with Verzuh concerning the present scheduling for work with
the differential analyzer. All eleven assistants (list attached)
have now reported and are at work.

It was decided that meetings for this term would commence
at 1:30 on Wednesdays. Accordingly, the next meeting will be next
WednesdayP October 10.
