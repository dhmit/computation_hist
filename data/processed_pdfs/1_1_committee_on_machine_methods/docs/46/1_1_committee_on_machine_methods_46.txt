Memo to: Dr. J. A. Stratton, Provost = sa

From: Professor P. HM. Morse, Chairman, Institute Committee
on Machine Computation and Numerical Analysis

Subject: Proposed Conference on Mathematical Tables

1. With the reduction of the activities of the
Bureau of Standards in the Numerical Analysis field, there
is left no organization with the responsibility of seeing
that numerical tables of new and useful functions, needed
in research and engineering, are computed, printed in a sat-
isfactory form and made available to the persons and organi-
zations needing them. The need is not for another large
organization, but some central group for planning and coordi-
nation, with some funds available to finance editing and
publication.

2. With the growing use of large, high-speed
computing wachines, there is a need for a re-evaluation of
the whole question of mathematical tables. It is not that
such tables are less needed; there are new ways of making
tables, and it may be that tables should be produced in a
different form now.

3. Consequently, there is an urgent need to call
together a small group of persons interested in tables of
functions, both producers and users, to consider these and
other questions and to make recommendations to some national
agency as to the steps this country should take so that the
United States should contribute its share in providing these
tools for science and technology.

Kk, The Rational Science Foundation has evidenced
an interest in this field and has invited a proposal for
such a conference and a request that the NSF provide the
conference financing.

5. Accordingly, it is proposed that the Institute
suggest to the Science Foundation that there be organized a
two-day Conference on Tables of Mathematical Functions, to
be held at the Institute sometime this summer, to be Jointly
sponsored by the Foundation and the Institute and to be
financed by the Foundation. This should be a working Con-
ference and as such should number not more than 25 members,
chosen from those mathematicians, computers, academic and
industrial scientists who are actively interested in tables
of functions, either as prcducers or users. The tentative
agenda would be:


v

2a

1. How are tables made?
2. What functions need to be tabulated?
3 What form should tables have?
o ay Shona this country do about producing
ables

It is suggested that the conference room in the Hayden Library
be used and that :rrangements be made to house the #Honfereces
together, if possible. Conclusions of the conference, and
whatever recoumendsaiions are arrived at, would be published
for presentation to the Science Foundation and to the Institute
and for distribution to other interested parties.

6. Thig conference can be planned and organized
by the Institute Committee on Machine Calculation and Numerical
Analysis, which has the following membership: |

Philip HM. Morse, Chairman, Professor of Physics

S. H. ’aldwell, Professor of Electrical Engireering
Herman Feshbach, Assaclate Professor of Physics

J. W. Forrester, Director, Project Whirlwind

F. B. Hildebrand, Associate Professor of Mathematics
J. A. Hrones, Professor of Mechanical Engineering
C. C. Lin, Professor of Mathematics

7. The budget required would be for travel and
subsistence expises of the participants and for the propara-
tion and publicitlon of the Report of the Conference. If we
assume that som: of the conferees come from Washington and
some from Califernia, we might expect an average fare plus
personal expences of about $180 a person. In addition, there
will be sore secretarial costs, publication costs and incl-
dentals, so the budget would appear to be as follows, for 25
participants:

Travel fare (average RT Jlli0)we-=mccecccoccce- £3,500

a
Expencea (average for 2 days, $l80)ec-ceco-- 1,000
Secretirial @id-cem—ccocrnncenccnncccncocas 200
Producing and distributing report
(100 rages, e8t.)--=-=rce—mcsccoccennccax 500
IncldensalBwemeecccrcccacnecnsonncncccceacee 200
Total 25,200

This would appear 0 be a reasonable figure. If the cost
turned out to be 1:33 (some participants might come at their
own or other expeinve), the excess cin be returned to the
Fouadation.

8. It i. proposed that (he National Sclence
Foundation be requisted to be co-s:onsor of such a conference


«B=

and to provide funds as per the estimated budget. We esti-
mate it will take about three months to organize the con-
ference after we are assured of the Foundation's support.

If such assurance can be forthcoming in the next month or
80, the conference could be held in June; if assurance comes
later, the conference could be held in September. Final
decision on dates would have to take into account the dates
of other conferences at the Institute.
