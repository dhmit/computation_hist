Dear Dr. Benson:

professor Caldwell of our Eleectrical Engineering Depart-
ment tells me that your plant is getting an IBM number 704 machine
this f2l1l and that there may be some free time on the machine at
first, which might be available for us to use for pure research
and/or education. Since there is some indication that IBM will
make a 704 available to us about fourteen months from now, we
would certainly welcome a chance to get acquainted with a 704
this year, so we could develop our sub-routines ahead of time.

I would be glad to see you here at Tech to talk this
over, if a visit here happens to be convenient., If it is, please

..eall my secretary, UN4-6900, extemsion 857, to arrange a time.

 

1f this is not convenient, Dr. Verzuh and Mr. Arden, of our stdft,
will be glad to come to Lynn sometime to see what arrangements can
be made.

Thank you for your offer of cooperation.

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse, Director
Computation Center
