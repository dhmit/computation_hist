These claims were:

1. In a stringless necklace, a chain comprising
a plurality of at least four bead members formed
of resilient synthetic plastic material haVing the
resilient properties of polyethylene, each pair
of adjacent bead members being connected to
each other by a ball and socket joint, a first of
each pair of said adjacent bead members haying
an extension in the form of a neck extending from
a surface thereof facing the other adjacent bead
member, said neck having a head adjacent the
outer end thereof, the facing surface of said other
adjacent bead member having a socket opening
for detachably receiving and retaining the head
of the first bead member, said socket opening
including a mouth which is of smaller cross
sectional area than the interior portion of said
socket opening, said head being larger in cross
sectional area than the mouth of said socket
opening whereby such head will not ordinarily
pass through the mouth of a socket opening but
due to theiresilience of said plastic material
may be forced therethrough with a snap action
to provide a relatively secure but easily dis-
connected junction between adjacent beads, said
head being smaller than the interior portion of
said socket opening and the neck on said bead
member in the region adjacent the head being
smaller in cross sectional area than said mouth
whereby to provide for freedom of play of the
neck in the socket opening and ﬂexibility in the
junction between each pair of adjacent bead mem-
here.

socket opening including a mouth which is of
smaller ‘cross sectional area than the interior
portion of said socket opening, said head being
larger in cross sectional area than the mouth of
said socket opening whereby such head will not
ordinarily pass through the mouth of a socket

material may be forced therethrough with a
snap action to provide a relatively secure but

a plurality of at least four bead members formed
of resilient synthetic plastic material having the

Since this application was to become a
publication, it was necessary for the ex»
aminer to determine where, in his opin»
ion, the disclosures of this patent would
be helpful to future searchers. The pat-
ent was issued in the Ornamental Form
subclass along with exhibits 2 and 3 and a
copy was placed in each of the subclasses
which provides for molded plasticarticles,
reptile figure toys, chain type jomts, bead
chains, and chain—type bracelets. These
subclasses were chosen because the ex-
aminer considered the joint or the con-
catenation features of this new reference
would be pertinent in future searches in—
volving the features classmed in these

subclasses.
