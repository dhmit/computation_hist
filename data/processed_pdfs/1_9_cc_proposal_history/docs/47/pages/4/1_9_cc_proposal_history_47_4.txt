A minimal installation is listed in Appendix B. This
would represent a contr

ibution, from IBM, of about §250,000 a

¥ear at commercial rates or a total gift of about a million dollars
they expect to amortize their machines in about 4 years) though

thelr actual donation would be considerably less than this if they
let us have a remodelled 701 (with magnetic core memory) which had

been turned in for a 704 or T05 by some company. .

IBM is very much interested in supporting research and
education in categories a, b and ¢ mentioned above, particularly
in category ¢. The Institute is, at present, in the forefront
in categories a and b and is rapidly drawing to the fore in cate-
gory ¢. Dr. Cuthbert Hurd, head of Research for IBM, in a conference
with Carl Floe and Phil Morse, has shown considerable interest in
our plans for education and research in all three categories. It

18 quite reasonable to expect them to contribute to our efforts in
this direction.
