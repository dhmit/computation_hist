PARrT I: TWO-DIMENSIONAL STUDIES
Validity of T wo-Dimensional Field Studies

Making measurements in sectional models of three-dimensional systems has
been a technique used in engineering for many years.®* Where the system is
uniform along the vertical axis, such measurements g1Ve very accurate results.
In many cases where such vertical uniformity does not exist, sectional studijes
still give surprisingly good results. ¢ Recently, sectional models of the human
body have been used to study the leads used in electrocardiograpliy and vector-
cardiography.5 6 [t is very much easier to make measurements In two dimen-
sions, and it is, therefore, important to determine to what extent such meas-
urements are of value.

To test this point with reference to the horizontal plane, measurements were
also made in a three-dimensional thorax model. As the outline of the ana-
tomical thorax cross section appeared to resemble an ellipse, an effort waT
made to draw the true ellipse that would most closely correspond to the actua

In FIGURE 13,

FIGURE 2 shows the distribution of potential around the boundary of the
homogeneous thorax section, with a dipole angle g8 of (°, The left-hand edge
of this graph corresponds to the center of the back of the thorax section. Dis-
tances from the Jeft edge to the center correspond to distances going from the
back around the right side of the chest to the front. Zero corresponds to the
mid-sternal line. Distances to the right on the graph go around the eft side
of the chest to the back, and the right-hand edge of FIGURE 2 again corresponds
to the back of the section. FIGURE 3 shows similar boundary distributions
taken in the deep tank at the leve] of the dipole center for the same horizontal
angle of the dipole, 8 = 0°. From top to bottom the curves are for angles of
the dipole with the horizontal plane (@) of 4-90° to —90°. Ty is seen that for
vertical dipole angles of +30°, 0° and —30° the shapes of the curves for the
boundary potentia] are very similar to the two-dimensional curves. As the
reference electrode was located at the bottom of the deep tank, these potentials
are similar to body potentials using the left leg as reference. Use of any other
reference point would merely cause an upward or downward deflection of the
entire curve without changing its shape (the amount of the shift depending on
