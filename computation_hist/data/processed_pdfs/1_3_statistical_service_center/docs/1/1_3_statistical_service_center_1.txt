ABSTRACT

A request for clarification of responsibility in the
future use of the RDA by the Inetmentation Laboratory.
Included are statements of. the Instrumentation labora-
tory need for RDA for at least two years to satisfy
obligations to government sponsors; a sunny of use
during the past two years and recommendations for
future usage. Appendices include details of usage and
fiscal charges for the past two years; a list of future
work to be done; a technical description of the calibre-
tion problem and copies of pertinent semi-ands.

Section 1:0 INTRODUCTION

This memorandum is addressed to you in the belief that your
current responsibilities include the EDA. I have taken the liberty of
sending copies to Prof. Floe, Prof. Horse, Dr. F. L. Foster, Mr. J. Little
and Er. F. Wetriss, with whom I have recently discussed the situation.
Several factors indicate that now is an appropriate time to ask for a
clarification of responsibility in the future use of the RDA. These
factors include Mr. Verzuh's desire to clarify his position, the resigns-
tion of Mrs. Hogan, veteran operator of the RDA, differences in opinion
on the charging for non-Instnmentation Laboratory usage, and the current
interest in the Statistical Services of Hr. Little and Mr. Watrissc

Section 2.0 RESPONSIBILITY]-

Instrumentation Laboratory members believe that they assumed
complete responsibility for RDA operation on October 1, 1950. This situa-
tion was the result of the Institute's decision to close down the RDA
permanently in June of 1950. Since the mstmontation Laboratory had
work requiring the analyzer which Dr. Draper felt obligated to carry on,
we assumed all costs. This included transferring 3 machinists, l techni-
cian, and the Chief Operator, Mrs. Hogan, to our Payroll; and purchasing

1 The following statement is extracted from the Provost's memo of January 1,
1951, establishing the Committee on Machine Methods of Computation: “This
year the Department of Aeronautical Engineering through the Instrumentation
Laboratory has assumed responsibility for the operation of the Differential
Analyzer."


ell machine shop stock and RDA spare parts (total cost 82970). We also
agreed to finish a vector table to couplets RDA obligations to another
Air Force contract. However, we have never handled all of the charges

to nonolnetrunentstion Laboratory users because of limited understanding
of our authority. Both Prof. Horse's Connittee on Computation and Mr.
Verznh have worked most cooperatively with us in making decisions, but

we have not pressed our views where honest differences of opinion existed.
The arm performance of our work has been so excellent. and Kr. Versuh has
worked so hard in our interest that it would hove been very unfair to have
done otherwise. However, there is still some confusion in our minds as to
the proper charging for non-Instrumentation Laboratory usage. Also, Hrs.
Hogan's resignation and Mr. Verzuh's possible shift of responsibility are
additional factors that make it necessary to understh the responsibility
clearly so that changes can be made as needed and approved by the proper
persons. Unclear separation between RDA and Statistical Services and con-
tinued use of the old Electrical Engineering Department account #2310 for
RDA would seem to be the basis for any differences of opinion that exist
on fiscal matters.

Section 2:0 INSTHJMENTATION LABORATORY @52st FOB. RDA

Celibration for new ammnitions and tactics of sigxts designed by
Dr. Draper and now in service require use of the RDA. In addition, our
current contract calls for development of improved sights, and the solution
of the kinuatic equations involved require use of RDA.

The machine is unique in its demonstrated capability, and all
proposed alternatives have either failed to handle the problem or are yet
to be demonstrated. Past efforts have been made with Harvard's Computation
Laboratory; current efforts are attempting to apply Whirlwind to the problem.
Instrumentation Laboratory is devoting the effort of two full-time engineers
to devising and testing other machine methods.

In the meantime, we feel that in order to execute our current
obligations, we must have the continued use of the RDA. In the absence of
a definite proven alternate, we are very anxious to be assured of the use
of the analyzer for at least two years. It is further suggested that the
situation be reviewed at the end of the year, at which time more infomation
on alternate methods should be available. Appendix G contains a more detailed
description of the technical phases of the calibration problem.

Section .0 RECOMNMDATIONS FOR FUTURE. USE
l. Reassign primary responsibility to the Instrumentation Laboratory.
2. Have Mr. P. Cusick approve fiscal arrangements for non—Instrumenta-
tion Laboratory work. Proper billing can be handled very simply..

All Instrumentation Laboratory persons are now charged to DIG #63h6
and allocated out at the end of the month, according to information


~3-

eupplied on each tine sheet. Tile sheet statements regarding
non-Instronntnien Laboratory unge could be used by our budget
section as the basis for billing other users. Our mthority for
such charges would cone from purchase orders submitted to either
our project or DIG.

3. Continue the current arrangement or having Prof. three advise us
on the types of non-Instm-entation Laboratory work, which should
be perfumed on RDA from a technical standpoint.

1.. Contime present practice of having all RDA personnel comidered
an Instrumentation Laboratory responsibility. Thus, Inetments-
tion Laboratory is clearly responsible for assigning these people
to other work if the analyzer is temporarily or permanently shut
damn-

Section E30 3mm 0!" RDA USE

The following is a brief summary of the usage and fiscal arrange-
ments given in more detail in Appendix A and B for the period frol- October 1,
1950 - October 1, 1952:

Percentage of Estimated Cost
__.T20_.. %

Instrumentation Lab. usage 55% $50,000 *

Non-Instrumentation Lab. usage 33% 8,700 *
(charges reimbursed)

Non-Instrumentation Lab. usage 12% 0

(free usage for Institute
academic activity)

* Estimates include overhead at 1.2%

During this period, the RDA has been used in connection with three
doctorate theses, totaling nearly four months of RDA time. Dr. Seaman's
thesis is listed as part of the Instnmentation laboratory work while
Dr. Tung's thesis is included in the time of the Mechanical Engineering
Dept. This thesis work, plus the time given to Institute departments, shade
that 25% or more of the RDA operation has been in fundamental research. The
charges to other DIC projects are satisfactory but the credits on work out-
side of MIT have seemed too law. For 57.5 days work for Stevens Institute,
Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratory, Bendix and the U of Pa., we have
received a credit of approximately $2375. This figure plus overhead amounts
to 33375, which is far less than the $7500 that we would have charged these
companies under DIC policy. Of this 57500, $1500 would have been for the
industrial fund.

Section 6.0 CONCLUSIONS

As this memorandum indicates, we are currently dependent on the use
of both the RDA and Statistical Services for solving our calibration problems.

I hope you will find it possible to ellow us to use the analyzer for at
least two years and that the fiscal arranguents suggested will be satis-
factory. To correct any possible false impressions, I would like to re-
emphasize the excellent cooperation of both Kr. Verzuh and Prof. Horse's
Committee. In general, we have been very happy in our use of the analyzer.

Our concern for clarifying responsibility and ﬁxture use took a sharp up-
turn when Dr. Stratton mentioned a few weeks ago that the Institute was
considering giving the machine to the University of Texas , presumany
because we did not wish to continue supporting it. This was clearly a
misunderstanding. and we are anxious to avoid repetition 01' this type of
concern.

APPENDIX I!
SWEAR! OF FISCAL cum

It has been our desire to operate the EDA for others on a non-
loss, no-gsin basis. To do this requires a. credit of $100 .. SRO/day
for other work. We have also agreed to give up to 10% total time on thesis
or academic work free. The following is a summary of actual credits and
charges for non-Instrumentation Laboratory use:

1. Daring the period July 1950 - September 1950, we paid RDA
account no. 23h? $1732.15, based on the old method of charging,
even though we were paying two engineers and three machinists
for operation during this period. I believe that the proper
charge should have been about $815. This estimate is based on
the time of Hrs. Hogan, Kr. Gone, and one third of the tins of
Mr. Versuh and Miss Tom for one month - we used the machine
21.5 days. ‘ -

2. Since October 1951, Stevens Institute of Technoloy has used the
machine a total of 36.5 days. I believe a credit of approximately
“.000 should have been made to DIG 6783 (LL. Air Force account
umber for RDA). Up until now, we have been credited with only
$2610. Another point is that billed at 1005 industrial overhead
rote, the charge to Stevens would have contributed about $1500
to the Industrial fund.

3. Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratory
13 days of work done in January to March 1951
Desired credit $1500; actual credit £330.

4. Mechanical Engineering Dept. (Prof. Kaye and Dr. Tong)
314, days - August - November 1951
Desired charge about $3700; actual credit $2610
This difficulty was our own fau1t. We received some free corr-
sultation from Prof. Kaye and the remainder was considered a
contribution to Dr. Tung's thesis.

5- Project Meteor
27 days - July - August 1950 - correctly charged by Instrumentation
Lab. requesting DIC to transfer all salaries and wages for this
month to Meteor.
Credit $2008.53 plus 1.2% (32850)

39 days - August - September 1952 - charges now in process of
clarification. No difficulty anticipated.

Ber-rice; :ro currently perform a large volume of work for the Instrumerp

hire-raft ‘ 'ts. To clarify our present and anticipated future needs for

them; scr’vi'ies, I present herewith a resume of the nature of the calibration
probllm rm" the contributing role or these groups.

 

 

 

in our type of sight there are several variable parameters (2.3.
torques, currents} that must be functionally related, automatically and
continuously, to such measureable variables as the range of the target and
its time rate of change, the air density, and the aircraft angular velocity.

Hue procese of deriving the necessary relationships in a practical form is
called calibration.

The first step in calibration is to comaute the ideal fighter
flight paths which are such that a round fired at any instant along the
path is theoretically a. hit. Since the projectile is aimed by pointing the
aircraft itself, these equations necessarily involve aircraft dynamics. The
result is a complicated set of non-linear differential equations :ontaining
aircraft performance, ballistics of the projectile, and rather intricate
geometric and kinematic calculations. The solution to these is currently
carried out by RDA. The second step is the reduction of these solutions to
usable form; i.e., the preparation of tabulations of the sight parameters to
be calibrated against the variables to be used in their calibration. This
step involves quite complex kinematic calculations that are currently,r
carried out on punched card equipment by MIT Statistical Services. The
last step is that of finding suitable empirical approximations to these data
in a form that can be instrumented. Since the data depend upon many more
parameters that can be utilized in practice, engineering judgment and ex-
perience are the important factors in selecting the proper form for these
approximations. This part of the task involves relatively little computation,
and is carried out in the Instrumentation Laboratory.

The first two parts or this task are suited, in principle, to
solution by a large seal—2 digit-.11 computing facility, and a program is in
progress to explore the feasibility of a completely digital a; proach. The
import-ant and unknown factors are those of speed, accuracy, machine capacity,
and cost, as well as machine availability. Relief from our present dependence
unon RDA and Statistical Services can be expected, if at all, only after
completion of a major exploratory program with other facilities.
