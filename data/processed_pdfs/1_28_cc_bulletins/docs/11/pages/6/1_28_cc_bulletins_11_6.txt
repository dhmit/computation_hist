New Request Cards

New request cards are now at the printers and are expected
to be in use at the Center shortly, |

Identification of Program Decks

When submitting several runs under the same problem number,
simultaneously, you should identify the various decks, preferably
by punching "Deck n" in the comment field of the I.D. card and
then writing this number on the Request Card for that deck,
This will help the Dispatcher and the operators if it is
necessary to re-run one of the several jobs after the decks
and the Request Cards have been separated,

Extra Working Space

For your convenience, it has been decided to open
Room 26-168, the lecture room, as an extra programming area
when it is not reserved for other uses, Check the schedule
posted on the door and feel free to use the room if it is

available, Please try and keep the room neat since it is a
very difficult area to clean up.
