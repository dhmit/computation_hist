Dear Jack;

Our Whirlwind research program for the
1111‘ Renato:- haa struck pay dirt, and as usually
heppene, we need to extend our calculations in
order to preoent a entiafaotory hazards evalua-
tion to the Atomic Energy Commission. The treme-
ient etudies we are doing can be extended edeily,
but we need machine time in order to do this.

Accordingly, I would like to requeat that
twenty ham-e of time on Whirlwind. be assigned to
problem 266 for the coming term.

Very truly yours ,

'l‘ . Cantwell
