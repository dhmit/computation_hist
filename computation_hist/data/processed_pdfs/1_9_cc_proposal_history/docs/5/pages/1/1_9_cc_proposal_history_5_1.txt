Dear Professor Morse:

I am delaying accepting the research
associateship offer until I get a chance to
talk to you. The amount of work involved in
writing reports seems to be more than 1 care
to take on - if the provisions of the offer
are taken too literally. I assume that my
expenses while teaching in the T70L school would
be taken care of separately from the travel ex-
penses connected with the associateship.

I hope to see you about August 20,
although I may get down to M. I. T. for a

visit before then.
Best regards,

Gihon
