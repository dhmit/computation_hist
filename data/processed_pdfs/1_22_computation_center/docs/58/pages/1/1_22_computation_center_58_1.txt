Dear Phil.:

I have been invited to speak at a General Session of the
Anmual lMeeting of the ASEE this June on the subject of Engineer-
ing Science Facilities. In this connection it occurred to me
that I might illustrate the facility needs for Engineering Sciences
with some outstanding examples that I know., I immediately though
of your computer facility. Would it be possible for you to send
me a slide, or a print from which a slide could be made of this
facility, and a slide or a print of the most significant engineering-
science result you have achieved to date with it. With respect to
the latter, I would like to have a brief descriptive paragraph, in-
cluding specific data related to the photograph.

My primary purpose is to confront engineering scientists with
the needs for research facilities on the frontiers of science. I
would certainly be greatly indebted to you for any assistance you can
give me along this line, It will be helpful to me if I can have the
material as soon as possible,

Sincerely,
Raymond J. Seeger
Assistant Director (Acting)
