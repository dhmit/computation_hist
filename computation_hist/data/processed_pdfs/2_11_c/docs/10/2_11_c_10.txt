Dear John:

The purpose of this letter is to confirm what I told you
orally on December 10 in Washington conecerning MIT's participating
in the proposed Zurich meeting on automatic programming languages,

We are very much interested in participating in this program.
As 1 told you, we were somewhat uncertain as to the person we should
send to the meeting to best represent our interests. We are considering
one of the three individuals: Dean Arden, Sheldon Best, and myself;
however, we must select a man that will do the most good as far as this
program is concerned, We do have a financial problem and would be very
much intemsted in learning whether any financial assistance will be
available to help defray the cost of sending one man to this meeting,

In view of the discussions at the meeting in Washington on
December 10, we are very much interested in learning of the date and
place of the preliminary U.S, meetings which will be held prior to the
trip to Europe, Please let us know of your plans concerning this meeting,
in order that we may make necessary arrangements to attend. Furthermore,
we would be interested in knowing whether the date for the Zurich meeting
has been set -- as I informed you, the midterm vacation period at MIT is
as follows: January 27-31 ~ examinations; February 1-9 - vacation, This
allows us the requisite week to ten days required for such a meeting --
assuming this time is acceptable to other colleges.
