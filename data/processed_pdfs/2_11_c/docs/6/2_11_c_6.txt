Dr, Â¥. C, Leone

Case Institute of Technology
University Circle
Cleveland 6, Ohio

Dear Dr, Leone:

3 Asn I am returning your questionnaire on free machine time, as
it does not seem to be applicable in our case, The IBM 704 installed
here at the Institute is Primarily for the Universities of New England
and is not available for work originating elsewhere or for industrial

 

or military work,

I think probably the background of the organization here

: and the arrangements under which it works can most easily be obtained
| from our first progress report rather than trying to answer the
questions in your questionnaire, Accordingly, I am sending you, under
separate oover, a copy of our progress report.

Very truly yours

Philip M. Morse
