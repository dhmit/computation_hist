Subject: Summary of 709 Computer Usage During the
15-Week Pericd, September 15 through
December 31, 1960 '

In this last operating period, the 709 computer at the Computation Center
was used by persons from 15 of MIT's 20 departments and three of the interdepart-
mental laboratories not counting itself. The only school not represented among
its users was the School of Architecture and Planning. In all, 190 different
problems originating at MIT used 435 hours of computer time. In addition, 81
problems from other New England Universities used 141 hours.

The number of MIT courses which now make use of the 709 imn at least part
of their lab work has increased to 14 and this usage represents 17% of the
available coumputer time. Table III of this report and its accompanying charts
shows that theses are also an important source of work and, in particular, theses
on the doctoral level alone amownt to 20% of the computer usage.

DESCRIPTION OF TABLES

The following tables classify and summarize the computer usage during the

period September 15 through December 31, 1960. The specific breakdown is as
follows,

Table I, Usage by academic status of applicant (problem originator)
Table II, Usage by source of support

Table III, Usage by primary purpose
In addition, Table IV breaks down the use of the 709 by IBM on its shift.

(These four tables present & revision of the classification used in reporting
704 computer usage. The principal difference is the division of the previously
reported Table II which classified by applicant and arez of activity into tables
reporting academic status of applicant - Table I - and primary purpose - Table IXI.)

Reporting is of monthly totals and, as usual, MIT and the cooperating
New England Universities are presented separately.
