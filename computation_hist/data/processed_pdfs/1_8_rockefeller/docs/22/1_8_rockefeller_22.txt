Dear Mr. Buchanan:

I enclose an application for a Eran of $36, 000 a year
- for three years to help support a research staff, so that the

Computation Center at MIT can explore new ways whereby high-speed
computing equipment can be utilized in social science. Directions
for initial research are indicated, though details cannot be given
before work is started. A tentative budget and description of the
computing equipment are appended, together with an outline of the

arrangements for cther New England colleges to participate in use
of the equipment.

I have talked this gpplication over with Dr. Carl F. Floe,
Assistant Chancellor of MIT, and i{ has his approval. Please let |
me know if you wish more information.

Sincerely yours,

Philip M. Morse, Director
