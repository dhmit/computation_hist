6. Alternative form of the reduction theorem. e have shown that
every .basis is equivalent under change of basis to a reduced basis. Tt is ng
loss of generality to assume that the change of basis involves a matrix of
determinant + 1 (as all basis vectors can be multiplied by — 1 without
affecting the definition of reduction). Likewise we may assume by (4.21)
that B., B., Bs are S, P, Q respectively. Finally we divide each 2; by a
constant so as to put the lattice in inhomogeneo'us form, whence by; =1.
Then calling ba = &, bai =i We obtain the following result:

Let three non-collinear points (&,mi) of the projectwe (&n)-plane be
given in some fized order. It is possible to find an integral unimodular trans-
formation such that the points (&, mi) simultaneously go into the points (&4, 1),

Note that in order to cope with our previous lattice restriction (that no

regions to the projective plane, thus permitting division by zero.

7. Cyclic basis. A very important type of lattice is one with a cyclic
basis,
({1 bij = ax, where k=1 -+ j (mod 3) (k=1,2,3).
In this case the ternary form ®, as a function of the m;, is invariant under
cyclic permutations, and conversely. Here the basis B, (j =1, 2, 3), (in the

notation of 4) is reduced if and only if, of the four quantities @, @, %s;
— (o + a, + @;), two are positive and two are negative,

(or &yaa0s (g 4 o, + ;) < 0).

 

A PERIODIC ALGORITHM FOR CUBIC FORMS 827

now single out the “har »
We g hard case, where, under g change

. o o f . .
and (possibly) a change in sign of all a;, we have the inequalities of indices

(7.2) Gt > a> 0> >0,

Then, except for the hard case just cited, the cyclic basis will be finitel
close to a reduced basis wn the sense that the vector ;

) s P? Q) R; S 0 t
reduced basis can be chosen from among the 26 vectors + B; +Bf :- ge
+ By = B, &= B;, (15%57). » = by + By,

The above statement can be easily verified. We further note that the
hard case must be separated since the three numbers a1, %, @3 can otherwise be
arbitrarily close to one another and still satisfy the conditions (7.2). There-
fore, even 1f the set of 26 vectors above were extended to any finite set
however large, of the type k;B, 4 I;B, + m;B,, it would still be possible’:
to choose the o; so that of the four desired basis vectors P, Q, R, 8, the
one (S) which is in the all 4 (or all —) octant would be the one for
which k; + I; + m; %0, while the other three vectors would be such that
kj -+ 1y + m; =0, contradicting condition (4.21).

Fortunately, in many applications, the hard case simply does not occur.
For instance, for later reference, take

(7.3) o = 2, exp(2mim/p), (k=1,2,3),
where p (=1mod 3) is a prime and m through a complete set of residues
of cubic character indicated by k. Here a, + @, + o3 = —1, and therefore

if the o; were all of one sign (as in (7.2)), we should have | ez, | = 1/27
in contradiction to the fact that « is an algebraic integer. Hence the lattice
given by (7.1) and (7. 3), (determined by contraction of a cyclotomic field),
has a reduced basis very close to the cyclic basis described here.

Finiteness.

8. Norms and discriminants. We now consider the case where the
21, &2, T3 components in (4. 42) are the conjugates of three numbers spanning
a (totally real) cubic field. We shall show that although the neighbor process,
for instance, produces a chain of 3 X 4 matrices (see 12 below), they are
strictly proportional to only a finite number of classes. Thus the ternary and
quaternary forms take on only a finite number of values.

As a preliminary step, multiply through the matrices so as to make all
of the pi, qi, i, s; algebraic integers. We let A represent the (commjon)
absolute value of the determinants formed by omitting any one of the four
