Now that the IBM 704 is actually in the Compton Laboratory Building,
it should not be too long before it will be installed and rumning, We esti-
mate now that it should be operative by May 1 and can hope it will be
working a bit before that, It probably will be formally turned over to
MIT by Mr, T, J, Watson, Jr, of IBM on Alumni Day, June 10, But it might
be appropriate, desirable and pleasant to have an informal preview of
the Center and its equipment for those most interested 1n its use about
the middle of HMay. We would like to have you and three or four of your
colleagues to be our guests at the Center for a day about that time, to
see the equipment in operation (we hopel), to hear some of our plans and
to discuss your ideas for its most effective uss by all of us,

Sessions would start at 10:30 AM and run until about 3 PM, with
arrangements for lunch, so most of you can drive in and back, Within the
next two weeks, please fill out and return to me the appended page, letting
me know which proposed date would be desirable, and which of your colleagues
you desired to have accompany you, We will notify you later as to the
exact time and agenda,
