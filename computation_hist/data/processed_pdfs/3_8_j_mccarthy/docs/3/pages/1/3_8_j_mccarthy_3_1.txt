They help with the more attractive problems

announcement lists opportunities for work on:

a. Compilers

b. Artificial Intelligenece
c. oSimulation Studies

d. Numerical Analysis

e. Pattern recognition

Seminars in suitable topics are held.
It is advertised that fellows will

a. gain experience on new types of
problems,

b. meet other expert programmers
from other places,

c. participate in the development of
a programming theory.

Probably it will not be necessary to have a degree
