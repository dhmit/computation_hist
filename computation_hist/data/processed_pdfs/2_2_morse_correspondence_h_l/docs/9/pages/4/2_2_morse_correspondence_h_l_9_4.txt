This call was made on Friday afterncon with Mr. J. T. Flynan, IBM Bangor.
The above named Professors were met in a group. Dean W. 8. Evans has
replaced former Dean Ashly S. Campbell. Apparently, very little informa-
tion has gotten to the department heads although literature concerning all
~activities of the Computation Center was mailed to Dean Campbell. The
people with whom 1 talked knew very little about the Computation Center.
They all showed a great deal of interest and inasmuch as a graduate
program is offered at University of Maine, I feel sure that a great deal of
activity in the computing field is warranted. Dean Evans asked about getting
people trained. They have just missed the regular annual class at MIT.

I told him we could undoubtedly arrange to get some one {from Maine
University earolled in a cour se (I was thinking of a course for customers by
IBM) here in Boston. Another possibility was discussed - that of sendin

an instructor to Maine for two weeks provided a large group (20 or more)
was interested in taking the course. :

Dean Evans was also interested in details about the IBM Assistantship
program. All these things have been sent to the University but evidently
did not get disseminated. , =

We will send additional copies of the information on Research Assistants
to Dean Evans and I shall also send him a schedule of 704 classes to which
he may send a representative. |
