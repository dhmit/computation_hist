and [Owl—l). . .
We consider the general generating matrix A for this group and the corre-

sponding form time, y). From Part II it follows that a matrix exists of trace
equal to three times any Markoff number, a, (see §5), and With lower left-hand
element an = @(A)/6 = a/2, (compare equation (63)). Once we shall have
shown that the (non-zero) minimum of l<I>A l is @(A)/('), we shall have forms

analogous to Markoff’s forms.

11. Closure

Despite the fact that the matrices have fractional elements, we should still
want the forms tI>A(av, y) to be ultimately restricted to integral a and y so that the
“minimum” may have its usual meaning To begin with, however, we must let
(x, y) vary over a larger set, namely thcI lattice £2 consisting of all couples (x, y)
for which .1: + y and x — y are integers.

Consider the following parity-propcrly of a matrix A : The property is that the
rows on addition and subtraction yield integers of like parity, i.e., an + (121 and
an + ﬁzz are (integers) of like parity while a.“ — an and an —— (122 are also (in-
tegers) of like parity, (although the parities of these sums and differences will
not all necessarily agree). Now obviously Al", B“), C“), and E have this PTOP'

is so vast, (see [6]), that the ”one-sixth” property does not characterize these
forms at all.
