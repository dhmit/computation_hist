Dear Dean Sherwood:

Recently we wrote you about your interest in electronic computers
for scientific and engineering applications. To date we have not
received your answer and we are anxious to incorporate your thoughts
on this subject in our overall summary.

Of course, I realize that the amount of paper work that you receive
may have prevented you from taking care of this matter. Also, you may
have forwarded our questionnaire to someone else in your organization.

This is a follow-up reminder and we certainly would appreciate it if
you would send us a completed questionnaire. In case our previous
letter and questionnaire have been mislaid or delayed, we are attach-
ing another questionnaire to facilitate your reply.

May we hear from you soon?
Very truly yours,
ROYAL McBEE CORPORATION
