Deer Hr. Dunipace:

In accordance with your request of January 6. I have discussed
your problem request for "All: 704" with the Review Board on Wednesday,

Jnnusry 8 .

After considerable discussion, I regret to intern you that the

board again refused to approve your application for the following reasons:

1.

Your request does not reveal the significance or the results
at these computations to the field of aerodynamics --— what
is the significance of this work?

Your application indicates that you do not intend to publish
results of your work -— except to your employer. WAN}.

Your application does not substantiate the purpose of the
work concerning the calculus of variations approach. Do you

intend to use calculus variations? If so, how will this be
done?

Your request for machine tine fe— 65 hours -- is excessive in
View of the fact that we schedule only 30 hours per week for
the entire university usage.

The above specific comments are presented since you asked for a statement
concerning the Review Board objections.

As we discussed in our two meetings, we have a definite set 01’ rules

concerning application and use of the 704 -— occasioned by our operating
agreement with the IBM Corporation and other financing groups. I discussed
these with you in detail, and they are described in our progress reports and
