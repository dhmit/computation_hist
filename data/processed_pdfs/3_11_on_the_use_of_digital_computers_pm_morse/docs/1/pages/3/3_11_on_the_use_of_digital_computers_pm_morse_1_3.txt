are incapable of doing anything they are not told. And
they must be told in complete and exhausting detail.
When programming a calculation to be done by hand,
one can assume that the computer, even though not a
professional, will exercise a certain amount of judgment
at various points along the way, will make the proper
modifications if some number turns out to be negative
and will call for help if things seem to be going wrong.
To keep the programming simple, one often programs
the work in sections, carrying a long computation up to
an intermediate point, to see what the intermediate re-
sults are like, before deciding on the program details
for the next stage.

Such casual programming techniques will never do
for the really fast computers. The machine has to be
told exactly what to do at each step in the calculation;
what to do if the number turns out to be negative,
what to do if the number is larger than the storage
register it is supposed to fit into, not to go on com-
puting terms in a series if they are negligibly small,
not to try to divide by zero and so on and so on, in
complete and exhausting detail. The important thing to
remember in machine programming is that machine
computers are dumber than anybody.

The comforting technique of doing the work in sec-
tions, and pausing to decide what to do next turns out
to be quite inefficient because of the extreme disparity
in the times for computing and those used for pausing.
With hand computation it might take six hours to com-
plete one section of the calculations and then take a
half-hour to program the next step; with the machine
it might take six seconds to complete the calculations
and, because of the increased detail required, it might
take two hours to program the next step. One obviously
can’t keep the machine waiting for those two hours, so
the machine is switched to other problems and one has
to wait in line to get back on, after the next section is
programmed. If possible, therefore, it is best to pro-
gram a problem in one continuous unit, bringing out of
the machine only those final results which are neces-
sary to know in the end. Because of the present rela-
tive inefficiency in output equipment, the fewer the
numbers brought out of the machine, the quicker the
results will be available.

Thus is posed a dilemma which can annoy and frus-
trate the novice. The final, working program should
minimize the numbers brought out of the machine. But
if the program has an error in it, or has not allowed for
all possible alternatives at each step, the numbers com-
ing out of the machine will be inconsistent nonsense
and one must start “trouble-shooting”. Or, even worse,
the results may only be slightly inconsistent, and one
is not sure whether there is an error or not. And here
the lack of output details is a handicap, for one often
has to examine the intermediate results for a number of
trial computations before the programming error is
found—and these intermediate results have not been
brought out of the machine. There are, of course, so-
called “post-mortem” techniques for bringing the ma-
chine contents to light after a bad run, so the faulty

parts of the program can be diagnosed. And one soon
learns the tricks to be used to write a “clean” program,
one which is easy to diagnose and check. But it should
be evident that trouble shooting a complex program
can be as time consuming as trouble-shooting experi-
mental equipment often is.

At present, the writing of a program for a large com-
putational problem, checking it out and determining the
accuracy of the final answers, is the biggest bottleneck
of all in the use of the really fast computers. At MIT,
for example, we have adopted the rule of thumb that
any computation which can be completed by hand with
an expenditure of less than about three man-months of
time, and which won’t be repeated sooner than a year,
should 7ot be programmed for Whirlwind. We have
found by experience that the answers to such problems
can usually be obtained quicker by hand, because a new
program, for a tough problem, can easily take more
than three man-months to perfect.

This does not mean that one should turn big prob-
lems over to professional programmers to code, either.
Many of the critical details of the program can only be
effectively designed by someone who knows both the
problem and the techniques of programming. It is ad-
visable that the novice, who wishes to have a big prob-
lem solved by machine, should spend a couple of weeks
learning basic programming techniques, and then should
work out his first program together with an experienced
professional, who can help him avoid the usual pitfalls
and can suggest the use of already-tested subprograms
for part of the work. After this first experience the user
can carry on with only occasional help and advice, and
in a short time he usually prefers to do his own pro-
gramming. Several such amateurs, after a few practice
runs, have taught our professionals a trick or two.

As a matter of fact, after machine operation gets to
be more standardized and after we have gained more
experience in machine use, this programming bottleneck
should ease considerably. After all, from a general point
of view, a program is a kind of mathematical notation,
expressing, in symbolic form, the logical relationships
between various mathematical steps in the solution of
the problem. As with the usual mathematical symbols,
a poor notation can greatly hinder us, a good notation
can make it easy to work out the solution.

At present we are not very far along in developing
this new brand of notation for programming. The basic
symbols, such as addition, transfer to storage, and the
like, are built into the machine. The more complex ones
are collected in libraries of subroutines. When, for ex-
ample, someone works out a program for computing the
exponential function for any specified argument, or a
way to solve a five-by-five secular determinant, this pro-
gram can be written up, with comments and estimates
of error, and placed in a library of subroutines. Then,
if anyone else requires the value of an exponential, as
a part of his calculation, this subroutine can be in-
serted in his larger program. Eventually some of the
simpler and more popular subroutines can then be built
into the machine so that, for example, the code exp
