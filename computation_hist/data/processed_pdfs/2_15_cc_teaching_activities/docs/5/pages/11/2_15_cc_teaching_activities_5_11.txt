data. In addition to the solution as scientific computing and business
processing problems, a. number of. classroom lectures were devoted to the
consideration and evaluation of the relative merits of the many mercislly-
available electronic data processing systems. Specifically, this was achieved
by 3 Study of lG'reyresentntive intermediate-gene di'un computers, and seven
of the large-scale systeus -- BIZIAC, Datmtio 1000, EBA 1103, In: 704,

m 705: 38513013, and DRIVAC, respectively. Since many of the students were
entering various large business, industrial, and government concerns, it was
mortant that they have some knowledge at acne o! the relative merits of the
individual systene. Finally, several lectures were devoted to the Ial 704

It is apparent from the above list that the total attendance in these 11 subjects
was 768 students. This does not mean, however, that there were 763 individuals
involved since many of the students took a. number 02‘ the above subjects, thus the
actual number of individuals exposed to machine computation is considerably less.
