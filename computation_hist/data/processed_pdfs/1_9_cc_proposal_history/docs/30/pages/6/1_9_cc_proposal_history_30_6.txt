Aiternative Solutions - No single best recommendation can

made for satisfying our educational requirements for com-
puting equipment. Several alternative possibilities will be
mentioned, each of which merits further investigation, to
see which is possible and which would involve least finan-
cial burden to the Institute.

1. If the International Business Machine Corpora-
tion were willing to provide the Institute, rent-free, a
604, a CPC and a 7Ol calculator, in addition to the equip-
ment they are already donating, then the cost to the Insti-
tute would be only for the operating staff, which would be
from 8 to 12 persons, approximately the sige of the present
gtaff of Statistical Services. The same staff could operate
the additicnal IBM equipment used by the Registrar's and
Bursar's office. (The donated machines, of course, should
not be used for project or for administrative work.) TMis
golution would be the most compact and would be probably the
least costly. The equipment c¢ould all be located in the
space at present cccupnled by the Office of Statistical
Services, with a small (# bays) increase. In fact, all the
equipment except the 701 1s already here, though the
and CPC are now being used for DIC work. I®s feasibllity,
of course, depends entirely on the possibility that IBM ‘
wonld meke the equipment (plus their maintenance) available
rent-free; if rents would have To be pald, the cost would
pe entirely too large. >

2. 4if The IBN Corporation were not williang to donate
all the equipment mentioned in plan 1, but were willing to add
a CPC to The present donated equipment, we might be able to get
along without the 604, and would use Whirlwind I instead of the
IBM T01l. In this case we would have to add two maintenance
technicians, for Whirlwind, to the staff. This arrangement
would only be effective if we moved either Whirlwind or the IBM
equipment so they would be all in the same place and could be
run by the same staff. (Parénthetically, it would be wellnigh
impossible to move Whirlwind I from its present location without
considerable cost and delay.) In this alternative the CPC could
only be used for educational purposes, but a small part of Whirl-
wind time might be socld to DIC projects or to local industry to
help bear the cost. Such expedients are doubly dangerous, how-
ever, for the work would be competing with commeréial computing
outfits and would also be likely to crowd in on the educational
use of the equipment.

5. If the IBM Corporation is not willing to comn-
tribute any more equipment than the small amount they are at
present donating, then a possible solution would be to use
