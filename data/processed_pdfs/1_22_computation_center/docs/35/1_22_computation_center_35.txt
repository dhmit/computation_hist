Subject: Half-Word logic

The purpose of this memo is to inform you that the HIT-704 Computer
will have half-word logic installed during the period July 22-28, 1967. BSuc-
ceeding sections of this report contain the following informations

i, A list of half-vord logic instructions.
2. A brief description of the effect of balf-word logic on 704
commands,

The above list of half-word logic imstructions was prepared by Hr.
Thomas Apple of Applied Science Cambridge. From time to time there may be
additional modifications te this list. If and when whis information is
available, it will be as supplements to this memo ~- CC-29.

It should bo noted that there are only a limited number of 704
computers which possess this half-word logic. You are cautioned not to
write programs which you expect to put on other machines not having this
feature, (At the moment there are only two or three machines which have
half-word logic--MIT, Foughkeepsie, ete). You should therefore govern your
programing accordingly.

1. HALF-WORD IODGIC

Since helf-word arithmetic has been added te our 704, we felt it might

be wise to avoid confusion among tho programmers by explaining something of its
logic, sd

The general logic of half-word arithmetic is that tire address Y of the
~alf-word instruction will be affected according to bits in positions 16 or 17
a? the instruction, with a bit in 16 indicating left half of | and a bit in 17
indicating right half of ¥, The contents of the accumulator 1ill be affected
ony in positions 8, 1-17,

\ Ezemples (using symbolic coding) are now givem of {ie thirteen inptruc-
tions which ere changed by half-word arithmetic:

1) CEA Yy 52. cocienseccneas CACC) ave cleared, C(Y) 1.8-25 replace posi-
tions 8, 1-17 of ACC,

2. Effect of Half Word Logic on 704 Commands

thirteen 704 commands are changed by half? word logic. The
thirteen which arg affected are CLA, CLS, ADD, SUB, ADM, SBM, S70, DWP, DVR,
BPY, MPR, CAS, LDQ. : |

 

In general half word arithmetic Bay be summarized by the following
tabulation, according to the presence of bits in 16 or 17 of the instruction:

Item Bit 16 Bit 17
a) 0 0 704 operaticns as indicated in Manual except for STO

b) 1 0 Take 8, 1-17 from Bomory into SR positions 8, 1-17,
with SR positions 18-35 containing zerces and Proceed
to execute instruction in usual way,
8TO Take S, 1-17 of AC and put in 8, 1-17,

e) Dc Take 8, 18-35 from memory into SR positions 8, 1-17
with SR positions 18-35 conteining zeroes and proceed
as above.

S70 Take 8, 18-33 of AC and put in 8, 18-35,
éd) i i Hachine obtains logical "OR" of 8 by combiaing positions

1-17 and 18-35 from Renory into SR positions 8, 1-17,

There has been some confusica concerning the use of item de-
sionl taneous Presence of a ome in bits 16 and 17. The latest vord from Paugh-
Ecepsie (7/23/57) is that this operation does indeed berform properly and
provide the logical "OR" instruction. It should be moted, however, that om
the store instruction (STO) the 'OR"rezuls Sppears im both the right and left
hend portions of the accummlator,
