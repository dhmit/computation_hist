Dear Abe:

As the work on our 704 expands, we find it necessary to
help set up programs for a fair number of new and interesting
problems. This means that we are having to expand the programming
staff of the Computation Center here, and it cccurs to me that
you may know of Some younger person who would be interested in
such a position. We are not looking for someone who necessarily
has had a large experience in programming but are looking for
someone who has had a good background in mathematics (a bachelor's
or master's degree) and who 18 interested in computing machine
applications. The person who comes would have a chance to take
a course or sSo and could go to various seminars around the place.
If, for example, he wanted to eventually get a doctor's degree,
he could work at the Center for a year or so and then take a
part-time job while working for his degree.

We have a wide range of problems from those of language
translation to those of calculations of nuclear characteristics.
We do not code the usual problem which comes to us, so these
persons would be engaged mainly in the special and interesting

roblems and in writing out programs rather than detailed coding,
although there may be exceptions).

I would appreciate it if you could let me know of any
person who might be interested in taking such a position either
this spring or next summer, or in suggesting that such people
should write me directly. The salary we would offer would be
normal to universities, not as high as industrial positions, but
the man would have the opportunity of further class work and would
have contact with a wider variety of problems than in industry.

Singcerely,

Philip M. Morse
