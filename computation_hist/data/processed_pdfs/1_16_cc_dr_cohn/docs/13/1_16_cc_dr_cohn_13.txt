We shall develop a similar property which we shall call stability and we shall

extend it to a large class of lattices for star bodies. We shall do this by introducing

a formalism of positively dependent differentials. Then as an illustration, we shall

give a condition for stability of the norm in an algebraic module (a condition

which can be considerably simplified by the use of units in the Dedekind order [5]).

The applications that follow (see §9) will stem from the following result:

and
(5.31) [Fm®, 9] < |Fom®, ¥)| — 9/2 — ¢*|

for some index k depending on £ providing only that |2 — *| < e.

Conversely, if a lattice has these properties for some ¢, 7 and Q + 1 n-tuples
as described, then the lattice is stable.

This is the type of property that Mahler [7] established for certain cases
where his theory of “bounded reducibility”’ applies. The property is an easy
consequence of the definition of stability given above. As a simple corollary
we note that when £* is stable, then for some positive ¢, 7, and all 2 — e¥| <6
we have M(¥) < M(2*) — | — |,

Thus, in a sense, M(¥*) is a local maximum by virtue of the Q + 1 specific
lattice points for which the value is assumed.

0. Positive span. Now there are often infinitely many vectors of a lattic¢

satisfying condition (5.2) for stability. Hence it would seem precarious to expec

of the unit star, without coinciding in direction. Let us further suppose that the
last property still holds if we exclude from consideration all vectors of {v}
that lie in an arbitrary set of fixed hyperplanes (through the origin). Then
lhe set {V} has a subset that positively spans S° and hence a further subset of Q + 1
positively dependent vectors.

To see this, first note that the projection property is easy to obtain from the
unit star. To establish the independence property we select as our subset of
\V} the sequence of vectors chosen by the following inductive procedure:
The vectors are to come increasingly close to the 2Q vectors of the unit star in
“me order (without coinciding). Furthermore each vector is selected to be
nearly independent of the set consisting of earlier chosen vectors (if any)
gether with the 2Q vectors of the unit star. This process will at every step
leave cones about the vectors of the unit star inside one of which the next vector
Of the sequence may be chosen.

extension of Gauss’s criterion for reduction, 1.e., that one root and the negative
reciprocal of its conjugate lie between 0 and 1. Thus the lattice ¥, is critical.

If we turn our attention to the definite form ¢ = x," + x52 we find that ¢
is stable only for the critical (equilateral) lattice, in which case ¢ is proportional
under rotation, to the norm function of the integers in the field of the cube roots
of unity. For the larger problem of ¢ = x:2 +... + x,% analogous types of
extrema have been developed [6; 9; 2] manifesting themselves largely in the
coefficients of the expanded form. (The reader is referred to [2] for recent develop-
ments as well as a sizable bibliography.) The present paper, however, will
conclude with a treatment of the norm function of §7 as a factored form; thus we
shall finally arrive at a criterion of stability in terms of the multiplicative arith-
metic of a field.

9. Application of units of the order. The module I determines [5] another
(non-singular) module O, called its order, which consists of all algebraic integers
v (in the corresponding field) such that vit lies in IM. For instance, if IM were
the module of all integers in a field (called an integer-module for short), then we
should have © = IM and the minimizing x (or z) satisfying equations (7.1)
(or (7.2) would be the units. In any case, O is also a ring with unity, and
according to the classical theory it contains 7» + 5s — | fundamental units
We shall denote any unit by u (with conjugates #;). Thus for every solution X
(orz) to (7.1) (or (7.11)) another one is of the type xu (or zu). We shall now use

these units to make the vectors R follow a unit star. (See $6.)

As an immediate consequence of this criterion, the integer-module of a req!
quadratic field is stable if and only if there is a unit of norm —1. The integer-
module of a totally real cubic field is stable if and only if the units display all
possible 2% arrays of sign among their conjugates. For instance the totally real
cubic field generated by 2 cos 27/7 (of minimal discriminant = 49) easily has the
property, as we see by using as units conjugates of this generating element.
Hence the field in question is stable [7].

[n the case of modules which are not totally real it is harder to find a criterion
as elegant as the last one, because uu | = |tq/ 0, not only when j and / refer
to the same fields (respectively) as do p and g, but also when they refer to
conjugate complex fields. Thus it is not so easy to accentuate just one component
of R. But since we are interested in the real or imaginary components of u,/u,
(see (7.21)), we can make use of the incommensurability of = with the arguments
of certain complex units. Thus by a modification of the unit star method as
just used for the totally real case, we can see that all cubic fields that are not
oially real have integer-modules with stable norms. Mahler [7] gave an analogous
result only for the cubic field of (minimal) discriminant 23, but it curiously
enough requires no special properties of that field!

Concluding in a simpler vein, we can see that if an integer-module 1s not
totally real, but nevertheless has as units only totally real numbers (or even
bure imaginary numbers) then it can not be stable, as the number of distinct
10n-zero components in (7.21) will fall short of the desired total, Q = n(n i “
by at least s. Thus, once more, the complex quadratic fields do not Have ta =
Nteger-modules, except when the field is that of the cube roots ol unity.
