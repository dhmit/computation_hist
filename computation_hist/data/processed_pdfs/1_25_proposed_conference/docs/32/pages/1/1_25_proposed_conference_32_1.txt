Professor Philip M. Morse, Director
Computation Center - Room 26-146
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
77 Massachusetts Avenue

Cambridge 39, Massachusetts

Dear Professor Morse:

Professor Freiberger and Dr. Walker have asked me to send you
the enclosed information about the Conference of University Computing Center
Directors.

I am enclosing a list of University Digital Computer users, on
which we would like to have you either specify your order of preference or indi-
cate rules to be followed. We will then mark the amount of money each will re-
ceive (first-class air fare plus $36) and send out invitations to the limit of the
budget. As we receive word that participants cannot attend, or are asking for
less money than our budgeted amount, others will be invited.

I am also enclosing a draft of a letter to be sent to the participants,
over Professor Freiberger's signature. Please return the original, with any sug-
gested changes you may have.

If everything is in order, we expect to send out the invitations on
Monday, April twenty-fifth.

One of our staff members will be in Chicago on Friday and Saturday
of this week and will check on the physical arrangements at the Shoreland Hotel.

Sincerely yours,

3
