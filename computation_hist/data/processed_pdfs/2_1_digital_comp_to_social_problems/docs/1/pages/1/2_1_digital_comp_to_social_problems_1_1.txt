Opportunities and Needs

Environment and New Facilities - M.I.T. has long been in the fore-
front in the—EEVETEpment of computing equipment and in developing
ways whereby this equipment can help solve problems in a wide
variety of fields. In the mid-30's vannevar Bush built here the
first differential analyzer and several faculty members, in various
departments, used it to solve problems in engineering, mathematics,
and physics, which could not otherwise be solved. In the past
four years Whirlwind I, one of the first truly high-speed digital.‘
computers to get into operation, has been made available for more
than 1/3 of its time for the solution of general scientific prob-
lems. Problems from many fields, sponsored by members of all the
different departments at the Institute, have been put on the
machine. The programming research staff of Whirlwind has gained
experience in adapting the computer to this variety of problems

and the faculty at the Institute has begun to learn, by actual
doing, the ways in which the computer can help them solve their
problems.

Beginning in 1957, the computing facilities at M.I.T.
will be enlarged and reorganized into a Computation Center, to be
devoted entirely to unclassified scientific research and education.
I.B.M. is donating one of its new 70h computers with double the
usual storage units and with appropriate auxiliary equipment, and
will provide for the maintenance of the equipment; the Center will
be housed in the new K. T. Compton Laboratory Building according
to a reement with I.B.M., the equipment will be used ten hours a
day on the "midnight shift") by I.B.M., will be available up to
seven hours a day to faculty members from other colleges in New
England and the remainder of the time (seven plus hours) will be
available for use by students and staff of M.I.T. for basic re-
search. The programming research staff, at present working with
Whirlwind, will be transferred to the Center, to serve as a nucleus
for planning machine use and for developing new techniques of
machine application.

Nature of the Research - Exploitation to the full of the potenti-
alities of a new piece of equipment can most effectively be accom—
plished by an advance on two fronts: the solving of specific problems
and the development of techniques. In the case of computing machines,
research workers in many fields should learn machine programming
techniques and then proceed to use the machine to help them solve
their own problems. In many cases they can develop the programs

they will need for their work, but in some crucial cases they will
need the help of those persons interested primarily in machine
operation, who are interested more in developing machine techniques
than in solving individual problems.

This division of labor has been necessary in many other
scientific advances. The recent great progress in nuclear physics
