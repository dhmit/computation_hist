Dear Mr. Jortner: |
Professor Morse has forwarded to me your letter

requesting—information on the solution of fourth order
-biharmo

nic-type boundary value problems. I do not know anyone
who is solving such problems at present. However, it is
quite possible that one of the 500 problems now using machine
time does involve the solution of such problems.

If you could give me some more detailed information

~as to the source of Ws work, a further SDT

be possible.

ow I am enclosing a copy of the Cibetah tan Center's
semi-annual report which has rather extensive lists of the
work being done at the present time. This may be of help
in determining proper references.

Sincerely er

Dean N. Arden

Assistant Professor
