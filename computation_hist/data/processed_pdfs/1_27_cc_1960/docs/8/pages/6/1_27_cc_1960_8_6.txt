70h's capabilities. Dr. Ynavo has not as yet been hampered
seriously other than in the sense or slow programming pro-
gress due to the existence of the queue.

gzmbolic Manipulation (Artificial Intelligence Pro;ect-Dr's

Ms mmﬂ and Jo “acutgg
Dr's Minsky and McCarthy have developed a language for

dealing with logical and same type problems which as of yet
are primarily symbolic (as opposed to numeric) in character.
They are now engaged in applying this language to a large
class of problem solving situations, rcansins from chess to
the proof or theorums. One characteristic of such problems
is that they tend to require an exhaustive search through a
large number of possibilities.

The main hope in such problems is that the machinc can
either by itself or with on-line human assistance develop a
rule of thumb (or heuristic) to short out the exhaustive
search and trial procedure. This class or problems requires
very fast information processing, combined with as large a
random access memory as is possible to apply their tech—
niques to any sizeable problem clearly can require up to
weeks of 704 time.

Experimental Physics Data Reduction—Dr. D. Caldwell

Dr. Caldwell's work on determining the characteristics
of hyperons (Lambda, D, Pi, Mu, etc.) involves the detection
and computation of certain types of trajectories from among
10-ioo,ooo photographs or high bubble chamber tracks.

This problem not only involves a large amount of data,
but has strong requirements for the machine to recognize
characteristic patterns. This type or process (although once
the pattern is recognized the computation is small) can again
severely tax the 704 facilities.
