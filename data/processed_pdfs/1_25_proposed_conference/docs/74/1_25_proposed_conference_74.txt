Dear Walter:

I am back at last and I am rather busy at the
beginning of the school term, but I would be glad to see you
or hear from you soon regarding your sessions with Grad and
the latest dope on our planning committee. Drop me a line

or give my secretary a call to see about an appointment.

Yours,

Philip M. Morse
