COMMITTEE ON MACHINE METHODS OF COMPUTATION

Minutes of the Sixth Meeting
Academic Year '52—‘53

Persons Present: C. W. Adams, S. H. Caldwell, H. Feshback,
J. W° Forrester, C° C° Lin, P. M. Morse,
F. Verzuh

The meeting was almost completely devoted to a discussion
of the summer meeting of the Association for Computing Machines to
meet at the Institute on September 9 through ll, 1953. Mr. Adams
reported that I would be officially notified by the Association
Council and requested to start planning the program for the meeting.
He said there would be approximately 500 persons at the meeting.

 

The discussion concentrated on possible 5 'cial sessions
of invited papers which might be scheduled. One, to we planned and
run by Adams could be on program subroutine, which would be appro—
priate at this time and would be of definite interest to the
Whirlwind staff. Another appropriate special session would be on
numerical analysis. It was suggested that Professor Hildebrand

. could schedule and run this session.

Two other possibilities were sessions on analogue come
putors (perhaps run by Seifert) and one on punched cards (perhaps
run by Verzuh.)

Morse announced that he was writing to the departments,
in which the machine computation assistants are at present working,
asking these departments to indicate which of the assistants were
likely to continue next year in order that the Committee can estimate
how many openings for new assistantships are available. Morse
suggested that each of the interested departments should commence
consideration of other candidates for assistantships and suggested
that the first recommendations could be brought to the next meeting
of the Committee.

Next meeting will be at ;;c VP.M. on Wednesday; March 5.
