Computation Center whenever vou come. I am golng to be
rather busy during parts of December, and if I am unable
to see you when you first arrive, I suggest that you get
in touch with Professor Dean Arden who is in charge of
the programming research staff at the center.

Miss H1ll in my office in the Physics Department

or my office at the center can tell you how to get in toueh
with Professor Arden.

Sincerely,
