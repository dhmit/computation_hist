Dear Professor MHorse:

Sometime ago we received from;you an account of your plans for
& digital computing laboratory at your institution. It was sub=
mitted in anti√©ipatidn.of a program in the National Science Foundation
for the support bf university computing facilitiese. Since the
President's Budgelt contains an item for Facility Support by NSF4 you
may wish to consider submitting a proposal along the lines of your
earlier communication,

Although no assurance can be given at this time as to the avail-

ability of funds, you may be sure that, if funds are available, all

proposals will receive the most serious consideration.

Sincerely yours,
