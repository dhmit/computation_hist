Dear Arthur:

This is In the nature of a progress report concerning
a possible Conference of Directors of university computing
centers, about which I wrote you early last spring.

After I wrote you I wrote %o about a dozen directors
of the larger university centers aglting for thelr reactions
about a separate permanent organization for university computing
center directors. The answers I received were nearly unanimous,
They were not enthusiastic about another permanent organization
in the computer field. They agreed there are a number of probe
lems peculiar to university computing centers which ought to be
talked over in common from time to time. They wondered if
special meetings could be called about the time of an ACH or
Joint Computer Conference orp whether one or two single confer
ences would not accomplish what was needed. Several of the
letters mentioned specific problems of interest, much as the
problem of financing the computing center while still keeping
it avallable for students and faculty, alse the questions of
academic standards and the status of research on machines,

Last month I attended a conference called by IBM at
Poughltcepsie for the directors of university computing centers
using IBM equipment. About 20 of the 85nown directors of cole
lege computing centers were there, mostly directors of centers
having 650s. We had an evening scesion concerning this same
problem. There again, the feeling wos that 1t was premature to
tall about a permanent organization, However, I found a much
greater need for general dlscussion and mutual agrecment on
various mattars among thls group which represented the smaller
and newer computing centers rather than the representatives of
older and larger centers to whom I had written before. This
group felt the need of support for thelr plans and sugzestions
for wnat are wise and unwise means of financing and help in
determining procedures and academic standards. After an
evening's discussion we set up an informal planning group with

myself as chalrman, Professor Walter Freiberger of the Depart-
ment of Mathematics at Brown University as secretary, and cther
members as noted in the enclosed announcement. It was agreed
that some time in the next year or two it would be most helpful,
particularly for the smaller never centers, to have a confer
ence off two or three days on problems of particular interest +
