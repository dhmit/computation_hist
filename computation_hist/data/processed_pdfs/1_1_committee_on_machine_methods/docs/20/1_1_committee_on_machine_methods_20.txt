COMMITTEE ON MACHINE METHODS OF COMPUTIATION

nute of the Seco M
Academic Year 151-152

Persons Present: S. H. Caldwell, H. Feshbach, J. W. Forrester,
C. Lin, P. M. Morse, E. RBelssner

The first topic discussed was that of the courses which
it should be expected that the research assistants take. It was
generally agreed that a few courses in Mathematics, such as M39
and M351-352, be a minimum in Mathematics, and that the first
course given by Kopal and the courses by Adams and Caldwell be
desirable for the machine aspects of the problem. It was reported
that the present course of Adams conflicted with the schedules of
a great number of the present assistants, and there was some dis-
cussion as to how this might be avoided in the future.

Feshbach pointed out that it would be useful to have a
1ist of 211 the machines available at the Institute, together with
a short description of their capabilities. It was suggested that
Rubinow might make this list during the first term, and Feshbach
is to ask him whether this is possible. It is expected that mem-
bers of the Comuittee will help him so far as is possible.

Morse reported that the quarterly progress report was
in the stage of preparation, and that Hsu'!s contribution should
be turned in before the end of the week. Reissner is to see that
this is done. The situation on the program proposal for next
year, to be sent to ONR, is not yet clear, and Morse will report
next time on the results. |

Unless new items of importance come up in the ueantile,
the next meeting of the Committee will be Wednesday, the seventh

of November.
