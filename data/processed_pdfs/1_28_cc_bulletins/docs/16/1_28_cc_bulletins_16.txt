Subject: MI APLT - An Array PLoTing Routine

 

Purpoge: To display on the 740 CRT Recorder the spots represented by a
pair of arrays of rectangular coordinates stored in memory in
fioating~-point form.

Description: The maximum and minimum values given in the calling sequence
define the boundaries of the screen in the user's units, If
zero lies within the range in either direction, an axis is
displayed in that position. Given x and y values are
converted to raster values and them to coordinate display
words which are copied to the scope.

Method: A raster vslue Rx {or Ry) is computed by:
Rx = (x-x minimum) (x maximus-x sinimum)/1024.

Raster values greater than 1023 or less than 0 cause that point
to be ignored.

Usage: Calling sequence:
a TSX SCOPE 4

awl PZE X,,Y two locations
o%Z2 PZE n, , 8 two integers
cdFd DEC x maxicoam a floating point number
air4 DEC x minimum & floating point number
oS DEC y maximus a floating point number
F6 DEC vy minimum 2 floating point number
07 Return
where :
1) XZ and ¥ sre the locationz of the first value of the X and
the ¥ arrays respectively,
2) mn is the number of points to be plotted.
3) § is the number of storage registers separating consecutive
values of the arrays,
4) x maximum, x minieun, vy Zeximun end y =inimus specify the
saxisun and minimum values to be displayed in each direction,
{These values specify the values assigned to the edges of the
BCP , )
Storage: Reguires 75 registers plus seven registors of COMMON,
