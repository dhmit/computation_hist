Dear Professor Morse:

You were right!! - I did put my foot back into the trap
when I returned to TECH for that week.

I quess I missed you my last day. I wanted to stop by
and say "Good-bye." Anyhow since then, I have accepted a
temporary job as secretary to the International Rescue Committee
who has set up a Boston office for the Emergency Appeal for the
Hungarian People. It is quite an interesting and stimulating
place, but after the rush is over, I will be "on the road" again.

As I once told you, you spoiled me. I find I am very
fussy about the men who interview me. I have often thought of
your "suggestion" about the Computation Center. In fact, just
before I got this job, I was planning to come to see you to
see if you really meant it and what it would be like.

In the meantime, Mrs. Williams called me and told me,
or rather asked me, to think about a suggestion which came from
Professor Slater. His secretary will be getting married in
January, and he wondered if I were interested in working for
him.

I have been very flattered by the kindness of everyone
in the Department. However, before I make up my mind whether
I will come back to Tech and about Professor Slater's offer, 1
should very much like to talk to you. (If, of course, you would
want to talk to me.)

I am sorry to disturb you at home, but I want to keep
things quiet for a while. If at any time you want to contact
me, I shall be at LIberty 2-8191 during the day. Thank you.

Sincerely,
flossmary

P.S. Hope all the Morses had a pleasant Thanksgiving.
