Subject: The Relocatable Loader Pynched by FORTRAN

This description of the loader punched at the front
of all binary decks which FORTRAN produces may be useful to
people who wish to modify a FORTRAN-produced program by read-
ing in their own binary modifications. No description of this
loader has been distributed through SHARE, and the conclusions
stated below were arrived at through a study of the binary cards
and checked by a simple experiment on the 704,

It loads both absolute(l) and relocatable binary tEy
formation cards, but does not use th ?tandard origin card .
It does not load correction-transfer'l) cards,

It is 4 cards long and occupies locations O through
137 octal.

If 1t encounters any normal self-loading card, it
performs a load-card sequence.

FORTRAN Storage Map

The storage map normally shows the actual machine
location of variables, but does not show the machine location
of the program. The program is punched on relocafi?le binary
cards, and the storage mwap tells only the nominal location
of a given statement. Normally, one needs to add 140(octal)
to this value to get the actual machine location. : |

Relocatable Cards

The action of this loader when loading relocatable
information cards can be explained by considering how one could
