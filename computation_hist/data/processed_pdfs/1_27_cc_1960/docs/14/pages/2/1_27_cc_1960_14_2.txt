between the COMIT system and other small programs.
The COMIT system has been decoupled from any particular

operating system (e.g. Automatic Operator Program) and may be used
as a separate system itself. The current modes of use and initiation
include:

1) Call from on-line card reader for compilation

and/or interpretation
2) Call from tape for compilations and/hr interpretation
3) Call from within the MIT Automatic Operator Program

for compilation and/or interpretation.

A programmer's reference manual is forthcoming which includes

details of system operation and operating instructions for machine

operators.
