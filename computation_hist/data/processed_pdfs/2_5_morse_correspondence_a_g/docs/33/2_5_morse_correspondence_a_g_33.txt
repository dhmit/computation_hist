Dear Dr. Morse,

I enclose a first draft of a paper. "Electronic k’omputers
and Research in the Social Sciences" which I am preparing
for the Social Science Research Council. This is the pro—
ject Pen Herring told you about early this year. I should
like to have your reaction to the kind of material that
will go into this paper.

 

I will shortly be in touch with Frederick Mosteller to
arrange to spend a day in Boston to obtain his opinions

I shall call you as soon as a date is under consideratiom
to see if I can take advantage of your kind offer to dis—
cuss computers with you.

Sincerely.

WNW

Ezra Glaser
