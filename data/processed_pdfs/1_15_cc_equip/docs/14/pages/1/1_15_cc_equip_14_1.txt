Mr. P. V. Cusick
Room 4-110
N, 3. T.

Dear Paul:

In accordance with your recent request, I have prepared a memo
CC-10 which lists the office equipment requirements for the MIT Computation
Center. This list in a sense is not complete since it does not list all of
of the equipment in the 704 room and the 650 and EAM areas. However, since
IBM has agred to bear all of these costs, we are not too concerned. An
examination of the contract with IBM indicates that they would furnish the
equipment in the following areas:

la. NE university-IBM Research Assistants Room 158, 157

1b. MIT-IBM Research Assistants Room 161, 163, 165, 167, 169
2. IBM Institutional Representative Room 147, 151

3. 704 Machine Cperator Room 145

4. 704 Schedule and Pispatch Area Room 148, 150

5. 704 Reception Area Room 152

6. Dark Room Room Â©GHA

7. EAM Area Room 058

8. IBM Customer Engineering Room 166

However, I should mention that in some of our informal discussions
with Peyson Hunter it was indicated that perhaps the Computation Center
Headquarters and a few other areas might be serviced by IBM for compatibility
reasons -- from the aesthetic office appearance viewpoint. Prof. Morse and
I thought that we might consider asking IBM to furnish the entire first floor
in addition to their commitments to furnish the Dark Room and EAM area in the
basement.
