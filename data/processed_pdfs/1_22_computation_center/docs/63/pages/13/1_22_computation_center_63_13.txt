The MIT Computation Center has been rccently established

for the purpose of promoting academic research in the
New England area with modern electronio.digital computing
machines, As such the Center will maké available to mest
New England Colleges research facilities which have been
heretofore dénied because of the large’financial and staff
obligations required for modern comput;r operation. ToO
implement the operation of the Center,ithe IBM Corporation
is installing a high-speed model 704 cbmputer along with an
extensive set of peripheral machines fequired for proper u
usage., These machines will be oparatea by the Center and
will be at its disposal(with the exception of one~third of
the 704 computing time which has beethemporarily retained
" by the IBM Corporation because of the current shortage of
computing facilities). The remaining i’.ﬁo-thirds of the
704 computing time will be evenly divided between research
at MIT and research at the remaining ﬁew England Colleges.
In addition to the cost-free use of the 704 computer, the
IBM Corporation will provide machine maintenance personel
and will %inan¢;§;1y466ﬁ£;igﬁﬁe towards the support of
about a dozen technicians required for the effective
operation of the computer. The latter will include tox
