Dear Professor Freiberger:

————

I was interested to hear of the poseibility that the
proposed meeting of computer center representatives
might be scheduled to be concurrent with the A. M, S.
meeting at the University of Chicago next April. If
80, I would be very glad to handle the task of ar-
ranging facilities, and for that matter, whatever
aspects of local arrangements might be required. I
see no reason why there should be any difficulty in

providing good facilities here for the proposed meeting.

Sincerely yours,

(lox Oto
