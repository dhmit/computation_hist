checker-playing program we had hoped to put on for you. will
have to be postponed. The Center quarters will be open for
your inspection between 10.15 am. and 12.00, there wil1 be
a. stand—up lunch served in the Conference Room on the first
floor at the end of the building at 12.00, and there will be
a discussion of the program of the Center in Room 6-120
(Main Building, East side, first floor) from 1.00 to 3.30.

From 10.15 to 11.30, in the 701: Ron, Frank Verzuh
will describe the equipment. Between 10.15 and 10.115 and
between 11.30 and 12.00 several members of the Center staff
(list appended) will be in the 704 Room, and will be pre-
pared to answer various questions concerning the equipment,
procedures for using it and our plans for research. Each
member will be glad to answer general questions, but each

you look up the appropriate person. Each is wearing a
