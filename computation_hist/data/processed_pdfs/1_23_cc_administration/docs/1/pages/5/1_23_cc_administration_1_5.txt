Budge t~ Development work of the sort described can be

continued indefinitely, of course, but the first results of the
orogram will provide the greatest benefits in making the machine
more versatile and easy to use. Intensification of the program
for three years would enable many improvements to be made, soon
enough to affect many programs for machine use now being made at
the cooperating institutions. The additional financial support to
carry out this development work is not large comparei to the con-
tributions now being made by IBM and by the cooperating institu-
tions, but the work cannot be done without additional funds.
