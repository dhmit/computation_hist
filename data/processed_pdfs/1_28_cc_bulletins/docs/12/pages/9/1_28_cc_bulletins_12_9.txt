The § sing in the MOP argument string above does not signal a following
ETC card since it is not followed by a blank or by columm 72, -

Remarks may be imcluded within macro definitioms, but for the
present there is a trestrictien that they will be termimated at the first

blank and must not contain sequences of longer than six characters betwsen
breck characters. :

——-x’onal Uetails on IRP

) An IRP eammot occur eéxplicitly im the range of an IRP, however a
MAC in the renge of an IRP may itself contain an IRP,

An IRP on an énpty argument or IRP b results in skipping all instruc-
tions down to the second IRP of the bracketing pair, If IRP Q is given in the
BNACro detnnntionp vhere Q is any symbol mot on the list of dummy arguments, the
bracketed sequence will always be skipped when the macro is expanded.

10, Added Details on MAC
.—--—“-“

Vhen parentheses are used in the variable field of a MAC some commas
become redundent and may be emitted, Specifieally, a comma is undersiood before
a left parsnthesis if it is not preceded by a comma or left parenthesis and
after a right parenthesis if it i mot followed by a eomma op right parenthesis_
\E’ With these conventions, suggestive programs in funetional motation can be
written, For example, define:

MOP COS,0P
MAC OP
TSX COS, 4
END COS

BOP AC
END AC

To take the cosine of the cosine of the contents of the AC, write
MAC COS(COS(AC))

This @a]ll could have beem written less suggestively asg
MAC COS, (COS, AC)

Any symbol in the location field of a MAC card will be defined
equal to the curremt value of the location counter,

it is mot necessary to restrict expressions to be substituted into
the location field withim a Bacro to 6 characters mor those to be substituted
into the operation field to 3 characters, A use of this feature i3 to substi-
tute bodily an entire imstruction . For sxample:s

MOP INSTR, XXX
XXX REMARR
EHD INSTR
