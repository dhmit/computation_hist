Dear Professor Morse:

Thank you very much for your detailed letter of 17 January 1955, It certainly
gives a clear picture of the present situation and an equally clear indication
of the possible alternatives confronting us as regards machine computation
research using WHIRLWIND during the period from now to 30 June 1956, Our
thinking too has been crystallized sufficiently so that we can indicate which
of the indicated alternatives we should prefer,

As regards what you call Project 6915, we should like to see the operation
continue at a level commensurate with the funds still available for this
Project which, as of 30 June 1955, you estimate as $70,000. Decisions as to
nature and size of eventual continuation of this Project beyond 30. June 1956,
will have to be deferred, of course, until the future of the entire Digital
Computer Laboratory and its mode of operation beyond that date is clarified,

When it comes to Project 6345, the operation of the machine itself, we definite-
ly prefer the solution for 1955-1956 which you have suggested to any of the
other alternatives you indicated, I think it is a fair estimate that the
machine should be able to earn about $50,000 to $60,000 a year doing computa-
tions on sponsored projects supported neither by ONR nor the Lincoln
Laboratories; and we shall be glad to supplement the amount of $70,000 under
this Project, unexpended as of June 1955, to the amount needed to continue the
operation of WHIRLWIND for scientific computations as in the past.

We are therefore anticipating a formal proposal, covering both projects, for
the period from 1 July 1955 to 30 June 1956 requesting additional funds up to
$30,000 in connection with the latter,

We shall certainly keep in close touch with you in the matter of resolving the
uncertainties and difficulties now foreseen in planning the operation beyond
30 June 1956; and a re-evaluation of this situation by December 1955, as you
suggest, is none too early to arrive at definitive decisions,

Sincerely yours,

F, JOACHIM WEYL, Director
