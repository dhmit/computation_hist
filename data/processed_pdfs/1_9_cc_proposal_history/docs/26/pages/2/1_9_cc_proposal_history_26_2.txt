A separate DIC project will be set up to handle the Type 704
utilization within the M.I.T. COMPUTATION CENTER, and a

separate request for GNR funds will be made. Current plans

indicate that Project 6345, as such, will terminate on June 30, 1957.
As a matter of fact, certain experienced programmers will be
transferred to the mew project on January 1, 1957. The estimated
budget for Project 6345 has been adjusted accordingly.

The task order for Project 6345 will include the
usual Whirlwind project activites:

1. Research in methods of numerical analysigs and
the formulation of scientific problems for
machine solution, together with the training
of personnel in these methods.

2. Support of the Scientific and Engineering
Applications group of Project WHIRLWIND so as
to make the computer useful and available for
the above-mentioned research.

In addition, the following task order arising in connection wifh
