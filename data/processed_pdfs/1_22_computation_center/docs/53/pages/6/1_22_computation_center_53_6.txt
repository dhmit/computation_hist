Syska & Hennessy indicated that they would re-design the new duct
equipment and submit their findings to IBM as soon as they have completed
their study. It was impossible to determime how much of a delay in
installetion was occasioned by this re-evaluation.

it is estimated that eight (8) thermo-couples must be installed
on the individual machines to provide adequate protection in case of break-
down of motor snd other aiy conditioning equipment., Similarly, it was
estimated that a fairly-elaborate INTERLOCK control circuit using microswitch-
operated dampers for control purposes, etc., must be installed and power
removed on an emergency power off" basis to protect the equipment,

My, Benesch indicated that although the present air conditioning
regquirements of the MIT Computation Center appeared te be in the vicinity
of 76.5 tons, Syska & Hennessy intends to imtall a single, 100-ton unit
for the MIT Computation Center. He indicated that it was not feasible to
jnatall two separate 50-tonm units es originally requested by Messrs, Verzuh
and Peterson, respectively.

Finally, considerable discussion was made of the possible completion
date of the building and a revised re-scheduling was suggested to insure that
the glass, sluminum, etc,, needed for the Computation Center part of Bldg., 26
would be available prior to January 1 to insure installation of the 704 as
per present schedule date of February, 1957.
