Molecular Quantum Mechanics-hr, n. Barnett
Dr. Barnett is attempting to predict through molecular

quantum mechanics the chemical and physical behavior of
gases and fuels. To handle even a simple case, involving a
molecule of 5-6 atoms with, on the order or, 20 electrons
would require about 50 hours of 70% time. The basic reasons
for this order of time requirement is that the potential
functions are highly specialized and complex, which in ma-
chine terms requires a large amount or storage, easy access
and very fast computation.
Crystalogggphio Data Reduction—Dr. N. Barnett

Dr. Barnett is attempting to enable physical chemists
to infer molecular structure from orystalographic data. The
problem again requires large processing requirements because
it is essentially an iterative process, requiring for each
of the many possible molecular configurations, the computa-
tion of electron densities that would correspond to the data.
Since even the electron density computations are involved,
and there are a large number of molecular struotures with a
given set of atoms, the time requirements are clearly beyond
the 704.
Solid State Physios~Dr. h. Barnett

To predict the electrical and mechanical properties of
a metal or alloy from energy level considerations requires on
the order of 15 hours. Since there is no limit to the num—
ber of possible alloy combinations, this class of problems
alone can clearly keep a very large machine occupied full time.
Mechanical Translation—Dr. Yngve

Until recently, Dr. Yngve‘s group has been occupied large—
ly with development of a programming language for linguistics.
The large scale usage of this language in solving research
problems in translation have yet to be felt by the Center.
As of today, even a moderate amount of translation (which re—
quires much relatively immediate random access to a large
dictionary and consideration of contextual meanings) would
