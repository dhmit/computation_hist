be written PXA , 4

The second example above typifies the rule that when a

subfield is to be zero, the character "Q" may be omitted,

leaving only the separating comma(s). Also, if one or

more subfields at the right-hand end of the variable field

are to be zero, these subfields may be omitted entirely,

together with their separating commas. Thus

LOCATION OP VARIABLE FIELD

TXH 0501

may be written TXH Sk

and I10CD ALPHA,O0,1

may be written I0CD ALPHA,,1

and TXH ALPHA,0,0

may be written TXH ALPHA

and PXA 0,0

may be written PXA

Any valid expression may appear in any subfield of the

variable field, and will be evaluated according to the

rules given for the evaluation of expressions (with

exceptions in the case of certain pseudo-operations, see

below) except that after an expression in the tag subfield

has been evaluated, only the rightmost three bits will be
used. (I.e., the tag is reduced modulo 8,)

Often a programmer wishes to refer to a cell containing

a constant. For example, if he wishes to add the number
one to the contents of the accumulator he must have some-
where in memory a cell containing the number one. Pseudo-
