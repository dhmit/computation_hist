II. Trapping (continued)

Transfer type instructions that violate the bounds as
such are not trapped. However, as mentioned above, all
"1" cycles are checked so a trap will occur on the first
instruction after a transfer that violates the bounds.

A "1" is put into position 17 of location 32 when this
occurso

* The effective delay in execution and protection against
I/b Traps is extended if the instruction following also
provides a one instruction grace period. It is expected
that a normal exit from the monitor will be:

ENE A
SPM B
SRM C
TRAix 32

until
No 1/0 traps will occur/after the TEA has been executed,

The protection and relocation will begin on the"1" cycle
following the TBAa
