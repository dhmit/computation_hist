Dear Dr. Morse,

Thank you for your letter of the thirteenth which I
received today after being out of town for a few days. I
spend almost as much time in Philadelphia as here, with
the possibility of having my Philadelphia mail remailed
to Washington in such a way that I lose out at both ends.
Your note was honored in this manner.

I have no immediate plans to be in Boston. However,
if none materialize fairly séon I will try to meke the trip
anyway. I will keep you informmed of my schedule.
Sincerely,

Gon HRavean

Ezra Glaser
