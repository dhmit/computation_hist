Professor fur Mathematik an
der Technischen Hochschule
Darmstadt, Germany

Dear Dr, Walther:

Do you know of a young German mathematician who might be
interested an a job, for two or three years, as programmer in our
new Computation Center? As you know, we have a 704 and need, on
our staff, three or four men with good mathematical background and
experience in coding for computing machines, Their task is to help
develop service routines, to help the users of the 704 (faculty and
students of New England Colleges) when they get into serious
programming difficulties, and to do some research on their own.

The beginning salary would be about $6,000 per year,

If you know anyone who might be interested, please ask
him to write me,

I will be in Europe in August - September this year and

may have a chance to get to Germany, Will you be in Darmstadt at
that time?

S8incerely yours,

P, M, Morse
Director
