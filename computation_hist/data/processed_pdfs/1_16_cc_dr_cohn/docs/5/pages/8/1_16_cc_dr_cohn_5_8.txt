at A, the characteristics actually extend some distance beyond A as shown. In the
simple waves u,x and w are known on A3,, and AB l, . Hence <1> and alt/6X... are known
by (2.9). The characteristic initial value problem for (2.11) with these initial data will
have a unique solution in some sufﬁciently small characteristic quadrilateral ABRC’BL ,
where C may be assumed to be on the Y—axis. Since the initial data are symmetrical
with respect to the Y-axis, so is <1). Extend <I> beyond BRC’ as the velocity potential of a
conical simple wave. In general, the corresponding straight characteristics will not be
centered. However, if the double wave ABRCBL is kept small enough, their envelope
and intersections can be kept arbitrarily close to E I, , well beyond the boundary to be
constructed later. Between the two simple waves in X > 0 there falls a region of uniform
ﬂow with the velocity mm of BR . Extend the deﬁnition of <I> symmetrically with respect
to the Y—axis. Finally, between the two non-centered simple waves there falls a region
of uniform ﬂow with the velocity ux3 of C’.

It remains to choose a boundary in z > 0. First let U0 , U2" , UH , and U denote
the points where rays from (0, 0, 0) parallel to 21.0 , u.” , It.” , and um intersect z = 1.
Let G ”on, starting from the right edge of the right hand non—centered simple wave, be
on the line ERUM . Then um, is tangent to the corresponding plane through the origin.
Let FRGR be an integral curve of the equation dX/(u —— wX) = dY/(v — wY) of conical
stream sheets. The ﬁnal part of the boundary in X > 0 consists of the segment FRUa
which corresponds to a plane to which u. is tangent. Extend the boundary symmetrically
into X < 0.

Note that near Us (2.11) is of elliptic type.

It is interesting to observe that an alternation of double waves. simple waves, and
regions of uniform ﬂow similar to that in Fig. 6 also appears in an intersection of simple
waves which occurs when uniform plane supersonic ﬂow expands into an inﬁnite sector.
This is shown schematically in Fig. 7.
