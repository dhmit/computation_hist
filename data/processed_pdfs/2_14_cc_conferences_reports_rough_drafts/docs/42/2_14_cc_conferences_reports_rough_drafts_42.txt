- Rough draft of the Minutes of the Simulation Conference with
M.I.T., Computation Center, and I.B.M. arch Groups
Tec. 20, 1987

Those present included (see list of persons who attended taken by Verzuh)

Morse opened the meeting at 10:00 a.m. in the Science Library
conference Room. He brought out that the meeting was the first one
of a series wherein it was desired to exchange 1deas and not just
discuss explicit simulation problem.

Galliher firstly presented some material and discussed
simulations they are doing and thinking about, and in addition, to
ome of the problems he felt were worth doing. He brought out that
the group he headed was an interdepartmental group gt M.I.%2. of
graduate students interested in operations research. He outlined
three different problems: (1) a systems inventory problem, (2) a

general purpose finite population waiting-1line problem, and (3) a

 

 

traffic flow problem; the first two be classified as stochastic

 

Markov processes and the third he described as perturbations of a
deterministic system. In discussing problem 1 he brought out the
problem of sampling exponential distributions and discussed the merits
of table look-up versus generation. Under problem 2 he discussed

the explicit problem of machine repair and discussed a procedure of
solution wherein the bookkeeping of the stochastic simulation 1S
maintained by means of a "tpansaction table". As a sample of the
third type of problem, he quoted that of tunnel flow in one of the
ounnels leading into New vork. He discussed the fact that measured

tunnel flow does nol agree with that which would arise from a


deterministic model. Therefore, there was being attempted a
simulation model which would explain the current behavior and which
could be used in the future for further studies. Other problems
which were similar to the third problem are the case of the Boston
Fire Department and that of operation of a steel mill.

At 10:50, Morse summarized two classes of problem; (1) those
with time variability and (2) those with definite time intervals.

He discussed the purpose of sinulation as being (1) to explain or
test; and (2) that after the simulation is performed, the resultant
simulation program offers a procedure for looking at the complex
operation as to relating statistical properties.

Talk drifted around to explicit machine properties which
might be désired, and Baker queried whether special purpose instructions
might be useful for distribution function look-up. Galliher brought
up the need for random numbers. Hogett, Galliher, Kimball, Moller
and Morse then became involved in detailed discussions of the
desirability of using Poisson distributions versus arbltrary distri-

bution functions. Tchebyschev polynomials, approximations, and So

forth. \

At 11:15, Kimball spoke. He said that his examples are
similar to Galliher's and mentioned that in his opinion a multi-
controlled computer sharing common memory 1s a possibility of a
computer improvement. He said the objective in his problems is to
find the best set of operational rules; for example, the method of
Box. However, since the difficulty of the Box technique is the

possibility of overlooking a variable, he feels that dynamic programming

then outlined the procedure of a simulation with dynamic programming
as: wrong policy, simulation, state values, dynamic programming,
petter policy. He pointed out that Belman's contribution was tO
show that improvement always Occurs (Arden has reservations about
some of the things that Kimball stated with regard to Belman's proofs)
McCarthy pointed out the similarity to chess move evaluation.

At 11:30 a coffee break was taken.

At 11:50 Baker discussed an on-line data processor which was
being developed DY 1.B.M. This machine is tO allow continuous
communication of each operator with the machine. A typical application
would be a group of operators receiving sales orders each tied TO the
computer and the machine 1tself tied to the transaction group.

Computer operation would presumably be assynchronous, but there would
be many questions as to the number of logical units, the number of
memory units and possibility of unit failures, the sScope€ of operations,
the possibilities of the queries to the computer, and the question

of a responding-type memory .
