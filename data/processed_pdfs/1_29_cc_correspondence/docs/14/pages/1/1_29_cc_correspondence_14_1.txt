Dear Sir:

As a user of the Computation Center's facilities, you are asked to
file a Progress Report with the Center each quarter. The attached form
is meant to simplify this task and channel your efforts, as well as
serving as your request form for next quarter's computer time.

The changes to our physical plant required for the installation of
an IBM 7090 are now in process, and the new computer should be operating
by the middle of January.

When requesting computer time for next quarter, you should remember
that the 7090 is expected to be, on the average, about three times as fast
as the 709,

The completed form should be returned to :

Qe Pl=Rs

Computation Center, Rm. 26-142
M.I.T.

Cambridge 39, Massachusetts

A prompt return of this form will be appreciated

Sincerely, '

. %. corbatd
Associate Director
