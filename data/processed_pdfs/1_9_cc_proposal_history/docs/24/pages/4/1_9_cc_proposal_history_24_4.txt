Senior Elective

Machine-Aided Analysis Instructor in charge: W.K. Linvill
hours: 3-0-6 (=3 units) Prerequisite: M22-Diff. Equations

Survey of engineering analysis problems wherein machine comput-
ation is useful. Summary of modern machine computation techniques
available to solve these problems. Study of computing machinery of
the analog type and where possible a comparison of digital and ana-
logue computation techniques. Elementary presentation of numerical
analysis and solution of typical engineering problems by numerical |
methods. Interpretation of arithmetical and logical sequences into I
digital -computer instructions. Survey of applications of punched- |
card calculators.

Graduaté Electives

Introduction to Digital Computer Instructor in charge: C.W. Adams
Coding and Logic Prerequisite: MR2-Diff. Equations
hours: 3-0-6 (=3 units)

 

Survey of principles of logical design and of the elements of
coding programs for large-scale digital computers, discussed from the \
user's point of view. Brief description of the logical structure of |
digital computers operating at M.I.T. and elsewhere. Interpretation
of sequences of arithmetical and logical operations into digital
computer instructions, with examples chosen from typical engineering,
scientific, and business problems and from real-time control applic-
ations. Techniques for simplifying and improving the programming and
operating of computers by the use of subroutines. Execution on the |
M.I.T. Whirlwind I computer of examples discussed in class to provide I
first-hand experience with automatic high-speed machines.

forms of storage and terminal equipment, for detecting errors and
mistakes in programs and for controlling scale factors. Emphasis on
the use of subroutines. Laboratory work demonstrating performance by
Whirlwind I computer of programs prepared by the class. At least one
problem of his own choice programmed by each student, as well as pre=-
pared on punched paper tape and executed on Whirlwind I computer.
