Morse pointed out that the next two months were the time
to piek good men for research assistenteships for next year. From
four to six positions would be open.

Forrester said he had been zsked by Dr. Smith of ONR whether
the Association for Computing Machines could have i1tz spring (or gummer)
meeting here. The Commitlee felt that this would be appropriate and
agked Adams to £ind out whether the last half of June or the firast
half of Septembder would be preferred. When this is dstermined, an
official invitation can be issued and plans begun.

There was a further discuasion of the E, E. courses in
machine computation for seniors and first-year graduate students. The
Committee felt it was important that the one-term survey course, dis-
cusged at the last mesting, ©e@ given this coming term. It also felt
that a one-term course in punch-card techniques, at B level, ghould
be started next fall if possible.
