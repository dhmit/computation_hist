SUBJECT: Material for National Science Foundation Proposal

 

In accordance with our discussions regarding the proposal to NSF,
I am enclosing the following information.

 

The M.I.T. Computation Center will have a Type 704 Electronic
| Data Processing Machine with the following machine complement:
12 magnetic tape units, 2 magnetic CORE storage units containing a
total of 8,000 words, 1 magnetic drum unit containing 4,000 words
of storage, the usual on-line punched card reader, alphabetic printer,
and punched caxd recorder as well as the 3 off-line magnetic tape
controlled printer, magnetic tape controlled card punch, and punched

to the 704, thers will be 10 ausiiisvy prmahod card machines including
card punches , collators, sorters, reproducers, interpreters, and the
Type 407 Accounting Machine. regate BE rental, #8 in
excess of § 50,000 per monthy Re dowale & by BW,

The Type 704 EDPM unit is one of the fastest large-scale
commercial computers available today. Since the M.I.T. installation
will be but one of many in the field, techniques, programs, and
numerical procedures developed for this machine will be of umivewsal useoy
