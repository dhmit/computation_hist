' Dear Frank:

Enclosed is a schedule for the entertainment of approximately
thirty economists of the Federal neserve Lanxs o Ghe united
States who in some sort of a convention in Doston are coming
to M, I, T, on the morning of Honday, May 13, under the spon-
sorship of Mr, Wallace Dickson whom I understand Lo be GThe
Director of Publiec Information of the Federal Reserve Bank

of Boston., The schedule up through 10:30 is firm, also from
12:00 m. to 1:30. There remains the perlod in between uhlch
I have listed on the enclosed schedule as for the Echell lNoom
in Building 52 from 10340 to 11:50 in your charge.

Should the computer "704"™ which was our originel objective be
in any condition to show them, thls schedule can have thelr
10:40 destination changed accordingly, and it would then be
gsgential only to get them to the Faculty Club iz time %o
start lunch at 12:00,

It is my understanding that if "704L" is not in shape at that
time, you or someone provided by you will endeavor to engage
this group in informative conversation of some sort in the
Schell Room for the period indicated,

The telephone connectlion by which I contact Dickson 1s HAncock
6=7100, and I think it would be first rate 1 you can find

out from him more about the capacities of these people and
what can be best done for them, Your assumption of this nebu=-
lous assignment ls much eppreclated,

Sincerely yours,
