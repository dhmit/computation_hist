Formation of the Computation Center - This generous

and constructive contribution has made it possible to
establish a Computation Center at MIT, with some of the
characteristics of = Department, to implement the contract
and to serve as a center for researeh into new and better
ways of utilizing high speed computers and for eduscat ion

in these new ang better ways. During the year covered by
this contraet, since the equipment was not yet installed,
activity has been largely eonfined to Â¢rgainlzing the
Center, setting up the Communication links with the cooper-
ating Institutions, arranging for the additional 3upport

for the staff and planning for training courses ang regsearch
activities, though a ecertain amount of research has actually
been started. Eaea of these aspects of activity will be
