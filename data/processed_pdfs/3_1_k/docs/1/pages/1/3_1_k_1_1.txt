_ Dear Phil:

-<-uc'¢=

I am encloaing 8 copy or a memo deaeribing our

| timo-ubaring subscription line proposal, a copy of our memo

to the M, I.T, Audit Divilion dcseribing onr time~accounting

_precodurea, and a requisition from Records Processing and

Studies for one double rate time-shnring line, Since the
whole 1dca of aolling conpater sorvico is quite new to me;’

I am not sure what the proper procedures are. I hope that

this requinition and these memoranda, with the further note
that the accounting transfers should be to account 763h is
sufficient to get all the machinery in motion,

At the end of each month I will send you, or
whomaver you designate, a copy of the computer time used by
Records Processing and Studles, or any future subseribers,
in a form which, I hope, you will be able to use for billing.
The subseribers themselves will also get a copy of this
report. ;
| If there seems to be anything we are not doing
according to Institute rules or something we are dolng that
won't work, would you please let me know as soon as possible,
As a matter of fact, if we seem to be doing things right, I
would appreciate hearing that also. Thank you for your help
in this matter, |

Yours truly,
