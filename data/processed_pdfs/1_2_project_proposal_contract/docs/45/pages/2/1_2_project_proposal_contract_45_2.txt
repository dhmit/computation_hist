- Dear Nat:

The enclosed request for a proposal from ARDC for

. research in the use of computing machines has received very
considerable attention from several menmbers of the Physics ,
Department. It is a problem which is of considerable inter-
est to several of us, in fact it is & problem very similar . .
in its scope to part of the task-order in the OHR-Whirlwind
contract. It is this similarity, as a matter of fact, which
- has led to our hesitation. = i

We are already doing part of the work outliined 1in
this regquesty we are anxious to do the rest. DBut we feel
it might be better to do this work under one combined con-
tract instead of trying to serve two masters, so to speak.
Since we have no need of additional funds this year to carry
on, we can afford to wait until some one from ARDC comes up
here to talk over the best way to do what they want to get
done. I would like to have a chance to talk to Dr. Skinner
who, I believe, is the senior civilian in ARDC, about our
plans for the use of the big machines at Tech, for research
and for training. If this can be arranged, please let re
Knowve. . |

Yours, .
