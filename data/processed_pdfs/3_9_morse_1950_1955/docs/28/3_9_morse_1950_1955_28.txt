Dear Professor Morse:

On a visit to three of M.I.T.'s computing facilities Thursday
the wide difference in policy as to charge for machine-time was
made apparent to me.

Three gentlemen were up from the Du Pont company to get some
assistance in solving 250 solutions of a couple of simultaneous
non-linear differential equations. We started at Whirlwind where
the present policy calls for no charge in solving an acceptable

roblem. The next stop was the Differential Analyzer where the

160.00 a day charge seemed reasonable enough. The last facility
vigited was the Analogue Computer in DACL where the current pol-
icy calle for a charge of $300.00 per hour of mechine-time which
does include the programming and preparation of a finsl report.

This difference ie &t least partly due to the sponsorship of
these various computers and I imagine that Bureau of Ordinance or
Army Ordinance has tried to have some say ia DACL's policy. Whirl-
wind on the other hand is not yet fully developed and these accep-
table problems are presumably aiding in its development and, there-
fore, the Whirlwind staff encourages them. There is also the fact
that DACL, having split off from Meteor proper, must now pay its
own WEY.

These factors have doubtless been considered at length by your
comuitiee, but I must admit I was not able to offer the Du Pont
pecple a rational explanation for these discrepancies.

Sincerely yours,
We Ls Allison
