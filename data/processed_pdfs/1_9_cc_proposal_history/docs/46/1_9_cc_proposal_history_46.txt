Sub ject: High-Speed Computing Equipment for the Institute,
a Proposal

Requirements - The Institute needs a service computing center,
equipped with modern high-speed computing machines administered
by a service staff, in order to carry forward its educational pro-
gram in three general flelds:

(a) General Educational Research - Many engineering
and scientific research problems carried on by students and staff
require the help of high-speed computing equipment to carry out
the related calculations. Many industries, hiring our graduates,
prefer to hire men who have had some experience in using such
equipment. :

(pb) Development of Control Equipment - The Institute
is a leader in the development of special control equipment (as,
for example, the automatic milling machine) which often involves
the design of special-purpose computers. In many cases, the ini-
tial part of the development is facilitated by being able to try
out ideas on a general-purpose computer.

(¢) Business Data Handling and Operations Research -
A very promising field of machine application is in business adminis-
tration. The end products will often be special-purpose machines
(for handling bank deposits or insurance premiums, or the like),

but much of the development can use a general-purpose computer to

try out ideas. In addition, many production-scheduling and other
operations research problems of business and industry need a high-
speed computer for their solution.

Already the requirements for machine time for thesis
work and for general faculty research in these categories occupy
about half the time of a high-speed machine. In addition, four
courses (6.25, 6.535, 6.538, 16.91) involve training in machine
coding and require a falr aaount of machine time for the students;
another dozen or more related courses could use some machine time
if it were available. (See Appendix A.) Over and beyond these,
primarily educational, needs are the computing requirements of the
various DIC and DDL projects, which could use up all the time of
a machine by themselves. However, such projects can well afford


“Zw

to pay for the machine time they need; we are here concerned with
the growing educational requirements for machine time, which will
be unsatisfied uniess some means of financing machine operation
can be devised which does not make the machine a satellite of some
DIC project.

In categories a, b and ¢, high-speed computing equipment
has become just as necessary as a machine shop is for experimental
research and for educational training in some fields. The Institute
must somehow provide, as a standard aid in educational research, a
combination of computing machines, with input and output equipment,
plus a maintenance and programming staff, in a space adequate to
handle student training. The computing equipment should include
a high-speed digital machine (equivalent to Whirlwind I or one of
IBM's 700 series) and a slower-speed machine (like the IBM CPC or
650) for preliminary training and for certain simple computing

asks.

Present Situation - At present the Institute has the necessary
equipment, in two separate establishments, precariously financed
for only one more year.

Whirlwind I was built by ONR, and the Navy has contribu-
ted $200,000 a year to make it available 40 per cent of the time
for general research. The rest of the time has been used up by
Project Lincoln, which has pald for maintenance, operation and
further improvements. Lincoln now has its own machine and will
need Whirlwind I less and less; the Navy feels 1t has contributed
enough and will contribute for only one more year. In fact,
Whirlwind will not be able to keep running next year unless 1¢
charges for some of the computing it does. The rate, calculated
to keep it running on an austerity basis, has to be about $250
per hour. This rate will, of course, be so high as to put the
services of Whirlwind out of reach of graduate students and ordil-
nary faculty members, and only the wes thier DIC projects will be
able to afford it if it must finance itself entirely by such
charges. :

But Whirlwind is not a complete computing center by it-
self. The rest of the needed equipment, the punched-card machines,
are run by the Institute Office of Statistical Services, with a
separate staff. This organization also has had to charge for
much of its computing services, to the Inatltute's administration
and to DIC projects, squeezing enough out of them to be able to
afford to carry out a few thesis and other educational research
calculations free of charge. The M.I.T. administration pays about
£16,000 per year of the cost of thls Office, in return for which
the Office handles student registration, alumni office and other
administrative computing services.


=F

What would be desirable would be to consolidate
equipment into one unit, with a single group of people nas it
and then to get someone to support at least the machine mainte- 2

nance and operating costs. The costs for the programming staff

(one senior administrator, 6 to 10 computer-technicians, 4 to 6

research assistants plus the 8 technicians now employed b
Institute for M.I.T. administrative machine Te) coney a
be born by the Institute in the way we support shop technicians,
as a necessary part of an educational staff. The scientific
supervision could come from faculty members already here. If
there were free time over and above the worthwhile educational
research needs of the Institute, computing time could be sold to
DIC and DDL projects for enough to pay for part or all of the
salaries of this programming staff. For example, if 1/4 of the
time were available for DIC work, and the DIC projects paid at a
‘rate corresponding to the commercial rentals of the IBM equipment
(£28,000 per month), they would Just about pay for the programming
staff salaries. It probably would not be wise to allow DIC projects
to have too large a fraction of machine time, even at the first
and it not be wise to sell computer time to any outside organiza-~
tion, for this would be competing with companies that pay full
rates for their IBM equipment.

Unfortunately, if Whirlwind is to be the high-speed part
of this combination, the costs will be considerably greater than
those outlined in the preceding paragraph. Whirlwind is still an
excellent machine, but it was one of the first ones bullt and it
was not designed for space-saving or for cheapness of upkeep. It
could not be easily moved, so that if a combined computer service
were to be set up, the IBM equipment of Statistical Services would
have to be moved to the Barta Bullding, further away from the ad-
ministrative offices it serves than it is now. Or else two sepa-
rate groups would have to be continued, with consequent duplications
of personnel.

 

IBM Interest - The IBM Corporation has a considerable interest in
The training of scientists and engineers in the use of computing
equipment, and 1t has had some contacts with the Institute. In
another two years it will be turning out equipment (types 704 and
705) which will be nearly as fast as Whirlwind, will be better
equipped as to input and output facilities, will be considerably
smaller in size and power requirements and which will fit much
better with our present IBM equipment to make a single computing
service center. If IBM can be ‘induced to give us a remodelled T0l
or a TO4 or 705, rent-free, and to remit further charges on the
equipment Statistical Services now has but keeping up maintenance
of the equipment, the Institute would then have a computing center
which could effectively and efficiently satisfy the computing
needs in categories a, b and ¢c. M.I.T. itself would then only need
to pay for the service staff and the power costs, which might be
paid in part by some paid computing service for DIC and DDL projects.

IBM is Very much interested in Supporting research and
education in categories 8, b and ¢ mentioned above, particularly
in category e. The Institute is, at present, in the forefront
in categories a and b and is rapidly drawing to the fore in cate-
EOry ¢. Dr. Cuthbert Hurd, head of Research for IBM, in a conference
with Carl Floe ang Phil Morse, has shown considerable interest in
