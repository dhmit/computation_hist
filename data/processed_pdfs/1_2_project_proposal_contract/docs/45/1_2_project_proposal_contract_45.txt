The Institute presently has in operation, supported
by the Alr Force, a Differential Analyser, a REAC, end the
“hirlwind Digital Computer (to which the lavy also coniri-
butes.) Ve have also an ONR program conducted by Frof.

"Morse and some of his colleagues.

Becsuse of the undoubted overlap between what we
ere now doing, and what you wish done under “Statement of
vork", we believe it would be advisable to have Lr, Horse
talk with Lt. Col. H. C. Henry &né to Dr, Skinner who, we
understand, is senior civilien in ARDC, end would be par-
ticularly interested in thle ares.

hegause of the numbers of people involved and the
complexity of the problem I think it woulc be advisable
1f the suggested meeting could be held at the Institute
where the equipment and personnel can be esslly assembled.

Very truly yours,

Mr. Hi MeL. Sage

~~ Dear Nat:

The enclosed request for a proposal from ARDC for
research in the use of computing machines has received very
considerable attention from several members of the Physics
Department. It is a problem which is of considerable inter-
est to several of us, in fact it is a problem very similar =
in its scope to part of the task-order in the OHR-Whirlwind
contract. It is this similarity, as a matter of fact, which
- has led to our hesitation. 2 A

We are already doing part of the work outlined in
this reguestj we are anxious to do the rest. Dut we feel
it might be better to do this work under ons combined con-
tract instead of trying to serve two masters, so to speak.
Since we have no need of additional funds this year to carry
on, we can afford to wait until some one from ARDC comes up
here to talk over the best way to do what they want to get
done. I would like to have a chance to talk to Dr. Skinner
who, I believe, is the senior civilian in ARDC, about our
plans for the use of the big machines at Tech, for research
and for training. If this can be arranged, please let ne
KNOW. |

Yours, .

PM sd Philip HM. Morse
