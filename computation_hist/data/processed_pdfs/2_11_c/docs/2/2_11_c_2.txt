Dear Professor Morse:

Professor Rafael W, Davila of the University of San Marcos, Lima,
Peru, has been visiting here for the last several months, Fe is particularly
interested in preparing material for courses in numerical analysis to present
in Lima, He feels that there may be little chance of getting a powerful
machine there in the near future, so he is interested in the numerical analysis
and not primarily in machines,

On his way home he intends to stop by Chicago and to be there
approximately between January 16 - 17, I have suggested that he might call
YOu,

I believe that Professor Davila will be interested in your ideas
of most valusble content for numerical analysis courses and that he will be
interested in the work of your group.

I believe that his main interest is in astronomy, but Professor
Davila's interests in numerical analysis are largely mathematical, I am
certain that he and the students at Lima will benefit from any discussion
he has with you and your group. I believe that he will plan to call you
when he arrives,

Best regards,

Sincerely,

=
