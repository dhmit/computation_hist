Dear Dr, Morse:

In response to your letter of 13 May, I have been thinking about
the general question of meetings among computer center directors.
My mounting impression has been that such directors can afford the time
and travel if the meetings are more regional than national, Even if we
use one of the joint computer conferences, at the western conferences
most of the people from the east will not attend and vice versa, The
ideal situation, of course, was that at Endicott last year when IBM was
the host,

My reaction, therefore, would be to have an annual meeting at
one of the big conferences, alternating the portion of the country, and
never expecting more than regional attendance, An alternative is to
make such an arrangement tentative, depending on who appears at the
meeting, and deciding at the last minute whether to hold such a special
session, Beyond this, as you have remarked, the most fruitful dis-
cussions are either tete-a-tete or in small groups.

Sincerely,

ood unl Arn

Dr, Saul Gorn
Director
