MIDPME —- DOUBLE-PHRECISION SOLUTION OF MATRIX EQUATIONS

"R.M. Moroney 9 July 1958
M.I.T. “Operations Research Project

This routine is dedicated to the proposition that anybody fooling around
with double-precision numbers is worried about loss of significant figures
somewhere, and very likely in the solution of a set of linear equations.
Consequently no computer time is spared in milking the best possible re-
suits from the coefficient matrix supplied, and an estimateyog the~signi-

ficant figures in the solution vector is computed.

8. This routine requires one tape unit whose logical number ﬁusﬁ be spe=
cified by a card of the form: NINE EQU X . X is noraally 9.

b. This routine contains a modified version of RS005 which is avéilable
to the user. Modifications consist only of return to i + 1 instead of

X ¢+ 2 on the two sequences TSX S005, L and TSX S005 + 5 4. This rou-

- T ——

tine contains a tapewriting routine BOUTS? and a tape reading routine
BLINS, which are available to the user. See Appendix I. This routine
contains a set of floating-écint checking routines ADDOV, MULTO, and
DIVCK, which are available tolthe user. See Appendix II.

c.The coefficient matrix and right-hand side must be in normal form for
RS005, i.e. least-significant part of number in register succeeding
most-significant part, aggreement in sign between both parts, exponent
of least-significant part 33 (octal) less than that of most significant |
part. Error estimates must be normaliged single-register floating-point |

numbers (error estimates will be defined later).
