THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION
49 West U49th Street, New York 20

Dear Professor Morse:

October 31, 1956

Many thanks for your letter of October 30 and the attached
application which we had discussed here orally some weeks ago and,
subsequently, rather priefly by telephone.

I expect to be in Cambridge on other matters on November 8

and until early afternoon on November 9.

Would it be at all

possible for me to see you during my visit? I find the statement
of the project quite clear and straightforward. All the same, T
would hope that perhaps a few minutes with one of your assistants
might give a sense of concreteness to my understanding of this
proposal which, so far, has been obtained entirely orally and

from reading.

I should like also to raise with you the item of overhead
at 20 per cent included in your budget.
that this Foundation has a strong working rule agalinst the
inclusion of any flat percentage for overhead, except 1in the
very rare case where the Foundation itself has 1in effect taken
The word overhead, however, has a

the initiative in a project.

You are probably aware

wide wariety of connotations and I think it might be helpful if
we could discuss it together.

I expect to check into the Commander in Cambridge on
Wednesday night and, if you find it more convenlent, you could
leave word for me there.

Professor Philip M. Morse
