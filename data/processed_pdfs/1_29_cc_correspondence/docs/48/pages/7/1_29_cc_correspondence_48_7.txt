APPENDIX IIX

ONEXT  Solve matrix equation Axe D'y, when Ax< b has been solved by MIDPME.
1. This routine provides a large s&ving in time when solving for & new
-a&nd side, Calling sequence is same as for MIDFNE except that X must

contain TSX DNEXT, 4, Resnlto, error stops, etec., are all the asanme s NIDPME,

2+ NIDPME writes {ive records on NI-NINE: @, &,D, N, I-MA. D is the first
the other letters ere expleained in the main writeup,
Upon exit from Wes, NMT-NINT is vositioned to read A ss the next rscord.,

fhis is for convenience of user. who &y went to resd in A by BLINS; the

reads in I-NA and starts iterating, The paris of NIDPAE thet form nd

eX1t, Ddut since it uses the bdlook written by MIDRVE, changes in C between
use o' NIDPNE and DNEXT will be lost,
