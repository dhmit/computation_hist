WWJOR DR. FLOR

With the letter of March 30, 1961, signed
by Professors Pano, Horse and myself, we enclosed a
copy of Professor Teager's report, but not the final
copy of the report, reflecting more accurately the
majority opinion. I am transndtting this report to
you herewith. I believe that this concludes the
documents which I shall forward to you.

I can assure you that my opinion concerning
the need for strengthening computer facilities at £4.13.
has been enhanced during the past few weeks. Although
there is a split in the Committee's report, I again
suggest that their agreements are much more important
to the problems of 14.13. than are their disagreements.

I think 14.1.1 should strive very hard to
realize the establishment of a computation center much
greater than our pmsent facilities with the 709 and
with the tawbe—expected 7090.

I have suggested to the members of the original
study group that copies of all reports be distributed to
a group of about twenty-to—thirty people at M.I.T., who
have a deep interest in and appreciation of these problems.
I would also suggest that other copies of the report be
put on file in the ELF. headquarters for distribution upon
request. I have made these statements clear to as many
of the original study group as I could find, and I think
they understand them very clearly, and to some extent go
along with them.

The above statements are strictly my own and
not those of Professors Pane, Morse or Wiesnet. I believe
that they will not disagree with me but if they should so
choose, I trust they will write to you directly.

With the distribution of this report to a select
group, and the establishment of a distribution center in
the RLE headquarters, I trust my task as Chairman of the
Committee has ended.
