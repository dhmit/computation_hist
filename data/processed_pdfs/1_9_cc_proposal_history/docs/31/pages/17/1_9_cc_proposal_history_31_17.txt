use of REAC. The machine can also display unstable solutions
to problems.

There is also in use in connection with the above a Tracking
Control Simulator designed for a particular system. Ihis machine
appears to be somewhat analogous to the Flight Simulator avail-
able in D.A,C.L, Passive networks are also used to simulate par-
ticular systems. A cathode-ray-tube-type function generator 1is
used in conjunction with this computer.

Another machine in use is a Fourler Synthesizer which can
add sine and cosine functions of various frequencies. In other
words, the machine sums Fourler series. It can handle 24 har-
monies at one time. Answers are tracked on tape.

Mention should also be made of a ‘home-made' Auto-Correlator
which calculates the auto-correlation function \‘f(t) f(t+t) of
a given function f(t). It also calculates j f{(t) and jfz(’c).
This machine is not very accurate due to tracking difficulties

and is in little use.

Center of Analysis. By far the largest analog computer in
use at the Institute is the M,I.T. Differential Analyzer. This is
not the original differential analyzer that was Iintroduced at M.I.T
tn 1930 (and now no longer here), but a newer and larger machine
that was placed in operation in 1942. It is under the supervision
of the Center of Analysis,

The machine is electro-mechanical, the value of a variable
being represented by the angle through which a rotating shaft
turns. In addition to the basic arithmetical operations, the

machine performs integration and functional data insertion
