SHOT: Iaterial for National Science Foundation Proposal

W

In accordance with our discussions regarding the proposal to 3131',
I an enclosing the following information.

Inchine mlment 9i 93 11.1.1'. mutnticn Center

no ILL'l'. Computation Center will have a Type 704 Electronic
Data Processing Inchine with the tollcwing machine complement:
12 magnetic tape units, 2 magnetic cons storage units containing a
total of 8,000 words, 1 magnetic drum unit containing 4,000 words
of storage, the usual 3-11“ punched card reader, alphabetic printer,
and punched card recorder as well as the 3 gig-line magnetic tape
controlled printer, magnetic tape controlled card punch, and punched
card-tomagnetic tape converter, respectively. Total machine
complement net monthly» rental is slightly over $45,000. In addition
to the 704, there will be 1_o auxiliary punched card machines including
card punches, collators, sortera, reproducere, interpreters, and the

Type 407 Accounting Machine. The aggregate machine rental is in
excess of $ 50,000 per month.

 

 

'me Type 704 ED!!! unit is one of the fastest large-scale
commercial computers available today. Since the 11.1.1 installation
will be but one of many in the field, techniques, programs, and
numerical procedures developed for this machine will be 0: universal use.

Biographical Information

Dr. F. u. Verzuh, Director of Statistical Services, has been
connected with the operation of M.l.'r. computational work since 1940.
In this capacity he has had considerable experience with the utilization
of various analog computing equipment -- differential analyzers, etc.,

as well as a comlete line of digital machines ranging from the IBM
Type 601 through the Type 704.

lie received a 3.5. degree in Electrical Engineering iron the
University of Denver in 1940, a 11.3. degree in Electrical Engineering

from ILLT. in 1946, and a Son. degree in Electrical Engineering :frcm
LLT. in 1952.


uted for various branches
of the armed services. In July, 1955 he was placed in charge of the

operation of the Whirlwind Computer -- the high—speed machine currently-
used for scientific research at the Institute. Assn, several research
projects are being conducted using this computer as a basic tool.
