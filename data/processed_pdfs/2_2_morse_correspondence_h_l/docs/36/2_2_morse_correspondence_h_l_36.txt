Lf THE DIGITAL COMPUTER AS A LABORATORY TOOL*{
(Electronic Digital Computation of Optical Constants of Thin Metal Films)
ARTHUR L. LOEB Axo HARRY H. DENMAN

1. Introduction. An electronic digital computer at Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology, Whirlwind I, has been successfully applied to problems
concerning thin metal films. While the need for and results of the computa-
tions have been described elsewhere, [1, 2, 3], the present paper deals with
the computation techniques applied on Whirlwind I. Since the mathemati-
al problem is essentially that of solving two simultaneous, complicated,
implicit transcendental equations, the methods employed may be of general
interest; the exact form of the equations involved is of minor importance

here.
In developing the program the following factors have been taken into
account:

A. Flexibility of application.

B. Ease of communication by scientists who are not familiar with Whirl-
wind I.

C. Ease of interpretation of the results by these scientists.

D. Automatic handling of large amounts of data.

E. Speed of operation.

F. Economy of storage in the computer memory.
The steps involved in putting such a problem on the computer are de-
scribed in some detail here.

2. The physical problem. The properties of thin metal films deposited
on thick non-absorbing backings are examined by measuring the reflectance,
R, and transmission, 7’, of radiation nearly perpendicularly incident on
the films or on the backings. Two of these properties, the index of refrac-
tion, n, and the absorption coefficient, k, are related to the reflectance and
transmission by the following equations [1, 2],

tions just referred to cannot be inverted, (R, T') cannot be directly trans
formed into the (n, k) plane. Since the method described in this section for
R and T is completely analogous to that for R’ and 7’, no special mention
of R’ will be made here unless a distinction between R and R’ needs to be
stressed.

A pair of values of n and k, (ng, ko), is to be found which transforms into
(Ro, Th), a pair of observed values for reflectance and transmission. As
first estimate a point (n., k.) is chosen, which transforms into (R,, T,)
as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Since R, # Roand T, # Ts, (n., ka.) is not the
desired point. A displacement (ny — n,, ko — k.) should be found in the
(n, k) plane corresponding to a displacement (Ry — R,, Ty — 7.) in the
(R, T) plane. An infinitesimal displacement (8R, 67) transforms into the
(n, k) plane according to the equations

The partial derivatives dR/an, dR/dk, dT /dn, and dT /dk can be obtained
analytically from (1), (2), (4), (5), (6), and (7). However, because of their
complexity and since they will only be used in the approximate equations
(10) and (11), it was decided to use the method outlined below.

The values of the partial derivatives are found approximately by trans-
forming three points in the (n, k) plane into corresponding points in the
(R, T') plane:

(Na , ko) transforms into (Ra, Ta).
(ne + 6, ko) transforms into (Ry, T%).
(Ng , ka + 8) transforms into (ER. , 1):

By replacing the partial derivatives by the corresponding first order
difference expressions, equations (12) to (16) become:

(The notation “dR” and “dT” for experimental errors was necessitated by
i the fact that Whirlwind I cannot print out Greek symbols such as A.)

"The successive approximation method was found to converge in prac-
Sil tically all cases tried. As was pointed out in section 2, the derivatives of the
optical constants with respect to reflectances and transmission increase
with decreasing ratio of film thickness to wavelength of incident radiation.
This causes the convergence to be slower for infrared radiation than for
visible radiation. In section 4 it is pointed out that very good first estimates
can usually be calculated for the infrared, but not for the visible. The suc-
cessive approximation method has worked successfully in both the visible

4. Approximations and first estimates. Harris and Loeb [3] have ie
veloped approximate equations for the optical constants as functions of
the observed reflectance and transmission. The assumptions made In de-
riving these approximations were that the metal film thickness is very small
compared to the wavelength of the incident radiation, and that the index
of refraction 18 approximately equal to unity. The  COTACY of the ap-
i equations was tested on Whirlwind 1 by calculating with the
is sm a , constants corresponding to an observed
constants thus found rs o transmission, and by transforming the

a reflectance and transmission using the exact

equations (1) through (7). The agreement between the values of reflectance
and transmission thus found and those observed is a measure of the re-
liability of the approximate equations. The approximate equations were
found to give accurate results for infrared radiation. For visible radiation
they are not usually valid.

While Whirlwind I has been useful for checking the validity of the ap-
proximations, it has proven indispensable for the evaluation of large num-
bers of observations made with visible radiation. Since this evaluation
consists of a series of successive approximations, first estimates of the op-
tical constants must be supplied. Sometimes the optical constants of solid
metals, as reported in the literature, are available to be used as first esti-
mates for the constants of metal films. When such values are not available,
the approximate equations are used to give at least first estimates of the
constants in the visible wavelength region.

In section 2 it was pointed out that the solutions for the optical con-
stants are double valued. The approximate equations developed for the
‘nfrared can be used to obtain first estimates to both sets of optical con-

stants.

5. The Whirlwind computer. The Whirlwind I computer is a high-speed,
parallel-type digital computer with a 16 binary digit register length (equiv-
alent to about 4.5 decimal digits). It is a fixed-point machine (all numbers
lie between —1 and +1), with a single-address order code which includes
the usual arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, di-
vision, etc.) and logical operations such as conditional and unconditional
transfers of control, shifting, extraction, etc. The average time required to
bring one number from the memory, multiply it by another number in the
memory, and transfer the result to memory (which includes the time re-
quired to bring these three instructions from the memory) is 88 micro-
seconds. The high-speed memory (whose access time is about 8 micro-
seconds) consists of 2016 registers of magnetic cores, and both magnetic
drums and tape provide auxiliary storage. Direct output of results is pro-
vided by a Flexowriter* connected to and controlled by the computer. A
faster system for output (in terms of computer time) is provided by storage
of output information on magnetic tape and the later reading and printing
of this information independently of the computer. The fundamental
method of input is from punched paper tapes (in either binary or Flexo-
writer code), and such tapes are normally read into the computer memory
via a photoelectric tape reader.

The restrictions imposed on the program
tions and short numbers of the W hirlwind com

mer by the fixed-point opera-
puter have been removed by

tric typewriter, paper tape punch, and paper

derivatives. Therefore, the machine must keep track of the required opera-
tion that is to follow each performance of the main program. The direct-
ing counter consists of a sequence of orders and two control registers whose
sign digits are examined. These sign digits are changed each time the
directing counter is referred to, so that the control registers have succes
sively the following signs: (++), (+—), (= ~), (— +), (++), ete. The
directing counter thus enables the machine to obtain directions after per

instructions and constants are therefore put on one tape, the “program
tape”, the experimental data on other tapes, called “parameter tapes.”
The program tape (or tapes, as explained in section 8) is read in first. Sub-
sequently a set of data is read in from the parameter tape. Both types of
tapes are prepared by typing the information on a Flexowriter in accord-
ance with the conventions of the Comprehensive System.

Experimental data can be recorded on specially prepared forms. A
mask can be fitted over any such form so that only the recorded numbers
are visible through the windows. Next to the windows are the register
addresses appropriate to each experimental parameter so that the experi-
mental data can easily be recorded on a parameter tape. The parameters
punched out on the parameter tape are: the index of refraction of the
backing, n,, the thickness of the metal film, a, the wavelength of the
incident radiation, A, the measured reflectances, RK, and R; , and transmis-
sion of the film, 7 , and, if available first estimates of the optical constants
of the films. Each set of parameters is followed by information causing
the program to start at either point A or point B.

8. Modes of operation. For a flexible application of Whirlwind I to
problems of thin metal films, six modes of operation have been programmed.
The principal program tape contains the information necessary for the
performance of the iterative procedure described in section 6. One mode,
using starting point A, takes the first estimates supplied with the data on
the parameter tape, and improves on these until they fit the experimental
data. Two additional modes, both starting at point B, make use of the
approximate equations to obtain the two sets of solutions when no first
estimates are supplied. Use of the principal program tape produces one
set of optical constants, while a short auxiliary program tape modifies the
program on the principal tape so that the other set is produced. (When
first estimates are supplied with the data, only the set of constants closest
to the first estimates is produced.)

The remaining three modes are used to test first estimates without

~ attempting to improve on these estimates (see section 4). For this purpose

a second short auxiliary tape is used in all three test modes which modifies
the principal program in such a way that only one iteration is performed.
The first of these test modes, starting at A, transforms a given set of
optical constants into a set of reflectances and transmission. The last two
modes, starting at B, use the approximate equations to obtain a set of
optical constants; this set is then transformed into a set of reflectances and
transmission. The first auxiliary program tape is again used to obtain one
or the other of the two possible solutions.

9. Operation. The computer performs two distinct tasks during the
operation of the program:

 

DIGITAL COMPUTER AS A LABORATORY TOOL 13

A. Reading information from a tape and storing this information in the
gorage registers indicated on the tape.

B. Examining the instructions in the storage registers and carrying out
these instructions.

The reading and storing is done through a read-in program stored in the
computer. It 1s possible to alternate the two tasks by means of two features:

1. An order in the principal program can shift control to the read-in
program. This order occurs after the results for film incidence and backing
incidence have been printed out, so that the next set of experimental data
on the parameter tape can be read in automatically. When there is no
more paper tape in the photoelectric tape reader, the computer stops.

2. On a tape, the start information causes the read-in program to cease.
Control is then transferred to the principal program as explained above.

The operation of the program is as follows: First, the principal program
tape is placed in the reader and when it is partially read in, control is
transferred to that portion of the program just read in, so that the com-
puter types the column headings (see Table 1). As soon as these headings
are printed, control is again transferred to the read-in program to read in
the remainder of this program tape. When this is done the computer
stops; other requested program tapes are read in and the parameter tape
is placed in the reader. As soon as the first set of data on the parameter
tape is read in, the start information which occurs at the end of this set of
data shifts control to the programs outlined in section 8; the computer then
performs the indicated tasks and prints out the results. The last order of
this program shifts control back to the read-in program so that the next
set of data is read in automatically without another stop (see next para-
graph). The start information at the end of the second set of data shifts
control back to the computation. This cycle of read-in, compute, print-

out, read-in, compute, ete. continues automatically until no more informa-

tion is left on the parameter tape. | | a

Following a tape read-in, the computer can either start computing oy 0-
art button is pressed, depending on the position
switch. Since at least two tapes are to be read
omputer stops after each program ie

10. Results. Table 1 shows the results obtained for a set of data reported
by Krautkrimer [5]. The first two digits of the sample number indicate
the source of experimental data. The quantities dR and dT give the differ-
ence between the final values of R and T calculated and those supplied
with the data. These quantities are less than experimental error except
when an X is printed at the beginning of a line of results. This X indicates
that either the first estimate was very poor or that the approximation
procedure converged so slowly that more than a certain prearranged num-
ber of approximations is necessary. The results printed out following the X
are the intermediate results obtained after the required number of itera-
tions has been performed. The maximum number of iterations allowed is
a number which can be assigned on the parameter tape for each set of
data. This feature is a safety device which prevents loss of computer time
due to bad estimates or lack of convergence, and which enables the pro-
grammer to have a look at intermediate results when convergence is slow.
The derivatives indicate the error in n and k due to experimental error in
R and T. The last columns give the film conductance and dielectric con-
stant computed from the optical constants [3].

To check the correctness of the program a number of samples were
evaluated by desk calculator and by Whirlwind I; the results agreed. The
time ratio is about 5000 to 1, and the reliability of Whirlwind I, once the
program has been checked, far greater than that of a human computer.
In order to check the convergence, a sample was run with progressively
worse first estimates. In this series of timed calculations, about 9 seconds
were required when the first estimates for n and k differed by less than 10 %
from the correct values, while only about twice as much time was required
for a first estimate of » and k differing by about 50% from the correct
values.

The results of these computations have been studied (2, 3], and have led
to an estimate of the relaxation time of electrons in various metal films
(bright as well as black). The double valuedness of the solutions has been
demonstrated, and it was discovered that curves for the optical constants
previously reported as being single valued were actually combinations of
portions of the two branches of the double valued functions.

11. Applications. The use of Whirlwind I has been twofold. On the one
hand this computer has been instrumental in the evaluation of large
quantities of experimental data, while on the other hand the ease of per-
forming otherwise formidable calculations led to the discovery of various
relations and approximations, and to the proof that some assumptions
previously used for thin films [3] are actually not valid. Over 250 sets of
measurements have been evaluated on Whirlwind I, about 150 of these
with four different film densities. Not only would these calculations have

eed at the same low rate. Wi Minhas wold wil iw
to procee rate. With the Whirlwind I program available
however, further computations on systems consisting of a thin absorbin
film on a thick non-absorbing backing, with radiation incident dl
can be carried out very quickly and automatically.
| Some means of facilitating handling the data have been devised for
inclusion when more important changes are made in the program (see
next paragraph). In the current procedure the absence of data for backing
incidence must be indicated with each set of data on the parameter tape.
This 1S necessary because even though the program tape contains a nega-
tive value for the backing reflectance R’, the value of R’ stored in the com-
puter memory is always that most recently read in from the parameter
tape. The program will be changed so that after calculations for positive
R’ have been completed, the contents of the register reserved for R’ are
made negative. Then no information about R’ is required on the parameter
tape except when a value for R’ is included with the data. The absence of
first estimates for the optical constants, now indicated by the start informa-
tion on the parameter tape, might be handled similarly, so that the program
always starts at the same point and control is then transferred to either
point A or point B.

The present program should be expanded to include more complicated
physical systems, generally a number of regions, each characterized by a
thickness and two optical constants, separated from each other by a
number of parallel interfaces. Equations (1) to (7) were derived by solving
Maxwell’s equations with appropriate boundary conditions at the inter-
faces. These boundary conditions lead to a set of simultaneous, algebraic
equations, two per interface, for the electric and magnetic field vectors. It
will probably be advantageous to have the computer solve these equations,
thus computing reflections and transmission directly from Maxwell’s
equation. This would then provide a more general main program (see
Fig. 3); otherwise the applications would not be different from the ones
described in this paper. Since the arithmetic operations have to be per-
formed on complex numbers, it might be desirable to develop a Compre-
hensive System for complex numbers similar to that used for double-
length numbers (see section 5).

The authors express their deep appreciation for the guidance and en-
couragement received from Professor Louis Harris, and for the technical
assistance from the staff of the Digital Computer Laboratory. Thanks are
also due Mr. Jack D. Porter for his helpful suggestions, and Miss Janice
K. Richmond for her assistance in processing the data. Digital Computer
Laboratory time for this problem was made available by the Office of

Naval Research.
