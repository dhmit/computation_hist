primative e.lement of Ga, ie., Ao = [AP]"[BO]™ where (n, m) = 1, according to
the recursion formulas in §5. Conversely, the only generating matrices mapping
onto A, are of the form K 'AK". To see this, note that the primitive elements of
Ga are precisely those that are associated with another element B. in such a way
that the pair [4, , Bq| forms a basis of the group, or in terms of Figure 3, so that
[-h., B.] forms a period parallelogram in the u-plane. (The element B, can con-
veniently be chosen as the image of the B that is paired as a generator with A4).
'lfhis period parallelogram, regardless of the exact choice of B, , has A, as one
Slc.le, and to it, under the mapping (9.1), correspond infinitely many well-deter-
mined quadrilateral fundamental domains in the z-plane. But by the definition
of generating matrix we must select only those with « as a vertex. They are all
related to one another by the translations z — X' Hence letting A* denote
some one of the matrices K ‘AK" we find that the corresponding quadrilateral
A fundamental domain must contain a side w »*". This determines the fraction
(i =)ai1/a3 , which in turn determines the matrix A* completely ; since
