Minutes of the Sixth Meeting of the
Coummittee on kachine Methods of Computation . =@

personnel to teach it needed to be settled before one could de-
lineate in more detall what the course should contain.

The Committee next turned to contracts. It was agreed that,
implicitly or explicitly, contracts should containprovisions for
the support of educational ectivities &nd research., Tnese should
be flexible. The contract for Whirlwind was discussed. Here the
Government contributes the major fraction of its support. The
understanding is that the meachine would be avalilable nalf-time for
educational activities, although it is not explicitly stated in
the contract what tae actual time fraction is. The contracting
egency has, at times, brougat in outside &s well as inside groups
who nave an interest in using the machlnes for calculations. These
were generally sclentiflc in nature, thougn not all were in this
category. The use of machines by members of the Institute working
on other contracts for the Government was discussed. It was felt
that 1f the problem 1s of & fundemental scientific nature this
should be included in the category of machine time for educational
and scientific research. On the other hand, it was felt that no
contract at the Institute should be drawn which depended on the
essential existence of a machine wlthout further discussion.

The next meeting will be January 10, at 9:30 A.i., in Room
6-109. The above discussion will be continued, and, in addition,
the program for the Computation Seminar for next term will be
considered.
