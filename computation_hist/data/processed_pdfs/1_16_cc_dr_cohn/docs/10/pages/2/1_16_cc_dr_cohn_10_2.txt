A PERIODIC ALGORITHM FOR CUBIC FORMS II.*

By HARVEY Conn.

 

15. Introduction to Part II. . In this continuation of our discussion
of a cubic sign-discrimination algmthm: introduced in an earlier volume of
this JOURNAL [’7], we shall turn our attention to the computation of Units.

First of all we shall show (leaning 01109 "101‘: 0H- the Miukowskian
algorithm) that all units are discoverable by the neighbor process” of
pm 1 ['7]’ pp, 829-833. In so doing we must restrict our lattice to a module
972 of preferably (but not necessarily) all integers in a totally real cubic ﬁeld
5?. The ﬁeld 8? need not be abelian but the module EUt must be non-singular
(i. e., of dimension three over the rationals). The units would then lie in D
the order of the module Slit.

Secondly we shall consider the manner in which the units should be
written. As we observed in [7], p. 833 Certain 3 X 4 matrices are propor—
tional only under certain rearrangements of rows and columns This makes
it desirable to have a hypercomplcx notation, which also brings out normal
symmetries of the matrices.

In comparing our modiﬁed algorithm with its Minkowskian Progenitor
we start with the realization that What We are doing is reﬁning the algebraic
properties of the algorithm at the expense of the geometric properties, but
the algebraic simpliﬁcations make numerical work 1 more feasible while the
geometric complications make themselves felt only in existence type proofs
which are disposed of here. This dichotomy is illustrated in the geometric

and algebraic portions of the present work.
Existence of Units.

16. Types of neighbors. We consider a reduced matrix 4, in the sense
of 4 (above) consisting of four column vectors which we shall write as

We shall classify the 24: neighbor possibilities (explained in 10 above) into
three types depending on the partition of the symbols serving as second and

third element in the neighbor operation:
Type 1 Type 2 Type 3

(ESP), (SEQ) (ESQ).- (SRP) (953); (391’)

LEMMA. Every reduced metric; ¢ has either one or two (reduced)
neighbors of each type.

Outline of Proof. We must consider the subdivision into cases as deter»
mined by the relative magnitudes of each row: (i p41, l q, l, (T, l, l 3‘ l),
(compare 11) There are actually twenty-four diﬁ'erent cases (to within
elementary interchanges of rows and columns and changes of sign in rows).
The details are omitted in the interests of brevity we simply remark that
this method was used in the (weaker) statement made earlier ['7], p. 830
that there are from three to six neighbors.

17. Occurrence of independent units. The units deduced from the
)Iinkowskian algorithm were “controllable” in the sense that if we take a
succession of neighbors to one Minkowskian triple by “lowering the'same
face ” (say 1'.) each time we would obtain a unit whose {I}; conjugate is less «
than unity and Whose other conjugates are greater than unity in absolute
value. If units are formed corresponding to two different a. they are inde-
pendent by the classical argument of Dirichlet.

The same thing can be done here, except that the
