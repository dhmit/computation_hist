Subject: STATUS OF M.I.T:'S EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM IN AUTOMATIC COMPUTATION
Date: June 1, 1954

As a matter of record in connection with the Wayne University Conference
on Training Personnel for the Computing Machine Field, June 22 and 23, 1954,
we have assembled, largely from the M.I.T. catalogue, some information about
various M.I.T. educational activities in the field of automatic computation.

Most of the departments in the Institute are actively interested in
automatic computation as a tool to be taught as an adjunct to other subjects
and to be used in individual research work.

To coordinate Institute activity in the field, the Institute has an
interdepartmental Committee on Machine Methods of Computation comprising
P.M. Morse, chairmen, and H. Feshbach (Physics), C.C. Lin and F.B. Hildebrand
(Mathematics), S.H. Caldwell and J.W. Forrester (Electrical Engineering),
and J.A. Hrones (Mechenical Engineering).

To stimulate research by faculty and students, there are a number of
sponsored research projects bearing on automatic computation, notably in
the Digital Computer Laboratory and the Dynamic Analysis and Control Labor-
atory.

Financial support is available to promising graduate students in any
department through the Committee on Machine Methods of Computation under the
sponsorship of the Office of Naval Research, and in some departments (e.g.
Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Physics, Mathematics,
Geology, Business) in connection with the various sponsored research pro-
jects. Scholarship and fellowship is available as for all students.

Laboratory exercises and thesis research projects requiring computing
equipment make use of the facilities described in the following page, which
includes only those facilities which are available at least part time for
unsponsored educational purposes.

Besides thesis research at all levels, informal weekly seminars, and the
short lectures and demonstrations. which are increasingly being incorporated
into undergraduate and graduate subjects in various departments, M.I.T. has
a number of subjects specifically concerned with machine computation and, of
course, many which pertain to computation in one way or another. Catalogue
listings of most of these subjects are given on the remaining pages of this
note. M.I.T. subjects are numbered with a department number followed by
some serial number (e.g., 6.25 is in Course VI - Electrical Engineering)
where the code is: 2 = Mechanical Engineering; 6 = Electrical Engineering;
8 = Physics; 10 = Chemical Engineering; 16 = Aeronautical Engineering; M =
Mathematics. Credit hours are given for class hours, laboratory hours, and
preparation hours, listed separately in that order]

COMPUTING FACILITIES

 

Analog Equipment

A number of small installations of analog equipment of the Philbrick
type are available for educational teaching and research in various de-
partments. There are two separate installations of REAC equipment, a single=-
unit REAC in the Servomechanisms Laboratory and a double-unit REAC with
extensive input-output equipment in the Instrumentation Laboratory. A very
large analyzer is available in the Dynamic Analysis and Control Laboratory,
largely for sponsored research.

Punched-Card Equipment

A fairly complete installation of punched-card equipment is available
in the Office of Statistical Services. The usual line of auxiliary machines
are represented: Type 024, 026 Card Punches, Verifiers, Type 075, 080 and
082 Sorters, Type 513 and 514 Reproducing Punches, Type 077 Collators, Type
402 and 403 Accounting Machines, Type 604 Electronic Calculator, and a Card
Programmed Calculator. This equipment is used for scientific computing,
student instruction, and M.I.T. business. A type 650 Magnetic Drum Calcul-
ator has been ordered and will be available in 1955.

Large Digital Equipment

In addition to the various IBM equipment just listed, the Whirlwind I
computer in the Digital Computer Laboratory is available part-time for ed-
ucational work under O.N.R. sponsorship. This machine is a 35,000 oper=-
ations/second parallel binary machine with magnetic core storage for 2048
16-bit words plus 32,768 words of drum storage, and various input-output
equipment. For both classroom and research work, various automatic coding
routines are available to make the Whirlwind I computer behave as if its
basic word were longer, decimal, and even floating-point.
