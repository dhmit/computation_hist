The task order for this perlod would include the usval Whirlwind
project activities:

1. Research in methods of numerlical analysis and
the formulation of sclentific problems for machine
solution, together with the training of personnel
in thegse methods.

2., Support of the Sclentific and Engineering Applica-

It is anticlÔ¨Åated that a separate project will be set
up to handle the Type 704 utilization within the MIT Computation
Center, and a separate request to the ONR for support of this work
will be made in the near future. In this respect certein
experienced programmers could be made available for tranafer to
