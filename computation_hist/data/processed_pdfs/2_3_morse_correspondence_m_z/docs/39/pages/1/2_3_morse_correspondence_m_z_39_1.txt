This letter in to put in writing the position
or the computation Center on the m 650, now rented by
the Office of Statistical Services. Under the present
"ground rules”, as outlined by Dr. Shade:- severel nenthe
ego and again by you three weeks ago, we do not see hm!
the Center can take on the equipmnt. It would mean a.
"double standard" operation, which would be dangerous to
our initial operation.

Perhaps, next spring, we can re-emine the
matter again. and see whether, in the light or our experi-
ence, either we, or you, should change our "ground rules".
And we are keeping space for the 650 in the Center. in case
the rules should be changed.

But at present I can only reiterate what I told
Dre. Shade: and Hunter last March, and you last month,
that the Center cannot take the 650 under the present
rules laid down by IBM. You should discuss with Mr.
Gusick, who is in charge of the Office of Statistical
Servieee, when it should be removed.

Sincerely ,

Philip 14. Horse
