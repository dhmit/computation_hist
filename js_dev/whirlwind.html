<h1>Magnetic Core Memory</h1>
<p>Unlike the computers that came before the Whirlwind, the Whirlwind did not use vacuum tubes
    to store information. Vacuum tubes were able to store bits in 0 and 1; however, the vacuum
    tubes were prone to breakage and wore out quite frequently. To overcome this problem, Jay
    Forrester, the lead scientist behind the creation and design of the Whirlwind, created the
    magnetic core memory system. The magnetic core memory system used a grid of magnets to store
    information in bits based on the direction of the polarity of the magnets. The system was
    successful and was utilized until the creation of modern-day RAM in the 70s.</p>

<p>The following is a converter to convert numbers into binary numbers. Binary numbers would be
    what was stored on the magnetic core memory system.<p>

<button id="butt_0" value="0">0</button>
<button id="butt_1" value="1">1</button>
<button id="butt_2" value="2">2</button>
<button id="butt_3" value="3">3</button>
<button id="butt_4" value="4">4</button>
<button id="butt_5" value="5">5</button>
<button id="butt_6" value="6">6</button>
<button id="butt_7" value="7">7</button>
<button id="butt_8" value="8">8</button>
<button id="butt_9" value="9">9</button>

<button id="store" >Store</button>

<button id="reset" >Reset</button>

<p>The current number is:</p>
<p id="cur_num">
</p>
<p>The binary form of the number is:</p>

<p id="bin_num"></p>
