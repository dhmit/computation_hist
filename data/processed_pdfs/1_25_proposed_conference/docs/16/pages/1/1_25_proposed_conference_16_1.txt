Dear Phil,

I am enclosing the material prepared by 5 chairmen
and sent to me in manuscript. The material from the rapporteurs
in Chicago has not yet reached me. I am sending copies of the
enclosed to each of the 5 chairmen.

We have magnetic tapes of the whole proceedings and
should be able to fill in gaps if needed. I thought we might
wait until the reports from Chicago came in.

Please let me know if and when you would like me to
come and see you.

Sincerely yours,
