In respect to the conversations with the Fedgﬁg; Reserve

an sure that 30114111). be relieved that I have ‘ﬁereuduee the
Computation Center people to take over this chore and Frank
Vernal: will prebably do it. However, we would like to reaf-
fira the invitation to you to take lunch ﬂth this group in
dining room 3 at 12:00 :1. together with Ralph Freeman as host
end one or {me other colleagues. .

Whether or not “701;" will be ready to show off by that time
we cannot now predict, but in any case it eeem appropriate
that the Computation Center people who are charged with
needling the economists into the appreciation of the uses at
“7014.“ should carry the ball on this occasion.

The Registry of Guest. has been mapletely 'at eon 1n the whole
nutter and has net yet found eut from Mr. Dickson the nature
or the precise number or who in coming and why.

Sincerely yours.
