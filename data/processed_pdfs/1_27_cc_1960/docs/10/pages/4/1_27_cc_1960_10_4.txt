the experiment or the scientist can 6 on to the next step and
request the next computation in tura. On the 704 this would
reguire the exclusive use of the machine, though only a-fractlon'
of the 704 speed would be used; obvmously again, time=-sharing
techniques are needed,

These, and many other brograms now in progress, such as
the character-recognition St e S . 4 the research
on ecenomic forecasting end on operational behavior using large=-
scale simulation technigues, should be of particular interest to
LB, for they have direct bearing on the progress of computer
design and utilization, They represent the sort of cooperative
research between experts in different fields which KIT does so
effectively, and they involve the combination of research and
education for which [IT is pre=eminent. This work deserves
support by IBii, in addition %o the educational activities which |
are already being SHPPOLt?%43? the present concrlbut;on of the 704,
They can most eiloctlvelyﬂbg che installation of a 7090, replacing
the 704, in the near future; ULIT will then be able to provide
the staff and ancwl7ary equipment to push ahead with dispatch.,.
Because of the "inter-connectedness" of much of this research,
it can best be carried out (perhaps it can only be carried out)
in the atmosphere of mutual cooperation aad exchange of infor-
mation provided by the Computation Ceter,
