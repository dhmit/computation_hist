Dear Ray:

I enclose coples of part of the first draft of
our first Progress Report. Final copies will be sent to
NSF, but they may not get to you in time to use in your
talk, so I am sending you these. They probably will be
changed some in the final copy, but they should give you
the general picture.

I am trying to get pictures of the machine room
taken this week; the machines were put in place last week.
If they can be taken soon, I'll send you some prints, from

which I hope you can get some slides!

yours,

Philip M. Morse
