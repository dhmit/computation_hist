2 In enclosing s copy of a memo describing our
tiueashsring subscription line proposal, I copy of our memo
to the H.I.T. Audit Division describing our tine-Accounting
procedures, end s requisition tron Records Processing and
studies for one double rste tine-shoring line. Since the
whole ides of selling computer service is quite new to us,’
I on not sure what the proper procedures are. I hope that
this requisition end these memorands, with the further note
that the socounoing transfers should he to account 1633, is
sufficient to get all the machinery in motion. 1

At the end of such month I will send you, or
whomever you design-ts, A copy of the computer time used by
Records Processing and Studies, or any future subscribers,
in a form which, I hope, you will be able to use for billing.
The subscribers themselves will also get a copy of this
report.

If there seems to be anything we are not doing
according to Institute rules or something we are doing that
won't work, would you please let me know as soon as possible.
As a matter or teem, if we seem to be doing things right, I
would appreciate hearing that also. Thank you for your help
in this matter. '

Yours truly,

J.R. Steinberg
