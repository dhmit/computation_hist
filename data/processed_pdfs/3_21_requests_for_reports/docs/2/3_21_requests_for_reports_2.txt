Dear Professor Morse,

till October of last year I was working at the Technische
Hochschule Hannover, You have had the kindness to cause
the reports about "Research and Educational Activities"

of the Computation Centre to be sent to the above address.
Now I am working at the University of Bonn in the Institute
of Applied Mathematics and I would be very grateful if you

would have the forthcomming reports sent to this new address.

My best thanks in advance and with kind regards.

Yours sincerely
