2. All binary cards should be in column binary format.
5. Input/Output operations be done in'programslby
standard subprograms and not be detéiled machine coding.

4. The use of Sense Switches should be avoided in FMS
programs inasmuch as there is no provision. for setting the
switches for each job in a Monitor run. In addition, the
Monitor utilizes sense switch 6; the Center expects to -
utilize sense switches 4 and 5 for on-line output control.

A programmer can easily simulate sense switches by reading
in a pseudo-sense switch data card immediately after starting
his run.

5. Programs and data should read-in from off-line
recorded magnetic tape and results should be read-out for
off-line printing or punching. The use of the on-1line printer
and punch should be avoided whenever possible. In the FMS
System sﬁecial versions of the off-line BCD tape writing
subprogram will be provided such that when sense switch 4 is
depfessed, the tape writing will be monitored at the on-1line
printer. Similarly off-line binary tape writing will be
monitored at the on-line punch when sense switch 5 is depressed.
Thus there should be no need for programming on-line output
since 1if the programmer is present, he can have the option.

6. Batches of program-produced off-line punched output
should be terminated by an end-of-file and preceded by two
blank cards and identifying cards punched in block letters.
(Subprograms for this purpose will be provided.)
