research design. This person would undertake broad research
and planning in transportation, land use, and metropolitan -
function., For the first six months or so of his time in

phia where he would assist in programing and research
?}annlng in such a way as to become widely accuainted with
tne work going forward at PJ, Thereafiter he would supervise
the data collection and research asmects of a counter%art*
study to PJ in Wilmington, attemptiﬁg to bring data fgf the
wilmington Standard Metropolitan Statistical Irea up to tﬁe
level attained by PJ. :
