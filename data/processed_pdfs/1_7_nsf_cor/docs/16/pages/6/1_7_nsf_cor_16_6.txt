group in the new Computation Center. He obtained his B.S. in
Electrical Engineering at Michigan, spent four years doing graduate
work in Mathematics at Purdue and is, at present, finishing his
doctor’'s thesis in Mathematics. He has had extensive experience

in The use of analogue computers, with conventional IBM equipment
and with Whirlwind I. His salary will be charged to the Project.

Frank M. Verzuh, who will be assistant director for
operations of the new Center, will also assist the Project. As
Director of Statistical Services at MIT since 1946, he has been
connected with the operation of MIT computational work since 1940,
In this capacity he has had considerable experilence with the
utilization of various analogue computing equipment--differential
analyzers, etc., as well as a complete line of digital machines
ranging from the IBM Type 601 through the Type 704. He received
a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of
Denver in 1940, a M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from MIT
in ‘1946, and a Sc.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from MIT in
1952. None of his salary will be charged to the Project.

In addition, the mewmbers of the MIT Machine Computation
Committee and of the Computation Center's Advisory Committee on
the cooperative program of the Center (see Appendix A) will be
available for advice and cooperation. From time to time, if one
of them can supervise a part of the Project, part of his salary may
be charged to the Project.

These will include some former members of the Whirlwind
programming research group, such as Frank Helwlg and Sheldon Best,
and others. Some of the best of the IBM research assistants at the
Center will be taken on the Project, for appropriate periods, at
full time, after they have finished thelr graduvate work and relinquished
their assistantships.
