Professor Philip M. Morse, Director
Computing Center

Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Cambridge, Massachusetts

Dear Professor Morse:

Almost two years have elapsed since we have had a nationwide
get together of University Computing Center Directors. This year we
are inviting you to participate in a seminar to be held in Endicott, New
York during the week of July 21, 1958, There has been a tremendous
expansion in university computing activities in the past two years and we
feel that a meeting of this kind would present an excellent opportunity to
discuss these developments and to explore on a collective basis the future
trends.

We want this meeting to be your meeting. That is, we would like
you, the Directors, to organize and run the meeting with IBM merely acting
as host, We have asked several of the Directors to serve as a committee to
organize this meeting and we would like you to communicate your suggestions
for an agenda directly to them. The committee is:

Dr. Thomas A. Keenan University of Rochester
Dr. William B. Kehl University of Pittsburgh
Dr. Alan J. Perlis Carnegie Institute of Technology

Enrollment for the seminar should be made through your IBM branch office.

We sincerely hope that you will be able to attend. The success of
this will, after all, depend on the extent of your participation both before
and during the meeting.

Sincerely yours,

Melvin A. Shader, Manager
IBM University and Research Institute Program
