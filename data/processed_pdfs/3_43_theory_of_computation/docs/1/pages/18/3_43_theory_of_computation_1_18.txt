which proves that (p-—>(q-—>a,b),(q->c,d)) and
(q-ﬁ-(p-ﬂ'a,c),(p->b,d)) are weakly equivalent,
They are also strongly equivalent, e shall
write EEES and -EETW for the relations of

Strong and weal equivalence.
There are two rules whereby an equivalence
can be used to generate other equivalences,
1. Ifd_:-—:—_g anda&l = B, is the
result of substituting any gbf for any variable
ineA = B thona<l P 1+ This is called
the rule or substitution,

D If oA = B and o is sub-expression of
% and & 1s the result of replacing an occurrence
ofin - by an occurrence of B -, theny-= g
This is calleq the rule of r'eplacement,

These rules are applicable to either strong
Or weak equivalence and in fact to nuch more
general situations, _

Weak equivalence corresponds more closely
to equivalence of truth functions in PYopositional
calculus than does strong equivalence,
