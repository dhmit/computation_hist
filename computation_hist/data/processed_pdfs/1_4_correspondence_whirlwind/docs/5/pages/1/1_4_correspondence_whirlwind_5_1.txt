SUBJECT: "Purchased" Time on the WW1 Computer during the eix—month

period July 1 - December 31, 1955.

 

In accordance with our discussions regarding ways and means
for financing the 131.13. Computation Center involving the
704 operation, I have prepared a four-page summary of "purchased"
time on the W1 Computer broken down on a project basis.

It should ice-mentioned that the charge for the use of this
computer £2,115 into a. number of categories:

1. Guaranteed time charged at sin-equivalent rate of
$3.205/hour of WW1 time.

2. Regular charge at a. rate of $4.167/hour of W11 time.

Tom Crane, Research Fiscal Officer, and I will meet to discuss
a possible revision of! the current billing procedure.

During this six-month period the "purchased time" usage of
WW1 breaks down as follows:
