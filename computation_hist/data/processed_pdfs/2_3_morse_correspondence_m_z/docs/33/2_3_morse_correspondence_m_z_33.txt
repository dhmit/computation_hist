Dear P .M.M. :

I trust you finally got home from Washington. My plane Just made it
to Laguardia as the weather closed in.

The Clebsh-Gordan picture looks rather grim. Say 1 and l' are to be
combined to give L. Then for given magnetic quantum numbers m and m'
as well as for a given 1 and 1‘ there are a total of

(1+l') —!m+m'l+1
possible L's. This expression must be summed on m:|m[s l, and m':

lm‘ls 1‘, and then summed on 1 and 1' from zero to some maximum value
which we wish to include in the table.

The leading term in the resultant sum goes as l5 (sob). A fractional
coefficient in front of this term can be gainedmg§ taking account of

the various symmetries of the C.-G.'s but this is immediately obliterated
as soon as you include half-integer angular momenta.

. : 9
Did I hear somebody say lmax 30.
Nick sends his warmest regards.

Sincerely,

P{on-»1

P.S. There exists a ”Numerical Table of the C.—G. Coefficients" by
Albert Simon, Oak Ridge: ORNL-lYlB, up to l=l'=9/2. This seems
good enough for most problems feasible without a high speed
computer.
