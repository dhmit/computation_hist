We recall that a lattice is said to be admaissible with respect to a conyey

body K (or vice versa) if no point of the lattice except the origin is interjg;
to K. The convex body which we use is the rectangular parallelopiped:

(3.1) P(éyé6): || = &

The lattice we use can be written as

(3.2) 2 = bimy + bisms - bisms, m;integral, 1, j =1,2,3,

Its determinant D is assumed == 0, and we henceforth make the simplifying
assumption that none of the components x,, x,, or x, shall vamsh for any
vector of the lattice except the origin. This fits in conveniently with the
intended application, where the triple (b, bis, bis) spans the totally red
cubic field K; (where the index ¢ denotes the conjugate).

We consider an ordered triple of lattice vectors (4;, 4., A4s), wher
4i= (29, 2,0, ,3). We call such a triple Minkowskian if P(z,", z,¢), 2,1)
is admissible. Such triples exist under very broad assumptions ([?]) and
fron.z Minkowski’s algorithm ([5]) such a triple is either co-planar 0r @
W'lwe basis. (The proof consists essentially, [4], of eliminating the possi-
bility that the triple generate a sub-lattice of ihd.ex 9. and this can be done
more s1:mply by the methods of 5 helow )
