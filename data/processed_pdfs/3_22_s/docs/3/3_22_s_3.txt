Mr. Stephen W. Sherman
2709 Spruce Avenue
West Palm Beach, Florida

Dear Mi, Sherman:

Your letter of July 15, 1963 to Professor P. M. Morse has
been referred to me for reply.

I gather from your letter that your main objective is to
do graduate work leading to a Master of Science degree and that you
would like a position at MIT which would contribute both financially
and professionally to this goal. The position that we can offer for
this objective is that of Research Assistant. It permits a graduate
student to register for two subjects per term and normally makes it
possible to complete a Master's program in two academic years. The
award of a research assistantship presupposes acceptance in the
Graduate School. Thus, the first step on your part is to apply for
admission to our Graduate School. I am requesting the Admissions
Office to mall to you an application form together with the General
Catalogue of the Institute. Offhand, I think that the Department of
Mathematics and the Department of Electrical Engineering are the most
appropriate choices for you. We do not have at this time a formal
program in communication sciences, although one could readily make
a selection of subjects which would amount to the same thing. I
believe that the Institute catalogue will answer most of your
questions. Please feel free to write to the department of your
choice or to me if you need further information.

Sincerely yours,

R. M. Fano,
RMF :ccs Ford Professor

of Engineering
