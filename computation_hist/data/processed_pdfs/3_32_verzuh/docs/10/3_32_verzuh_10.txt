This nsnorandu is prepared with tee objectives in ﬁnd. rirst.

, a brief historical background of the Rockefeller Differential Analyser
(RDA) is presented together with specific cements pertaining to the
develop-ant period and pertinent factors associated with its operation
during the past twelve years. Second, the recent di-antlinz and
disposition of the and is described in me detail. In the discussion
of the above itus, frequent reference will he ends to several nuns-ands
which have been prepared on the whine during the past decade.

1 think it is inportant that the locheieller Research roundatien
be properly inforaed of the disposition of the Differential Analyser
since they were so helpful with financial contributions during its "
fen-native years.

The original design and develop-out of the Differential Analyser
was initiated early in 1936, and several of the basic features of the
sschine were deter-lined at that tile. Specifically, the design of the
servo-echnnin: syst- which weansed to interconnect the conponsnts of
the aachine was developed during that period. This is aenticned sisply
to indicste that during recent years nose of the neintenance probleas
associated with the RDA were occasioned by the particular serve-echani-s
which were nployed. These were vintage 1936, and as such. were not .
coapetitive with postri‘orld Ier ll serwc-echanin design.

The original Center of Analysis was for-ally organised by Professor 3. a.
Caldwell in Jnly. 1939 with the aid of a grant of $30,000 fro- the Carnegie
Foundation. During its only, fol-native years, the Center existed largely
on grants froa the Rockefeller Foundation, Electrical lngineering Depart-rent.
and other sources: and it was not until 1942 that the RDA was finally placed
into operation. Beginning at that tine, the RDA provided a source of
financial revenue which assisted in the {emulation of a self—supporting
regine.

During 1941, the activities of the Center (under the direction of
B. Taylor) were expanded to include a large battery of desk calculators
and associated personnel who were well advanced in the use of numerical
analysin techniques. At that ties. the Center contained 3 principal types
of facilities:

1. The Differential Analyst facility consisting of 2 uchines:
a) the original G—Integrator Differential Analyser,

h) The new Rockefeller ls-lntegrator llectrmechsnical
Differential Analyser.


3. The ma Punched-Card Section,

3. The Hand Coupntin‘ Group (which oaployed desk calculatora
for computational pun-poles).

During the war yearn 1942-45, the at'aff of the Center waa increaaed
to ‘approxiaately 50 people. Because of the large voluae of war-tile.
coaputational activity (3-ahift operation. etc.), thia aelf supporting
type of operation resulted in the creation of a financial reaerve fund
of over $40,000. '

. Profeeaor S. H. Caldwell returned fra hie me min-ant in 1945
and again aeeuaed hie for-er position as active Director of the Center.
The poet-ear years 1946-47 had a mutating effect on the prewiouelr
aontioned financial reeorwe. The eolue of coaputational work woe aharply
curtailed during thie period, but the operating staff of the Center wan
not aaterially reduced. Aa a consequence, the two-year period 1948-49
mo wary trying yeare frat the financial atondpoint; and during thie
period. the II Group and the Band Cuputing Group were separated frn the
center.

In larch, 1948, I. ll. Versuh wne placed in charge of the punched-
card am. After a period of reorganization it appeared that the loea
of one of the principal clienta of tho Ill aervicea, the A. 1). Little
Coapany, would create a eerioue operating deficit in the pinched-card
aoction. Aa n molt, a deciaion was node to diacontinue the pinched-card
section, and a letter terminating the exieting 13! machine rental contract
waa aent to the In Corp. in May, 1949. Fortunately, nr. Strattou learned
of the situation in tine to prevent dissolution of the “up. and at hie
direction, the 1m punched-card facility was reactivated on July 1, 1949. and
the group began operation an o aeparate coaputing facility under n.1.c.
eponaorahip. Finally, on July 1. 1950, the Adainiatratiun not up the In!
group as on Adainietrative Office - the Office of Statistical Servieea.

It alao hecane apparent that the original e—lntegrator Differential
Analyzer wao no longer required at IJJ. , and coneequently it waa pre-
sented to Wayne Univeraity in July, 1949 where it in still in operation.
Early in 1949 the Differential Analyser Group (the laat remaining aection
of the Center of Analysis) was about to he dissolved hecnuae of financial
difficulties. Fortunately. in June, 1949, a contract was initiated with the
u. 8. Air Force: which provided tho necessary financial neoietance needed
to continue its operation. In July. 1949, 1!. II. Veranh was alao placed in
in charge of the am group and one faced with the prohlu of hiring a new
operating staff. (The former group of Hansen. .3. L. c. 132, n. Hora-h,
G. Kunatedt, M. Costa, etc. had been released.)

A new operating staff consisting of honors. J. I. ﬂu, and E. *8.
Groaniaon were hired and trained, and the new NBA group consiating of

additions to the RDA:

W :0. 1950. However, it becane apparent prior to July 1, 1950 that
the operation of the Difierential Analner would again be in financial dit-
tionlty. Counmtly, the Institute decided to clone down the Differential
MM on of June 30, 1950. Again the operating eteif woe releaeed. and
the I. I. neperhent per-nontly covered all mponeibility tor the Diﬂerential
Analner. m nochine woe about to be mapped when Dr. Drape, Director o! the

facility, ho indintod that the Instruentation 'Laboratory would earl-o full
responsibility for all RM operation on noon on the exioting Air Force Contract

At thin tine. it wa- roalixed that the principal maggot“ work on
tho Alc contract was confined to the operational ate“ and not to the m
lachine Shop. Consequently. the responsibilities of the RDA Shop were trana—
Ierred to tho lnotruhntation Laboratory on Jilly l, 1950.6 In thia nonmr,
tho thorotory was able to utilize tho service- or the 3 Instrument Intern

Bept-her. 1950, the operating stat! of the RDA was engaged in the conpletion
or work requested by wright Field, the preparation oi final technical reports
required mac:- this contract, and the cnplotion of outstanding Center of
Analysis connitnents requiring the me of. the RDA. Hence. it was not} until
October 1, 1950 that the Instrumentation Laboratory nomad tho reoponoihility
of the operation of the entire RDA facilitz.

At this time. 3‘. E5. Verso): agreed to supervise the operation or the RDA
for the Inotn-entotion Laboratory. Since the Electrical Engineering Depart-
Ient staff assigned to this project had hemreaasignod to other projects within
the I. B. Depot-mat, effectiva July I, 1950, (Professor 3. E. Caldwell. J.

I. Ben. and H. P. Grossmon), it again became necessary to hire a now operating
staff. Two new man (Messrs. I. Ptoifer and R. Frodrickson) wore hired and
trained in the techniques or the 12m operation, and in eevceral nontho they
were able to effectively utilize the RDA for the solution of Inntrnnentation
Laboratory prawns.

3. 0 Immune “DJ—ALEX UTILIZATION 01‘ m RDA

 

The Instrulentetion Laboratory expressed s desire to ensue the res-
ponsihility tor IDA Operation in order that it night ceny on design end
.oelihretion stuiies for new couputing sights and e-unitiou which were under
current investigation in the Lehorstory. Further-ore, cert-in Instr-entetion
Laboratory contractual co—itnents were concerned with the denim-out o! is—

proved oouputin; sights, and the solution of associated hineeetic equations
required the use of the RDA.

'i‘he hhoretory felt that the RDA was unique in its deuonstreted cspehility
tor handling prohieee of that type. It was: he numbered that st that tile
(1950) the statue of present-day large-scale oc-puters was not where it is st

the present tine, and as e reeult, these oelihretion studies could be carried
out sore diectively on the mic; machine.

As it turned out, this was e not fortunate decision on the pert o! the
lnstmentetion Lshoretory since it resulted in the design of new lead couputing
lights which were used lost effectively in propeller end Jet cachet over Korea.

in this regurd. the Diiterentiel Anelyzer eguin node a host valueble contribution
to the war effort.

In the ueentine. however, there were continuous runhliuga in the becmoulld
concerning the renewal and disposition of the RDA. It was clearly realised thst
this uschine was indeed u very old computing eachine by existing standards. As

a result, lute in 1952. iuprwed types or digital computing nachines were obtained
(an, etc.) end certein prohieus formerly solved on the Analyzer were treas—

M__. tori-ed to the digital unchinee. Qurinx this period u deter-iced effort was nude

 

to diluete the porter-Luce a: the Analyzer both on en economic and ehxineeriﬁc“- '
hesis. As the perfoz-usuce of the Whirlwind Computer iuproved and lore inter—
pretive subroutines. conversion prop-ens, floating decinl subroutines, etc. were
lads nvailehle, it home increasingly apparent that a larger and larger portion
of the work done on the Diﬂorentill Analyzer could he handled on the digital
equipent. Furthermore, as the EDA increased in ago its uintemoe costs
naturslly increased. and since the digital iacilities had deﬁnitely beau-e part

of the ILLT. computational Most“, it beam apparent that serious consideretion
should he given-to the removal 01 the RDA. '

4.0 SURVEY ‘3‘ TBS APPLICATION OF THE DIFFERENTIAL ANALYZER

 

 

In retrospect, it is of interest to point out sous of the principal
contributions made by the Annlyzer during its 12—year life at 5.1.1. It
uust he reneahered, of. course, that its early applications were strongly in—
fluenced by World War II. Smigicallyv the machine was completed in 1942. and
since the applications during the period 1942—1945 were almost entirely of e

uiliterz, character. the following types of probleaa were solved (in none cases
thousands of tines):


1) Evaluation of ballistic tables,
2) Guided aissile stability and perforaance studies,
3) Lead cupnting sight calibration studies,
4) Studies of aircraft propeller perforaance equations,
5) Study of the design characteristics of suhnarinea, torpedoe,

and other underwater craft.
6) Study of the design of cat-aerate eeploying the hydrofoil principle.
1) Study of the operations research problea dealing with subarine warfare.
a) Study, design and performance of antisircraft nieeiles such as like. etc.

 

As a latterd fact, the contributions ends by the Analyzer were considered
to be sufficiently inportant that the Navy nepnrhent issued the Naval Ordnance
Developent Award in recognition of the work perforaed by the Differential Analysers
and associated cuputing staff.

in addition to such studies, the Analyzer was used to design new types of
lead coaputinz sights, tracking systue. aircraft cmponent design, etc. This type
of activity was carried on by the Inetrnaentation Laboratory during the years
1950-1954.

It is evident fro- the above partial list of problem: that the Analyser was
priurily need for the solution of nilitnry problus. however, there were a
nnaher of industrial problems-solved on this aoohine. for exanple:

1) Study of the performance of a annex-charge,

2) Study of circuit solution of electrical networks,

3) Analysis of the dynsaic perforaance of servmechsnisaa.

_ 4) Studies associated with heat flow problus.

5) study of a problu in enayae kinetics, '

6) Studies of the atmospheric oscillation of the upper atlosphere,

1) Studies of' n homdary vslue problen associa‘tedeith the design of
an ultra centrifuge,

In addition to the above industrial problems. the aachine was used to a

liaited extent for the solution of acadenic probleae arising in ILLT. thesis
research. For ample,

1) Investigation of aircraft performance and control.

2) Investigation of the performance of aagnetic relay circuits,

3) Investigation of the stability of zyroscopes,

4) investigation of the orbit of dynaaically-loaded Journal bearings,
5) Investigation of statistically—loaded machine bearings.

6) Study of magnetic amplifiers,

1) Investigation of the rolling characteristics of ship lodele.

a) Study of 11.1.1. servonechaniens,

9) Study of differentiation with ele‘ents of the Differential Analyser,
10) Investigation of Schrodinger-H Have Equation.
ll) Bonneville power load allocation study.

It is evident from the above list of prohlens solved on the Differential
Analyzer that it was used predominantly for military and D, I. c. sponsored

'l‘hestudies concerned with the possible utilization of the dizitel sschines
such es the CPC end Ihi-rlwind. hsd progressed to such s stege that on Pehrusry
l, 1954 the Institute decided thst the Different“: Analyser should be closed

_ effective July 1, 1.954. Hence, in Fehrunryj'. the present operstiu stuff wee

notiﬁed of this decision in order that they night sshe other srrsngesents for

persousl soploynent. As e result, the operstion of the niiierrentisl Anslyser
wss terninsted on June 30, 1954.

During the spring end Inner nonths s certain snount o! negotistin; wss
carried on with various lducstionsl Institutions concerning the possible 'dis-
position of the eschine. Only the ”following Universities:

s) Northwestern University, Ivsnston, Illinois.
h) Purdue University, msyette,‘,lndisns.

c) University of Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh. Pa. ,
d) The University of Connecticut. Starts, Conn.

expressed s serious interest in the possible utilisation of portions of this
sschine. After several visits by representatives. etc. . it was nutuslly speed
thst Purdue University would tshe the major portion 01 the nechine. The running
Universities expressed an interest in only s mil part of the m.

Once it bees-e sppsrcnt that the RDA was not to he ruovod sud reinetslled
es s conplete working unit st some other location, plans were rspidly tornnlsted
for its ectusl renovsl. Specificsliy, euly in September, Dr. strstton srrenged
for en ILLT. sppropristion of $5000 (Operating Account 1979.431) to carer the
cost of raoving end disaantling oi the RDA. On August 17, 1954, Prof, G. 5..
Brown oriicielly notified various embers of the ILLT. faulty or the decision
to r-eve the RDA and naked then to express their interest in posoible use or
Isohine conponentn. Therefore, in spproxinstely six weeks n definite decision
wss ssde roger-ding the diatribution of the Analyzer. On October '4, s crew of
5 technicians begsn to dismantle the RDA.

Purdue University was given one-third of the RDA and other groups received the

it in well to enphesine that although the physical nechine cmponenta heve been

teeching. and research. Since severe]. o1 these groups ere nuns-e, certain
choice portione of the Anelyner were releeeed to the. in order thnt they night

serve es cherecteristic nuseu pieces iilustreting the ntete of art prevalent
on the RDA.

in addition to the ebove—eentioned educationel institutions, e considerable
amount of neehine coeponents, notably vecuuu tubes, resistors. relays, etc. were
donated to Bel-out High School. This equipent is to be used as pert oi the
Vocationel Training Progra- in radio and electronics which is being preeented
at the high school level. This contribution should achieve a very useful educa-
tional purpose.

I.I.T. RESEARCH moms

 

It is also evident from Table l thet e umber of l.I.'r. projects have
received cmponente iron the RDA. In oertein cuss. e.g. , Dynalic Anelysil
Control l'ebm-atm-y (DACL), Flight Control laborntory (ran), Servo-menin-
laboratory (me), Acoustics Lehoretory. etc. , the coeponents will be incor-
porated into other conputing nachinee. In other ceses, the equipment will be
used for graduate thesis research. This in largely true for all the equip-out
releeeed to various neebers of the Electrical end Aeronautic“ Engineering
Projects.

The renoval e! the am will naturally serve to release a nunhor 0! bays
of space in Building '1. Speciﬁcally, 2450 sq. ft. of spoco hove been released
as a result of the reaoval of the RDA The following breakdown indicates the
space involved:

 

8:! Area (5. 11:.)
7-303 (3) 700
7-30! (4) 1‘00
3-339 (1) 850
2450

l. s latter of fact, the aacbine shop vhich Ionsny occupied the two bays
in 7—303 has already been transierred to Ron 10—481 end the two bays in
7-309 are currently occupiod by tho Mucational council.

The mining 5 boys of space (1750 sq. it.) are to be occupied by the
Architecture Departuent. The receipt of this 2500 sq. it. of space should

> certainly help to slleviste their space require-en“.

mus ION

This l-orsndun contains sons of the facts associated with the r—ovsl oi
the RDA. A brie! description oi the historical background or the aaehino, a

survey of its applicstions, and disposition of various cuponcnts are described
in considersble detail.

A breakdown of the expenses incurred in this operation isgiven. and it
is of interest to note that only $2838. so was required to renovo this "200- -ton
giant" Iran. the 11.1.7. preaisos. Perhaps of equal interest is the root that it
only required tie-nan deys lover s 2-week period) to acoosplish this removal

it is hoped that this report contains sufficient information to properly
acknowledge the finsncisl "stance received iron the Rocktellor Research
roundstion. Further-ore, it should serve on 3 record of the disposition of the
equip-out contained on the nachine. in this regard. it is perhaps well to non-
tion that an entire poser plant facilities notably, power trensi'orners. s aotor
generator set. an air compressor, a precipitron unit, etc. . have boa given to
Buildings and Power for other ll. 1‘. use.

In closing. it is evident that the RDA has served u very useful purpose
in the institute. However, like all things, it hsd s linited lite and certsinly
had becue obsolete by existing standards of the large—scale conputing equip-out.
It is therefore only proper that it should be removed end that other nodern
conputing oquipaent be installed to serve in its place.
