Dear Dr. Weasel:

It is with s great deal of pleasure that I enclose our check
for $966. 50 representing the first semester portion of the stipend
for the IBM Research Associate recently appointed for the 1959 -60
school year in connection with the M. I. T. Computation Center. A
detailed description of the appointment is attached.

The increasing use of the IBM 704 Computer at M. I. T.
by the New England colleges both as an educational device and a.
research tool has been very encouraging to IBM. and we are
delighted that Tufts is having an active part in it as represented by
this research appointment.

Sincerely yours,

M. Loren Bullock
