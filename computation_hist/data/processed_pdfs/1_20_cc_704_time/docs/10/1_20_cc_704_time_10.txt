Dear Mr. Konig:

Your very kind letter of December 4 is at hand and we are
most pleased with your kind offer to provide us intermittent time on
your 704!

We have been operating Whirlwind on a very tight schedule for
a number of years, so I understand your scheduling problem one hundred
per cent and I repeat we feel very fortunate indeed that you even
consider allowing us to use it on this intermittent basis. I shall
contact your Mr. Locicero some time next week to determine a tentative
machine testing schedule,

Please understand that we very much appreciate your cooperation
and in turn I am certain that we will reciprocate in like kind as soon
as our 704 arrives.

Sincerely yours,

F. M. Verzuh
Assistant Director
MIT Computation Center
