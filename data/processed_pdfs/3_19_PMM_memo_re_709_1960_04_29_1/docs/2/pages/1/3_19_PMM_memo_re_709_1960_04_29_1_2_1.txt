Proposal for Development of a Real-Time Computation Facillty

Ob jective: The purpose of thls proposal is to obtain support
for the research and development of a feasible
real time (on-line) computation system, time
shared among many remote users. The system, cen-
tered around a large general purpose computer,
would be designed to meet the needs of a diverse
regsearch and educational activity; 1t would take
advantage of the possibilities of immedlate ac-
cess computation using speciallzed remote input-
output devices as an adjunct to human thought and
learning.

 

sSummary

Computers and computation systems have yet to explolt
many considerable advantages that may be realized with a very
closely coupled human reasoning - machine inf'ormation proces-
sing system. |

This 1s particularly the case 1ln very large information
processing problems such as large systems of non-linear par-
tial differential equations, heuristic programs, etc. where
properly applied human faclllitles of insight, pattern recog-
nition, reasoning, etc. may be the only feasible way of di-
recting an otherwise "overwhelmed" computer whose speed and
capaclty are as yet no match for a large combinatorial problem.

To make such a mode of usage a workable reallty, existing
computers must be modified to allow time-sharing among many
users.

Such system modification include the addltion of backup
random access memories, and an "exchange" for the dispatch of

 

devices and appropriate languages must be developed to bridge
