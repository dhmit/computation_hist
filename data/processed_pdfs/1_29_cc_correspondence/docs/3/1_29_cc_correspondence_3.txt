which bring you this side of the Atlantic: I was very shocked. Words are
always difficult to find on these occasions - we do extend our deepest

that pretty soon I will have to start thinking about when I am going
home and just what I am going to do after that, Time goes by at an

ways and I would be only too pleased to suggest places for you to visit -
