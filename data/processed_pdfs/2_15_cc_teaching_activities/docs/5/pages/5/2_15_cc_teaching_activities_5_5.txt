Electronic Computational Laboratory - 6.538

The subject matiter offered in 6.538 since 1947 provided the student
with two basic types of material. Specifically, some 80% of the laboratory
work was devoted to 2 study of electronic ecircuit conpanents by actual
laboratory work on the following experiments.

Time Measurement Equipment and Study of Synchroscopes and
Oscilloscopes

Pulse Generating Equipment

An experiment on blocking oscillators, delay-line pulse

generators, sharpening and squaring circuits, and ringing
circuits.

Bistable Circuits and Flip Flops

-An experiment covering various flip-flop circuits
including Thyratron, single-iube pentode eircuits, Eccles-
Jordan circuits, high-speed pentede circuits, and

transistorized flip flops.

Elecgronic Counters and Counting Circuits
An experiment covering Thyratron counters, binary

~ decade counters, screen-coupled counters, biquinary counters,

respectively.

Coincidence Circuilts and Gate Circuits

An experiment comsidering various typés of ecoilncidence
circuits: diodes, triodes, pentodes, and other'uultiple
coincidence devices.

Design of Bistable Circuits

A.project~type of experiment in which the student designs
(on papsr) a £1ip flop to meet certain operating conditions,
and tests his design by actual construction of the £lip flop,.
and testing its performance in the laboxratory.

Magnetic Recording of Pulsed Information

An expc*iment on magnetic recoxding in which the magnenic
material, head, recording frequency, pulse amplitude, tape
velocity, are varied and the resulting performance evaluated.

Tﬁmevpulse Distributor

An experiment studying vacuum tubes and diodes as control
elements by pulse distributior of volisge signals.

Square-Hysteresis~Loop Magnetic Storage Elements

An experiment on the use of magnetic cores as 2 storage
medla, number of turns on various windings, current amplitude
of recording and semsing tuims, are used as parsmeters.
