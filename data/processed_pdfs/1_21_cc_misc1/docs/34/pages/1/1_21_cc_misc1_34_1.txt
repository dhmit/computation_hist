Dear Phil:

Alan is absent on a much needed vacation. I am
therefore writing in response to your letter of January
24 to avoid undue delay in getting a reply to your
hands.

Dr. Eckhardt and I have discussed your letter in
some detail and I think we fully understand the point
of view you express. Moreover, we are sympathetic
towards it since we understand also the things you
are trying to accomplish.

We believe that it would be quite worthwhile both
for the Foundation and M.,I.T. if you could stop in on
your next visit here to explore more fully the problems
and difficulties we face. I should particularly want
Dr. Eckhardt to lead the discussion for the Foundation
because he deals with these problems every day. I shall
want to be present, and I know that Alan will wish to
participate also within the limitations set by his
schedule.

Sincerely yours,

——
