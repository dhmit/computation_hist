Dear Jack:

Our Whirlwind reeeeroh program for the
MIT Reeetor has struck pay dirt, and as usually
happens, we need to extend our calculations in
order to present a satisfactory hazards evalua-
tion to the Atomic Energy Commission. The trans-
ient studies we are doing can be extended easily,
but we need machine time in order to do this.

, Aooordinsly, I would like to request that
twenty hours of time on Whirlwind be assigned to
problem 266 for the coming tern.

Very truly yours,

T. Cantwell
