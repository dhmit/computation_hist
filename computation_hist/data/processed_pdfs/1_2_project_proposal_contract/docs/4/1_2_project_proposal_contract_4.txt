Subject: Proposal for Research and Training Project in Applied

Mathematics, Using Large—Scale Computing Equipment,

'Partimﬂarly Whirlwind ‘

Whirlwind Project has now reached a. stage of development
where its potentielitiee can be utilized, together with the other
computing equipment at'TechnoloQ, in a coordinated research and
training program, of the sort anticipated by ONE during its several
years of support of the Project. Both the Institute and the Navy are
vitally interested in the use of large—scale computing devices for the
solution of scientific and engineering problems, and for the promotion
of training for students lntereetod in this field.

Of course a part of the time of Whirlwind will be used for
the solution of a special Air Force problem, and it is expected that
the Air Force will. contrimte an appreciable part of the support of

‘ the Whirlxdnd Proj est, for the clevelopment of equipment and methods
for the solution of tMS problem. Nevertheless, appromatelq] half
the working time of the machine itself will be available for the funda-

mental program, mentioned above and outlined below.

Since a. research and training program must be closely linked with
other i'amlty activities, it is proposed that supervision of this part of
the program ho undertaken by the recently created Center for Machine Compuu
tation. The interdepartmental Aorisory Committee to this Center provides
a broad representation of the various scientific, engineering and training
activities likely to be involved. l

The program which IR might wish to support can be divided into
four sections::

1. Research in methods of numerical analysis and the form-
lotion of scientiﬁc problems for machine solution, together with suoport
of training of students in these methods.

2. alpport of the scientific and engineering applications
group previously referred to with Project Whirlwind so as to make the
W computer useful and available for the above research, and an old to
the research being carried on by MIT faculty and students.

3. A partial support of the maintenance of the In: computer.

4. Research on and investigation of digital computing machine
components.

It is understood that details of the program, which is neces—
sarily evomtionary in character, will be worked out from time to time with
the Scientific Officer of the ONE.

It is contemplated that $300,000 per annum for a period of at
least two years will be required to get this program rmder way. Detail
of the budget is as follows:

Item 1 $100,000
Item 2 100,000
Item 3 50,000
Item 4 50,000

The detailed mdgot for each of the items may run appI-mdmetely
