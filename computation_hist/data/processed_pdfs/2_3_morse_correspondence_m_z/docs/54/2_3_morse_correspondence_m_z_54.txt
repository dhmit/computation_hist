Dear Mr. Spencer:

There are several course related to digital computer given at
M.I.T. during the academic year. However, these course are available
only to those regularly enrolled either for degree programs Or as
special students. These course are described in the M.I.T. catalogue
which can be obtained from the registrar's office.

A short course is being given this summer on the special topic
of programming for the IBM 704. Because of the very large demand, this
course is currently open only to participants in the M.I.T. Computation

Center program.

Ye would prefer postponing a visit to our installation for the
present. The IBM 704 is not yet installed and the next month or so will
be largely devoted to getting the computer into operatiom. If you are
still interested in visiting the installation when the computer is
actually operating, we will be happy to consider a visit at that tire.

Sincerely Yours ’

Dean WN. Arden
