Dear Loren:

You will recall that in my letter of January 22, 1959,
to Mr. Melvin A. Shader, we requested fifty hours of 701. time
in addition to that normally allotable through the IL! .‘1‘. Compu-
tation Center for assistance in developing the field of Industrial
Dynamics. Although this time has not been used very heavily thus
far, we are now beginning to call on it and expect it to be
important to our work during the next two or three months.

The book on Industrial Dynamics referred to in my
letter last year is coming along well, but still requires a sub—
stantial number of computing machine runs. The work in economic
systems is, of course, a big and long-range undertaking and has
progressed rather slowly; but I have hopes that the tempo of
that research will pick up during the next year.

As I discussed with you on the phone this week, we
would much appreciate having available again next year an allo-
cation of fifty hours of 701. time for the Industrial Dynamics
work beyond that which is ordinarily available through the M.I.T.
Computation Center. Please let me know if you would like some
additional information to help you in acting on this request.

Sincerely ,

Jay w . Forrester-W//»
