Dear Walter:

I enclose coples of a letter which I have sent
%o Arthur Grad of NSF, which is self-explanatory. I en-
close enough coples for you to send to our "steering com-
mittee" if you feel this is desirable. I have also sent
copies to the following peoples

Dr. Saul Gorn, Unlversity of Pennsylvania
Dr, A, H. Taub, Unlversity of Illinois

Dr. J. W. Carre, University of North Carolina
Dr. 8. V. Parter, Indiana University

br. N. C, Metropolis, University of Chicago

If I get an answer to this before I leave I will
let you know about it.

Yours,

Philip M. Morse
Director
