The information contained on the attached summary sheets ~-
Table I and Table II -- was obtained from the 704 Accounting Machine usage
statistics reports which are prepared on a monthly basis (see Computation
Center Report CCE-2). The MONTHLY 704 Usage Report contains the following

date:
1. Problem Number (M = MIT, N = N.E, Univ.)
2. Date -- monthly period involved
3. Programmer Number
4, 704 Machine Time Usage by classification code
5. 704 Chargeable Machine Time (0.01 hour)
6. 704 Total Usage Muchine Time (0.01 hour)
7. Number of entries made into computer.

The classification code special operational tasks contain the
following items:

1. MOO2 Demonstration of the 704 as part of tours, visits, etc.

2. MO10 Idle Time -- time which the 704 is idle.

3. MOl IBM Cambridge use of MIT time.

4, MO21 SAP -- Share Assembly Program, 704 symbolic language

| routines.

5. MO22 FORTRAN -~ 704 Formula Translation, an algebraic
language.

6, MO25 Share subroutines -- various utility programs for
general 704 use.

7. MO3l Magnetic tape testing time.

In conclusion, it must be emphacized that the composition of certain
categories in Table I are subject to error because the role of the sponsoring
project appears to cross our classification lines. Many applicants classify
their problems as faculty or educational research and avoid mention of DSR
affiliation despite the fact that the programmers are all on DSR payroll.

By calling a number of the individual project leaders, I have attempied %o
clarify the classifications. This appears to be the best I can do at the
present time.
