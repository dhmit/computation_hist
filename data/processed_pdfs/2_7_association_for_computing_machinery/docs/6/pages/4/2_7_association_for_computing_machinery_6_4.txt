In particular, the problem of starting the recurrence relations is
discussed from the viewpoint that a eomputer'pwec!tlâ€˜unlt be able
to achieve a prescribed accuracy entirely from pree-established
eriteria,

It 1s assumed that the required spherical Bessel functions
to be generated for a given positive value of x and the integral
values of n=0(1)N are one of the four types: 3 (x), n,(x), 1,.(x) or
k. (x). |

Straightforward conalderations show that the upward use of
the three-term reeursion relations is numerically accurate for nn(x)
and k. (x), Inasmuch as these funcetions for order 0 and -1 ave
essentially elementary trigonometric and exponential funetions,
starting the upward process offers no problem, Conversely for x
not large compared to N downward recursion is the only direction
numerically accurate for the funetions J,(x) and 1 (x). However,
instead of computing the funetion values for order N and Nel to start
the downward reoursion, a speelal technique 1s used where the
recursion process is started at a higher order, ), with the approxi-
mation J;) or 19 equal to zero and J,) -1 or 1; 1 equal to unity,
Here the barred quantities are the unnormalized functions, The value
of ) is chosen high enough so that the ratios of successive values

of J or 1n are accurate for all n less than or equal to N,
