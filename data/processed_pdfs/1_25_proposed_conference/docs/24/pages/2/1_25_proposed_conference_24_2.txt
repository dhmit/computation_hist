Dr. Grad «Qw July 13, 1959

myself as chalrman, Professor Walter Freiberger of the Depart-
ment of Mathematies at Brown University as secretary, and cther
members as noted in the enclosed announcement. It was agreed
that some time in the next year or two it would be most helpful,
particularly for the snaller newey centers, to have a confere
ence off two or three days on problems of particular interest to
college computing centers. The discussions could fecus arecund
four general arcas:s

; an . istrat : What are good and bagd ways of
filnancing centers? What fraction of time can be "ssld” and
o -"7! = - ‘ u‘:,ﬁ. st \] “ "_.!," ?:J

2. Computer-oriented re8earch: What are the arcas, of real
intellectual challenge, for researsh in the use of machines?
What are the opportunities for theses in thesc fields, how are
Such theses to be supervised and how are degrees to be granted
on the basis of these theses:

S Curriculum and instruction: What sort of courses should be
offered? Should courses on machine ecoding be given fop eredit
I as short courses without credit or as parts of ocher appro-
priate courses? UWhat advanced courges with real intellectual
ontent, intimately involving computing machines, are belng
iven and in what departmentg?

how collere omputing centers fit into thelr academic structure
and how thev ean help mor: completely to educate scientists and
engineers is something which has been a subject of discussion in
various parts of NSP to my knowledge., My question to you, there-
fore, is an exploratory onc: Is NSF interested in guch a confere
ence? Ig it intercsted enough %o finance it in part or in whole?
