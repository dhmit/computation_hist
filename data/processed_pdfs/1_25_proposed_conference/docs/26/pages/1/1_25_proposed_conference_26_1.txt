Dear Dr. Morse:

The committee of university computer center
directors, of which you are chairman, met as planned
during the recent ACM Conference at MIT. The re-
search and curriculum subcommittee, in addition, held
several Joint meetings. Itwas decided at the sub-
committee meetings that a questionnaire, as such,
would not be circulated by these committees. It was
declided instead to circulate a letter which, in effect,
would be an invitation for papers to be submitted
covering various aspects, which will be enumerated,
pertinent to research and curriculum in computer
sciences. We will circulate this letter to some 800
persons on a mailing list of interested people com-
piled by Dr. Rymer of Northwestern University. We
hope to get this letter out some time next week.

We realize that the results of such a letter will
be considerably less in volume than a bona fide question-
naire would be, but we feel that a much better as-
sessment of ideas on the given subjects will be
possible with such replies and provide material for
program planning. The committee will attempt to
evaluate and compile the ideas contalned in the essays
we do receive. I will have copies of this summary
sent to the rest of the committee. We will set a
deadline on replies by October 15 or so, so that you
can receive our summary early in November. I hope
this arrangement will be satisfactory to you. If
you have any comments, don't hesitate to forward them
to me.
