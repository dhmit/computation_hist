1. It is a fourth~ysar elective subject degigned for the
undergraduate,

2. It is a survey subject which covers aumerical analysis,
analog computation, and digital computation,

3. It provides the student with a ganeral knowledge of some
of the numerical metheds necessary for machine computation.

Admittedly, such a survey subject cannot be ail inclusive, and because of

the large enrollment, it is no lomger posgible io provide the student with
actual physical contact with any computer.

Since 1853 this subject has turned out to be increasingly popular.
As g matter of fact, it is now offered both fÂ£a2ll and spring terms, Tho
attendance is quite high. There were 106 studeats in 6,25 during the
Foll Term 1958, and 47 sitwdents during the Spring Term 1956. This subject
offered at the undergraduaie level emnables students to decide whether they
are intevested in taking additiopal subjects in this area, and if they are,
there are 10 graduate subjects in which they may enroll.

Introduction to Digital Computer gg__d_i_gg and Logic - 6.533

This subject was, as usual, again offered during the Spring Term 1856,
and there were 97 students envolled. As o result, it was necessary to divide
the subject into two sectiens taught by D. Arden and P. Helwig, respectively.

Because of the large enrollment in this subject, no attempt was made
tc make actual use of any computer. As a matter of fact; the usual detailed
coding for the Whirlwind Computer was not presented, and students were not
allowved to use the computer because of the large size of the group. Since the
departure of Professor Adams, the content of the course has been changed
somewhat, and during the spring term considerable emphasis haos been devoted
to a study of the logical design of the internal system aspects of several
large computers ~- Whirlwind, NORC, IDl, etec,
