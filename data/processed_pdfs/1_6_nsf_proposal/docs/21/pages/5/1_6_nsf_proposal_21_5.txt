Facllities: The MIT Computation Center will have a Type 704
Electronic Data Processing Machine with the following machilne
complement: 12 magnetic tape units, 2 magnetic CORE storage unlts
containing a total of 8,000 words, 1 magnetic drum unit contalning
4,000 worde of storage, the usual on-line punched card reader,
alphabetic printer, and punched card recorder as well as the 3
off-line magnetic tape controlled printer, magnetic tape controlled
card punch, and punched card-to-magnetic tape converter, respectively.
In addition to the 704, there will be 10 auxiliary punched card
machines inecluding card punches, collators, sorters, reproducers,
interpreters, and the Type 407 Accounting Machine. The aggregate
?%ﬁhine rental, in excess of Z50,000 per month, will be donated by

 

 

" The Type 70% EDPM unit is one of the fastest large-scale
commercial computers available today. Since the MIT installation
will be but one of many in the field, techniques, programs, and
numerical procedures developed for this machine will be of use to
others having access to 704 equipment.

Personnel: Supervisory and Administrative Personnel Associated with
he Project _

Principal Investigator to be Professor Phllip M. Morse,
Director of the Computation Center. He has been in contact with
computing problems during his career in theoretical physics since
1930, and with the use of cowputing equipment since the first Bush
differential analyzer was available at MIT in 1936. He got his
Ph.D. in physics at Princeton in 1929 and has been at MIT since
1931, with occasional leaves of absence. His publications include
the books "Quantum Mechanics" (with E. U. Condon) 1930, "Vibration
and Sound" 1936, "Methods of Operations Research" (with G. E. Kimball) |
1950, and "Methods of Theoretical Physics" (with Herman Feshbach) |
1953, and about a2 hundred Jjournal articles, many of which glve re- |
sults obtained from machine computation. For further bilographilc |
details, see "Who's Who." Only a fraction of hils salary wlll be
charged to the Project.

 

Professor F. B. Hildebrand has been teaching and conducting
research in numerical analysis in the Mathematics Department at MIT
since 1938. He got his Ph.D. in Mathematics from MIT in 1G40. He
18 the author of three texts: "Advanced Calculus for Engineers”
(1949), "Methcds of Applied Mathematics" (1952) and "Introduction
to Numerical Analysis" (1956) as well as a number of articles 1n
various research journals. Only a fraction of his salary will be
charged to the Project.

Dean N. Arden, who has been a member of the Whirlwind
Programming Research Group for three years, has been head of the
group since July 1955 and who will head €he programming research
