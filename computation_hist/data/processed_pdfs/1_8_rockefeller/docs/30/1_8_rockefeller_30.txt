‘ THE SUPPORT OF MACHINE PROGRAMMING STAFF
FOR THE UTILIZATION OF '
ELECTRONIC COMPUTERS IN SOCIAL SCIENCE

ThercilitansLus-I’Qtentmmm

The high—speed computing facility, to be installed by
IBM at the new Computation Center at MIT will be the largest and
most flexible facility in this country to be devoted exclusively
to unclassified research and education. IBM will contribute more
than a .fifth of a million a year in its support for maintenance
and operation. What is‘needed, in addition, to make this an out-
standing center for the investigation of digital computer
potentialities in all branches or scientific research, is about
$100, 000 a year for the support of a research staff, which can
work with scientists in various fields to develop new and more
effective techniques of machine utilization.

Arrangements have been made for all the colleges in New
England to participate in the use of the machines, and IBM has set
up funds for Assistantships to enable graduate students, at MIT
and at the participating colleges, to spend time at the Center
learning to use the equipment. This Center and these arrangements
represent potentialities for new developments in social and
physical science of great and unexplored importance.

There will be no charge for machine time made to students
or faculty of the participating institutions. Maintenance and the
routine aspects of operation will be taken care of by IBM, so that
those who know how to use such equipment can use it, without cost,
up to the fourteen hours a day during which the machine will be
available at first. A number of problems in economies are going
to be put on the mac.hine by Professor Solow of MIT and by Professor
Orcutt of Harvard and, as other research workers in the social
sciences learn how to use the equipment, other problems will be
brought to the Center.

In the long run, the various social scientists in New
England will probably learn enough about machine operation to be
able to make the machine useful to them. But it takes time to
learn to program a machine of this size, and research workers in
any field are reluctant to take much time off to learn new tech-
niques. In addition, to get the most out of a computer one should
have more than a casual knowledge of the electronic details of its
operation. This combination of knowledge, of a social science and
of a computer, will probably be developed in our next generation
of research workers. But if we want to get started using computers
in social science 22!, we will have to use a team: a man who knows
the field plus a man who knows the machine.

Need for a Research Staff in Machine Utilization. an
Ingredient in the Team ‘

This last ingredient is the part which is left out of
the contribution which IBM has made to the Computation Center. To
put the Center at the forefront of research, we must have a full-
time staff of enthusiastic machine specialists, to teach prospective
users how to make the machine do its tricks and to Join with
research workers who come with a "gleam in their eye", forming
teams which can utilize to the fullest the computer's capabilities
in research. This staff will be hard, but not impossible, to
recruit. We have the beginnings of one formed now, at present
slanted chiefly'toward research in the physical sciences, and we
have obtained an NSF grant of $35,000 a year for three years to
support it. We have the graduate student bodies of the partici-
pating institutions to pick from and we have already begun to make
contact with those students who are interested in machine utiliza-
tion“ There are about two dozen IBM research assistants appointed
for this year; We should be able to pick from the best of these a
few who would like to stay on for two or three years more, after.
they have obtained their advanced degrees in engineering, mathe-

matics or science, to be a part of our research staff, potential
members of research teams‘

be financed indirectly by contributions from each project which
uses it, if this were considered to be the most desirable way of
keeping it going. At present, however, support by contributions
from established research projects can support only about a third
of the $100,000 needed, which would leave unsupported the most
fruitful research of all, the unknown results which are sure to
come when a machine expert of the Center staff works together with
the economist, psychologist or sociologist' on the faculty of one

of our participating colleges who comes to the Center with only a
"gleam in his eye" .

Possible Initial Directions for Investigation

As indicated, we cannot write down in any detail the
directions which this research effort will take, as -the various
teams are formed and begin to interact There are several general
areas which we feel should be investigated, which are certain to
produce results of immediate interest and which, in addition,
should provide hints as to still more important applications.

A. One of these is the deeper investigation of machine
logic itself. A computer of the complexity of the 704 is too big
to be able to see immediately how it can "think". Most machines
are now programmed to do ordinary arithmetic, a few programs have
been devised to make the machine obey the rules of Boolean logic
and some thought has been spent on working out programs to make
the machine play chess or checkers, in other words to obey the
logic of a game. Different sciences and branches of learning
have their own kinds of thought processes. For example, economics
and genetics each have patterns of thought which do not exactly
duplicate those of physics, Fundamental research is needed to
work out programs, rules of thought for the machine, which corres-
pond more closely to these other patterns. With a machine of the
flexibility and storage capacity of the 70#, such research is
worth whilev It will have to be tackled, at the beginning, by
teams of experts in the fi 1e of interest, together with mathe-
matical logicians who know machine operation.

direction or investigation is in the application of machine tech-
niques to library inventorying, cataloging and record-keeping.
Although special-purpose machines will probably be required in the
end, many ideas and procedures can be developed and checked out on
the general-purpose machine at the Center with the addition, per-
haps, of some specially built input and output equipment. The
staff of the MIT Library is interested in this work and will con-
tribute its knowledge to its progress.

0. Perhaps the most promising line or advance, in part
because the least investigated up till now, is in the field of
social science experiments, where the computer can be used as
recorder, scorer and referee. Tactical situations in warfare are‘
already being studied by "gaming techniques" at Band and in other
military operations research groups. Similar problems in various
fields of the social sciences can also be studied by simplifying
the situation down to some sort of "game", with more or less com-
plicated rules, which can be played by groups of investigators, to
see what the consequences are of various strategies. If the llgames"
are to correspond, even distantly, to some actual social situation,
the rules must be quite complicated and the scoring will require a
great deal of statistical computation. It has been found that only
by the use of computing machines can the scoring be speeded up
sufficiently so that enough games can be run through to provide
an overoall grasp of the situation under study. Such "gaming
techniques" are closely related to the experiments of Bavelas on
the behavior of task-oriented groups. The use of a properly pro-
grammed computer would provide such experiments with a powerful
and flexible means of changing, controlling, and analyzing these
experiments in social psychologyw In this field we could work in
close collaboration with the Center for International Studies at
MIT and with the psychology departments in several other colleges.

Equipment, Personnel and Budget

The suggested budget for three years is tentative and is
more dependent on our ability to hire one or two more experts in
computer programming than on the amount of work to be done. If we
can find more men of the right sort, more work can be done. During
the calendar year 1957 we may not be able to find more than one
senior man, one or two post—doctoral fellows and a couple of tech-
nical assistants. By the fall of 1957 we may be able to persuade
one or twa faculty members of the cooperating institutions to spend
appreciable fractions of their time at the Center, working on some
of the problems mentioned earlier. A suitable fraction of their
salaries should be carried by the research funds of the Center
and, if the work is in the social sciences, would be chargeable
to the proposed grant. Some of the experiments in "gaming" will
require special input or output equipment. Therefore it may turn
out that less than $35,000 will be spent the first year, more than
$35,000 the second. The important point, however, is that because
of the presence of the equipment of the Center, supported by IBM,
the majority of the budget of this grant can be spent on salaries
for people directly carrying out the research outlined in this
proposal. -

The staff can begin to be assembled this spring, but
expenditures would probably not reach full rate until the summer
of 1957. Consequently, the grant could officially start March or
April 1957, or could start as late as June, if some earlier
expenditures could be charged against the grant at that time.
