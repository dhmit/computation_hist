Dear Al; 4

Professor Morse asked me to write to you concerning a
Dr, A, P. Ershov and his visit to MIT. On March 25, Prof, Morse
wrote you inviting Ershov to MIT during the two-week period of

August 30 through September 12 and indicated we would pay his
~ travel from Durham, North Carolina, to MIT, living expenses for

the two-week stay at Cambridge plus an additional $100 for the

two seminar lectures which we would like him to present at that time,

In your recent note you asked for an additional itinerary,
As you are well aware, the ACM conference will consume the first
week of his stay, 1 suggested that Dr, Ershov be asked to present
a paper at the ACM conference, I understand Prof, Carr has issued
this invitation,

We would like to make profitable use of Ershov's time
during the second week by having him present two seminars followed
by a mutual discussion and interghange of information of our
respective activities, I shall prepare a detailed itinerary
concerning times, people and subject matter at a later date, At the
moment, I feel it is sufficient that Ershov know that he has been
invited to MIT for the above-mentioned two-week period,

If you heed any additional information immediately, please
contact me,

Sincerely yours,

F. M, Verzuh
