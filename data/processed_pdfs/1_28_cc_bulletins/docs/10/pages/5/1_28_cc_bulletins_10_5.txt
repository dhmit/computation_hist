that they are low-density on your request cards,
Similarly, if you are producing tapes for other
1nstallations, low-density is more universal
than high-density., Normally, the user should
not use the Set Density*ingtruction.

2. Speed - We expect to get a factor of about
three increase in Speed over the 709, Remember
this in your time estimates,

5. Scope -.The cathode ray oscilloscope will no
longer use copy-logic. Routines presently
working on the 709 must be converted, The
Centerts staff will, of course, convert those
subprograms that are on the library tape.

The 1401's - Things to Start Thinking About
——————oF >0 otart lhinking About

The 1401's are in some ways not compatible with
present equipment, You should take careful note of
the following:

l. Program Controlled Listings - ALL printed
output will be listed under program control,
(Printed form controlled by the first
character of the record.) This Will be
controlled by the 1401 program, not by a
Simple switch setting., Most of our users -
all FMS users - are already committed to
this procedure, but if you have a program
not now using program control, you should
convert.

 

a. JSpace Suppression - This is a Speclal
feature we hope to have on our 14011ts,
Even 1f we do have Space suppression, -
you must be aware of this difference -
the 1401 printers space after printing
the line, not before, as our present
printers do. Thus the Space suppress
symbol "+" should be in the recorg
after which you do not want Spacing to
occur. For example, FPRMAT (2H+A/3H B)
would print AB.
