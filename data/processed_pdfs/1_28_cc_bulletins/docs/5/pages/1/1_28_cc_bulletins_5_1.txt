SUGGESTION

The Center suggests that you file these BULLETINS as
informal supplements to your Procedures Handbook.

PROGRAMMING COURSE

There will be a one week programming course given by
the Computation Center during the period September 4 through
September 8, Classes will meet from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.
each day at the Computation Center with morning lectures
and afternoon laboratory use of the computer.

The course presentation will not assume any previous
computer experience. Emphasis will be primarily on
programming with the FORTRAN compiler language, but the use
of the FAP Assembler Language and the MAD compiler will also
be included. The 7090 Monitor System which allows flexible
and automatic operation of the computer will be described,
In addition, the procedures and conventions of the Center
will be reviewed. Participants will have the opportunity
to run programs they have written during the course.

Additional information and application forms may be
obtained from MIT Department Headquarters, New England
Institutional Representatives or from Miss Sandra Parrella
at the Computation Center, Room 26-142.
