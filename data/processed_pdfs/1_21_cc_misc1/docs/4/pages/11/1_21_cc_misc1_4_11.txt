The project here outlined is a pioneering effort, and cannot
hope to elicit financial support until at least a representative part
of the work is done. To this end, the Trustees of the Hartford
Seminary Foundation have graciously lent a small sum, to be repaid
as soon as outside aid is forthcoming, to begin work. The under-

signed have drafted the present document after considerable pre-
liminary studies,

The punching of Book I of the Institutes is currently underway,
A graduate student in linguistics andâ€”mat Hartford Seminary,
Miss Dora Koundakjian, has been trained in key=-punching technique
. by the data-processing staff of the Travelers Insurance Co. to do
this first phase of the task., When this first portion is completed,
the undersigned will carry out studies looking to the processing of
the entire book. Plan for future concordance work will be determined
by the outcome of the present venture.

At the present moment, the undersigned co-workers need the
following kinds of help: (1) sponsorship and consultation at a high
ecclesiastical and academic level, (2) financial support for costs
of key-punching, equipment rental, technical assistance, and sup-
plies, (3) willingness to donate, or at least to provide at nominal
cost, computer time, (4) assistance in publishing the concordance.
No one grganization or individual can offer all four sorts of help,
but all interested can assist in one way or another,
