Dear Dean Campbell:

Thank you for your letter of November 17
asking me to give a talk on the use of the Computation
Center. I will be glad to do so and will tailor my
discussion to the group you have #n mind.

The talk that I would like to give would be
one which outlines the background of the Center. In
addition, I would like to demonstrate by short examples
the relative ease with which it 1s now possible to use
the Computation Center.

Please feel free to call me to arrange a more
definite time and place. |

Sincerely,

/
