Electronic Cmutational Laboratory - 6.538

The subject matter offered in 6.538 since 1947 provided the student
with two basic types or notorial. Specifically, sons 80% of the laboratory
work was devoted to a. study of electronic circuit components by actual
laboratory work on the following experiments:

I.

II.

III.

IV .

VI.

VII.

V111 .

IX.

Tine ﬂessureaent Equimnt and study of Bynchroscopee and
Oscilloscopes

Pulse Generating Equipment

An experimt on blocking oscillators, delay-line pulse

generators, sharpening and sduaringvoircuits, and ringing
circuits.

Bistablo Circuits and Flip Flops

vAn expori-ent covering various flip-ﬂop circuits
including Thyratron, single-tube pentode circuits, Eccles-
Jordnn circuits, high-speed pentodo circuits, and

tmsistorized flip flops .

Electronic Counters and Counting Circuits

An- experiment covering Thyratron counters, binary
decade counters, screen-coupled counters, biquinary counters,
respectively.

Coincidence Circuits and Gate Circuits

An experiment considering various types of coincidence
circuits: diodes, triodes, pentodes, and other multiple
coincidence devices. -

Design or Bistuble Circuits

A projectetype or: experiment in which the student designs
(on paper) ‘a' flip flop to meet certain operating conditions,
and tests his design by actual construction of the flip flop,
and testing its performance in the laboratory.

Magnetic Recording of Pulsed Information

An superman on magnetic recording in which the seguetic
material, head, recording frequency, pulse amplitude, tape
velocity, are varied and the resulting'perfomce evaluated.

Time Pulse Distributor

An experiment studyiw vacuum tubes and diodes as control
elements by pulse distribution of voltage sigmls.

Square-Hysteresis-Loop “emetic Storage Elements

An experiment on the use of emetic cores as a storage
media, nulher of tune on various windings, current amplitude
of recording and sensing turns, are used as parameters.
