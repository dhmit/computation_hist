vDear lrnnk.

Thunks ter your nonorandnn ot !bhrulry ti!th, ragarding

rirst-' The only difference that I note between the out-

lines for the Senior Elective and for the Graduate Subject

6,538, is that 6,538 looks to be somewhat more of the same.
Both statenonts resenbla the one 1n the current cataloguo for

Buhjoct 6,538,

st M e dclsire of our‘ Ad Hoc Committes .
offer as ap undergraduate elective substantially what you
now offer as Subject 6.538, I believe we should do this.

Atter a subject hns been oporated at the graduate levol
in an emerging field for a number of years, it is inevitable
that the undergraduate demand for it becomes substantial,
Either it should be replaced by something vastly more intel-

lectual at the frontiers of the field, or it should be otterod'

as a Senior Elective. The present videspraad undorgraduate

‘student demand for information of the kind that you S0 conpe- S

tently give is proof of this situation.

I am not happy with the substance of your proposed gradu-
ate subject. Furthermore, I doubt the wisdom of your making
a commitment to teach an undergraduate and a graduate subject
at this time when the demand is so great that what you now of-
fer is in demand for both terms.

I propose, therefore, to use one or the other of the ver-
sions that you have given me at this time only as a Senior
Elective, 6.258. You may tell me which version you prefer and
what to call it.

Sincerely yours,
