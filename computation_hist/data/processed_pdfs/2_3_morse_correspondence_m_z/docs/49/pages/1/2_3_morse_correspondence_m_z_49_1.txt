Dear Di. Glaser:s

digital computers in the soclal

aciences. 1 recent ly wrote to Pen, say
the process of installing a 704 for unclassified research

and education, and that we ought to investigate some
applications in social scilence. 1t seems that we should
get together soon and exchange views.

My out~of=town schedule is frozen through March,

but I have some time here. Would it be pogsgible for you
to come up here for a day. either Tuesday or Thursday,
some time in March? You may find some developments of
interest here, and I'm sure we'll get some interesting

ideas from you.
