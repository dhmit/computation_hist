Morse reported that Euwena had declined the RA
offer and that Osmin had been awarded an NSF fellowship;
Tubis, Sartori and Uretslq had accepted; Glendennins had
refused and Hinkel had not been heard tron. The Physics
Department has no other recommendations now.

Lin reported that K. Ralston has accepted, Reich is
going elsewhere and that Mcnroy is now recommended as an addi-
tional RA. The Comittee approved. Lin also brought up the
application or Dr. Bayard Rankin tron the University 0: Cali-
fornia as a possible post-doctoral fellow. The Committee de-
cided that if there is someone of the Mathematics faculty who
is interested enough in Rankin's main line or activity to wish
to supervise his work, an appointment would be appropriate.

Caldwell recomended that Boy be continued in his
appointment next year. This was approved; D. A. Huffman to be
his supervisor. Morse reported that Professor Hurley had
recommended the continuation or Vozort, which was also approved.
Hrones said the mechanical Engineering Department may have a
recommendation next time. Adams indicated there may he recommen-
dations from the Sloan School for a man to work on some appli—
cations of machines to industrial practice.

Adams also indicated that there were possible 55
thesis problems for Math students who were interested. He and
Verzuh, Lin and Hildebrand will discuss this and report back
next time.
