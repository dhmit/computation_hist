Dear Professor Morse:

In accordance with our discussions at our recent meeting
on Friday, July 1, I have prepared a one-page summary containing
gome of the information which you requested. I hope this summary
gives you the infermation you will need for your meeting with
Dr. Stratton on Thursday, July 7.

There is a large amount of supporting figures which were
used to prepare this summary, and I shall be happy to pass these
on to you if need arises.

1 have examined the costs associated with the possible
replacement of our special machines (604 and CPC) by a Type 6850
Calculator, and I am eagerly awaiting the results of your meeting
with Dr. Hurd. As you know, we must place our order immediately if we
are to get the 650 machine here for the Fall Term 1855.

1 would like to see you to discuss the above and other
personal matters sometime at your convenience.

Sincerely yours,

F. M. Verszuh
