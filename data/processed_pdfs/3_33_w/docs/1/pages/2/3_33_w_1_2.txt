We recognize that in asking you for 100 hours of time on the IB.M. T0h

Y i s, s A

computer at M.I.T, we are making a very substantial request, We hope that in
considering this request and ways in which it can be met that you will take
into account the enormous amount of work which we have put into this project,
At the very least this is a real indication of how much we believe in its long
run significance to the social sciences, We also hope that you will take into
account the many close and I think mutually beneficial connections that Martin
Greenberger, John Korbel, and I have had with the Computation Center at M.I.Te
and its development as the leading research center of its type, We also hope
that you will take account of the significant amount of attention and recognition
that is being given to the importance of work of the type that we have beemn
ploneeringe My appointment at the University of Wisconsin and the present
development of a large-scale Social Systems Research Institute here is just ome
concrete piece of evidence on this pointe

For purposes of testing the adequacy of our demographic model, aligning
it with aggregative time series data, carrying out sensitivity experiments,
and making limited projection runs we need about eight seven or eight year
runs and about two tem year rums, Since our ratio of machine time to real time
is just under 1,2 hours per year of real time this means that we need about
100 hours of machins time.

Enclosed you will find an internal memorandum of mine which discusses
the problem of studying and aligning models such as ours by simulation
techniques, It is entitled "Alignment of Model With Observed Aggregative
Time Series." The runs needed to carry out the described procedure will also
provide us with a critical set of sensitivity experimentse

Our hope is that the requested machine time can be made available to us !
in June end in July, Martin Greenberger would be incharge of our actual use
of the machine, but Korbel and I also would be in Cambridge and devote our full
efforts to successfully carrying to completion this work and in assisting Martin
in any feasible waye.

We will be glad to have access to the machine at any time of the day or night
or on week-ends, We also would be glad to cover up to a2 thousand or so dollars
any extra costs that might be involved in operating the 704 on an extra shift
for a period of timee

Martin Greemberger and Johm Korbel will be available to help work out a
mtually satisfactory way of meeting our request, if you wish to call upon themg
and if there is anything else that I can do to facilitate this matter, I am
anxious to do 80,

With best regardse

Sincerely yoursy
