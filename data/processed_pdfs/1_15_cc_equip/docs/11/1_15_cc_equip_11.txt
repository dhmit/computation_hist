Dear Mr. Travato:

in accordance with our discussions at our conference on Thursday
and Friday, January 31 = February 1, respectively, 1 am enclosing the
material which we prepared during this meeting. Specifically, I am
enclosing the following material:

 

1. Winne's sketeh of the duct connection dimensions for the
Type 733 Magnetic Drum Unit,

| 2. Winne's sketeh of the floor panel cutouts for the Type 736
|

 

3. Winne's sketch of the floor panel cutouts for the Type 737
Magnetic Core Unit,

| 4. Winne's sketch of the floor panel cutouts of the duct connections
for the 704 Main Frame.

& You will note that all of the above floor sketches include 1/2" clearance on
all edges.

 

|

| MIT has made field measurements of the actual locations of the

steel floor "cutouts" which we -- IBM sales individuals, IBM special engineers,
and MIT have agreed to in the 704 Calculator Room (Room 26«156). 1 have

prepared a 3/4" drawing which indicates the field-measured dimensions and

| locations of the holes which have been cut in the steel floor of the 704 room.

2 I am enclosing a 3/4" field layout of the floor plan of the 704 room dated

| February 2, 1957. This drawing will give you a written record of the many
changes we had to make during your recent visit.

Mr. Geroge Travato P= February 7, 1857

iam very pleased to hear that the cable lengths which we ordered
exceed the dimensions we measured in the field, since we were concerned
about the length of cable between the 759 and 727RD units.

In closing, I again want to thank you and your group for your
wholehearted cooperation in working very bng hours under trying conditions
during this two-day period,

Sincerely yours,

F. M. Verzuh
