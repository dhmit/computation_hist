Bince you are over-drawn by 5,200 minutes, I have been authorized

wind I computer for work under problem 245, Theory of Neutron Reactions

You might be interested to know that since your problem began,
you have used 9,603 .4 minutes (as of Seplember 23) of machine time. If you
had been charged at the regular rate of $250/hour, the total amount charged
to your acgount would have been $40,392 40.

IZ you find that you need more time, it will be necessary to
submit & new request.

Sincerely,
