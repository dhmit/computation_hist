Dear Arthur:

I enclose a copy of the latest Progress Report of
the MIT Computation Center. Some of the marked items in
the Preface and on pages 1, 6, 7 and 116 will, I believe
be of interest to you.

We would appreciate your comments or suggestions
concerning this Report, or concerning our work, which is
in part supported by the National Science Foundation. Ve
are sending you six additional copies of the Report under

separate cover. If you desire more copies, please let me
know. |

Sincere ly’

Philip M. Morse
