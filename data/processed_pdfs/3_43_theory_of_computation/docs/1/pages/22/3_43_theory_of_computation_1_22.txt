e The rule of replacement can be extended in
the case of ‘conditional expressions. Suppose o~
is an occurrence of a sub-expression of an ex-
pression . We define a certain propositional
expression T called the premise of &~in B as
follows:

1) The premnisc Of~ind~is T.

S. Recursion Induction :
Suppose a function £ 1is defined recursively

whcreéf is an expression that in general contains
£f. Suppose that ¢ is the sct of n-tuplets

(min)' = (=0 —>m,T->m'+n")"

min_ - =-(m=0—m',T~ (m*)+n~)
It is casily seen that the functions g and h
defined by the cquations g(m,n) = (m+H)' and
h(m,n) = m'+n both satisfy the equation f. For
example, it is clear that g(m',n™) = (m'+a™)" and
h(m',n”) = (m')'+n~. Therefore, by the principle

of recuwrsion induction h and g are equivalent
functions on the domain of where f is dofined,
but this is the set of all pairs of integers.

The fact that f(m,n) converges for all m and
n is a case of the fact that all functions defined
by equations of the form

Th 3. ((min)+p = (m+p)+n
Proof., LJt f(m,n,p) = (p=0 — m4n,T— £(n',n,p”))
Again f converges for all m,n,p. We have
(mm)+p = (p=0 — m+n,T — (m+n) ' +p~)
“(P=0 —> m+n, T — (m'+n)+p~) using Th 2.
(m+p)+n = (P=0 — m, T — m'+p~) N
= (p=0 — m+n, T — (m'+p~)+n)
Each of these forms satisfics the equation for 3
f(n,n,p).
Setting m=0 in Th 3 gives |-
(On)+4+p = (0+p)+n
so that if we had O+m = m we would have - .
commutativity of addition,
In fact, we cannot prove O+m = m withou£4
making some assumptions that take into account
