Dear Mr. Hull:

Thank you very much for your letter of June 12th
indicating your interest in the facilities at the M.1,T.
Computation Center. Inasmuch as you are currently located
in New England, it seems to me that you should direct your
inquiry to Professor Morse, Director of the M.I.T. Compu-
tation Center. I am, therefore, forwarding your letter to
Professor Morse 80 that he may have some background when
you get in touch with him,

 

Very truly yours,

 

Melvin A, Shader
