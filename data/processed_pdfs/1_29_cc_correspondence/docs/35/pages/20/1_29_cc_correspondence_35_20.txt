The trickiest situation arises 1n converting those 70l

programs that utilized the time between CPY instructions.

There are on the 709 maximum allowable Cimes between tréns—

mission commands exactly as there are on the 704,

In the following example, it would be expected that the

704 program would delay on the CPY instruction and the 709

program would delay on the Load Channel instruction. (See

709-7090 Reference Manual, p. 24)
