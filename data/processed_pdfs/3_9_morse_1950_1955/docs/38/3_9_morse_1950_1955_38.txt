Deer Professor ¥Y¥orse:

In accordance with your recent request, I am enclosing
six copies of a report entitled, "Summary of the Activities of the
Center of Armalysis." This report describes the activities of the
Center of Analysis staff which were performed for the Air Materiel
Cormand during the first 9 months of 1960. It does not include
eny of the computational services of the Differential Analyzer per-
formed for the M.I.T. family or for non-MIT groups.

This report is necessarily brief because of its summarizing
nature; however, it does indicate the fields of endeavor, sand its
bibliogrephy may serve as an additional source of information should
the need arise.

Very truly yours,

Foe M. Verzuh
