Sub ject: High-Speed Computing Equipment for the Institute,
a Proposal

Requirements - The Institute needs & service computing center,
equipped with modern high-speed computing machines administered
by a service staff, in order to carry forward its educational pro-
gram in three general filelds:

(a) General Educational Research - Many engineering
and scientific research problems carried on by students and staff
require the help of high-speed computing equipment to carry out
the related calculations. Many industries, hiring our graduates,
prefer to hire men who have had some experience in using such
equipment. ;

(b) Development of Control Equipment - The Institute
is a leader in the development of special control equipment (as,
for example, the automatic milling machine) which often involves
the design of special-purpose computers. In many cases, the ini-
tial part of the development 1s facilitated by being able to try
out ideas on a general-purpose computer.

(¢) Busiress Data Handling and Operations Research -
A very promising field of machine application i8 in business adminis-
tration. The end products will often be special-purpose machines
(for handling bank deposits or insurance premiums, or the like),

but much of the development can use a general-purpose computer to

try out ideas. In addition, many production-scheduling and other
operations research problems of business and industry need a high-
speed computer for their solution.

Already the requirements for machine time for thesis
work and for general faculty research in these categories occupy
about half the time of a high-speed machine. In addition, four
courses (6.25, 6.535, 6.538, 16.91) involve training in machine
coding and require a falr amaount of machine time for the students;
another dozen or more related courses could use some machine time
if it were available. (See Appendix A.) Over and beyond these,
primarily educational, needs are the computing requirements of the
various DIC and DDL proJjJects, which could use up all the time of
a machine by themselves. However, such projects can well afford
