Dear Harvey:

Thanks for your letter. I think we'd be
interested in your compiler for 650, if you are going
to write it up. We are getting along with ours for
the 704, If you come east, we'd be glad to talk 1%
over.

Don't forget to let us know about bright
youngsters . If they are interested 1in going on for
an advanced degree, with specialization in computer
use, we have assistantships.

Yours,

Philip M. Morse, Director
