The basic equation governing the flow of heat in a body of
conductivity % is Laplace’s equation for heat flow which can
be written*

A = operator nabla which must be evaluated for particular co
ordinate system used.

This equation is practically impossible to solve as it stands
and it is usually simplified by making the assumptions that,
as far as the conductivity is concerned, the material is homo-
geneous (k independent of position) and isotropic (£ indepen-
dent of direction), and that % is independent of temperature.
Then the equation can be written

(2) Radiation

When heat is transferred between two surfaces, one at
T’y and the other at T, by radiation, the amount of heat trans-
ferred per unit area of surface in a unit time is

g = ((7‘14 T T'_"‘) (7)
C = a constant, dependent on effective emissivity and geometri-

cal shape of surfaces.
I'he temperatures are on the absolute scale.

! This formula has been derived from theoretical considera-
tions and thoroughly tested experimentally.

If an observer were to assume that he was measuring heat
erltlsfe.r by a means which obeyed the law of conduction
(f*quatlon (‘_’.)) whereas the heat was really transferred by radia-
tion acc.nr.dmg to equation (7), he would conclude that the
C(m(ll.lCFl\'.lt_\_' of the materials increased as 7%. This can be
seen 1f it is assumed that 7, and T’y are near enough together
so that equation (7) can be written as E ;

material reported in the literature, as has been shown in a
comparative test by six independent investigators on the
same material (Fig. 1). These results have been summarized
by Nicholls? and Austin,! who concluded that the differences
reported are due to the methods, even though any one
method has fairly good reproducibility. To obtain satisfactory
guarding for absolute measurements, quite large samples are
required. This proposes a difficulty in the study of high-
purity essentially nonporous ceramic materials, since large
specimens may be difficult to fabricate to desired specifica-
tions.

A method of insuring correct heat flow without the use of
heat guards is to employ a specimen which completely sur-
rounds the heat source. This may consist of an infinite cylin-
der or slab, surrounding an infinite heat source, or it may con-
sist of a hollow sphere or spheroid. Shapes approximating an
infinite cylinder or slab are satisfactory, if only the center
section is employed (in a manner equivalent to heat guards),
but they are difficult to fabricate from pure ceramic materials
to specifications. A spherical shape is satisfactory, but the
highly curved isothermals present a difficulty in temperature
measurement.

Loeb? has recently developed a general expression for the
body factor, B, in equation (2) for any shape where the sur-
faces can be described by a single parameter (» = constant)
in some orthogonal coordinate system and where the iso-
thermals are given by a single coordinate and the lines of
flow by the orthogonal coordinates. This expression 1S

The value of A will depend on the magnitude of the anharmonic
vibrations and the wave amplitude.

It seems apparent that any factor which decreases the mean
free path of the thermoelastic waves will tend to lower the
thermal conductivity. Most of these factors have been con-
sidered by Eucken® and Austin.! The major factor affecting
the mean free path is expected to be the symmetry and order
of the crystalline lattice. Materials having a simple cubic
lattice are expected to give rise to fewer anharmonic vibra-
tions and to have a higher conductivity than more complex
crystalline forms. Glassy structures having a disordered
structure will be expected to have very low thermal conduc-
tivities.® As an illustration of this, consider the thermal con-
ductivities of quartz crystals” and quartz glass® whose conduc-
tivities at —190°C. are 0.075 and 0.0016 cal. per sec. °C.
cm., respectively. These values give a value of mean free
path of about 12 a.u. for the fused quartz and about 700 a.u.
for the crystalline material.® Similarly, crystals having ap-
proximately the same size atomic weight components will in
general be expected to have higher conductivities than crys-
tals having components with a pronounced difference in
atomic weight. Eucken observed a maxima in conductivity
for the alkali halides which had approximately equal atomic
weights.®® Predictions based on this criterion must be ac-
