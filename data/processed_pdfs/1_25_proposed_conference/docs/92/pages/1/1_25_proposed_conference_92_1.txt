Dear Professor Morse:

 

THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
ANN ARBOR
DEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICS

May 25, 1959

Professor Philip M. Morse, Director
Computation Center

Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Cambridge 39, Massachusetts

Your letter to Mr. Arden requesting comments on the
organization of meetings for directors of computing centers
was forwarded to me. I am not certain that my comments have
any value to you in your survey. It might be more tactful for
me to withhold my remarks until I have acquired experience in
the administrative tasks that are unique with directors of
computers. |

My present reaction to the suggestion of specialized
meetings is very negative. I am looking toward the immediate
future with trepidation because of the magnitude of the task
that has been set before me. Therefore, I hesitate to commit
my time to activities other than those which are essential to the
work on campus.

~The I. B. M. conference in June conflicts with the U. of M.
1959 Summer Conference on the introduction to numerical analysis.
Since I am involved in the latter conference, it was not possible
to accept an invitation from I. B. M. to attend their meeting.
I will therefore miss the opportunity of discussing the subject
of your letter further with you at that time.

Very truly yours,

e.0-1 JBuc,

R. C. F. Bartels
