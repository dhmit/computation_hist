EQUIPMENT CHANGES

About the middle of August, the Center will install
an IBM 1301 Disk File as a high-speed auxiliary memory
device replacing the tape units on channel C of the 7090,
The installation of the Disk File should take several
days; the 7090 will not be in operation at this time.

Since proper use of this file by many users requires
a standard executive program, this device may become
available only on a limited basis and then only after the
Center is satisfied that the necessary subprograms are
available and checked out.
TIME ESTIMATES

The following is a revision of time estimates from
those published in BULLETIN 20: '

FORTRAN
.2 + .004n =â€˜miqutes/compilation
MAD olan
.1 + .0016n = minutes/compilation
FAP
.0004n = minutes/assembly
where n is the number of cards. When several compilations

in the same language are being done in one job, add the
following amounts to the calculations. For every additional

FORTRAN .07 minutes
MAD .1 minutes
FAP .04 minutes

Loading time for binary decks is 6000 cards/minute.
