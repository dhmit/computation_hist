Subjeet: Comment on your suggestions of this date.

Thanks for your comments and suggestlons. I honestly
appreciate having them; particularly on paper so that I have a
chance to study them carefully. 1 am extremely sorry that I have
not acquainted everyone with the research that has been going on
in my group, particularly since last November,

With respeect to the relocation register, at the end of last
year George Kovarik came up with a scheme to avoild a high speed
adder by using a relocation register of from l-7 bits as a prefix
for any effective address, add trapping if the "OR" combination
yielded any ones, I belleve that if I substituted "1" for "1-7",
this would be the same scheme that you have independently arrived
ats The hardware requirements are not great because, as you point
out, the changes in either case are minor. However, it does
require getting active acgcess to the MAR, so 1t ceannot be done
without internal chonges, The memory protection scheme, by the
wiy,. waicn I worked out last fall, would work with only a passive
reference to the MAR and did not require high speed elrecultry either,

The major obJection that I had to Kovarik's scheme was the
following:

_ If n bits were used for a prefix (in the 7090), then
Memory could only be broken up into 2R segments of size 215-n
with essentially only 2"%-1 fixed boundaries., This then leads to
the fellowing difficulties: Consider a program of from 214 = 215
words in length (slightly over 1/2 memory) if i1t coexists with
anything- (even = monitor routine), there is no way to proteet the
smaller frogments., This is an argument that holds 1f there is any
program shieh regulres 1/2 memory while being time shared. The
loss of memory argument (although diminished by 2-9) holds for a
general program requiring from 20 = ol  yords beecause I have to
preserve it 20+l spaces, and cannot safely put anything in the crack
which ean be from O = 20,
