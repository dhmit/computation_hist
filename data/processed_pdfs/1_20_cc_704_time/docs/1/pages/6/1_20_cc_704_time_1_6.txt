9. Does the programmer(s) intend to prepare the input cards?

10, If the answer to 8 or 9 is no, what plans have you?

SR v e T e e s R e bl
(Ordinarily, programming and card punching have to be done by the programmer. If
assistance is needed from the Center, special arrangements have to be made.)

11, When will program testing probably start?

12, Estimate of machine hours required for testing program:

13. Estimate of machine hours to complete production runs from tested program:

14, For cataloging purposes, how would you index this problem? For example, mathema-
tics, logic, game, etc. If this is a mathematical problem, specify type(s) such
as integration, partial differential equations, matrix theory, etc.

15, If this is a mathematical problem, specify numerical methods used, such as
Gauss' quadrature method, difference equations, Crout, etc.

16. On one or two additional sheets write sections A, B, and C as follows:

Section A: A one-paragraph abstract of Section B and C.

Section B: Complete description of problem background which should give com-
plete picture to someone well acquainted with the relevent
field of research. Give references to earlier or relateu work and
indicate relation to this work.

Section C: Description of numerical and computer techniques to be used, and
justification of their adequacy or indication of how adequacy is
to be determined. This description should include, when perti-
nent, the number of significant figures accuracy required at
various stages of the calculation and the ranges and values of
the quantities involved in sufficient detail so that program
complexity may be estimated, In addition, indicate how you
plan to test the programs and whether you have test cases
available,
