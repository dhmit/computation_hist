JOINT COMPUTER COMMITTEE
March 24, 1959
TO: Those Concerned with the Exchange of

Delegations in the Computer Field
with Russia

I have just sent the following cable. I will keep you informed of any further
progress of the negotiations.

Academician A. V. Topchiev

=" Vice President, USSR Academy of Sciences  «

Moscow, USSR (via RCA)

I am informed that 7 Soviet Scientists have applied for USA
visas for April 10. stop Before this can be approved, we must
have definite agreement on itineraries for their visit and for
our return visit. stop If my letter of December 24 is
acceptable, I can make arrangements for your delegation to
visit for 2 weeks starting April 19. I would then like our
return visit to start on May 10. Please cable your reply
immediately so that I have time to make final arrangements.
Please send your comments on the various questions raised

in my letter.

I would like to suggest as alternate dates that you come starting
May 31 just before the International Conference in Paris and we
go to Russia on June 21. This would enable us to combine trips.
