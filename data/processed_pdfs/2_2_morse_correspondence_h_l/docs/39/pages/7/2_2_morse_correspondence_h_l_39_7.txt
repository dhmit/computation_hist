obtained for magnesia 0.1 at 0°C. to 0.014 at 1100°C. For
alumina the values decrease from 0.025 at 0°C. to 0.010 at
1100°C. He assumed the crystals to be spherical, and mac!e

constitution. Fine, hairlike cracks or pores 11 the alumina
sample may account for the relatively low values obtained
for alumina.

No reference to a spheroidal type of apparatus such as used
for this study was discovered in the literature. Only refer-
ences to the spherical units previously mentim.\cd were en-
countered. Hering® has suggested hemispherical caps as
heat guards for the cylindrical method.

It was soon discovered that the hemispherical guards did
not eliminate nonradial flow entirely.! This distorted heat
flow was also revealed by the distorted discoloration markings
noticed in the insulating cover upon disassembly. It wasthen
decided to resort to the prolate spheroid where there are no
discontinuities in the curvature of the surface. The values
obtained with the cylindrical apparatus were then shown to
be very low as expected.
