It is always diﬂicult to calculate a potential ﬁeld distribution, even in relatively
simple physical systems, unless considerable approximations are made. This
is particularly true if the system involves electrical inhomogeneities or if the
boundary of the system is not a simple geometrical shape. It is usually possible,
however, to set up a model of the system and make rapid measurements of the
potential ﬁeld.

 

Fig. 1. Diagram of two-dimensional conductivity tunk. The outline of the chest wull, lungs, heart,
vertebra. and sternum can be seen, The two electrodes at the centre of the cl‘oss»section of the
heart are the source electrodes. The search electrode is carried on u bridge, to the right, and
can be moved to any position in the tank. The reference electrode is seen immediately behind
the vertebra. The cross-section is taken at the mid-ventricular level.

An electrolytic tank for conductivity measurements, as described by
Boothroyd, Cherry 8; Maker (1949), was modiﬁed (Fig. 1) so as to have an
insulating boundary in the shape of the outline of a cross-section of the human

thorax (adapted from oross<scction diagram 23 of Morton, Truex & Kellner
(1941)).
