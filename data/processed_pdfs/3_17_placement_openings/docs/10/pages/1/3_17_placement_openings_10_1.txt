Dear Dr, Morse:

As you know, Dr, Kenneth Ford of our Physics Department has been
serving as Brandeis University's representative to the IBM Computa-
tion Center, Since Dr, Ford will be leaving Brandeis for a year

to work in Europe, we should like to request that Dr, Max Chretien,
Chairman of our Physics Department, be accredited as Brandeis'
representative to the Computation Center effective September 1,
1961, We feel confident that Dr, Chretien will be an effective
replacement for Dr, Ford,

Your confirmation will be appreciated,
