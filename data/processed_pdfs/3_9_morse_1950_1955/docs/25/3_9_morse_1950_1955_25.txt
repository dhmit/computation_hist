Lear Professor Morse:

This letter is to confirm my discussion with
your secretary in which I arranged a tentative luncheon
meeting with Dr. E. P, Little, Flight Research Laboratory,
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, on Thursday, April © at
12 noon, As you know, this meeting was previously scheduled
for 1:30 p.m, on Thursday, but Dr. Little has indicated that
he will not be available in the afternoon,

We will not be able to definitely confirm this
luncheon meeting until Dr. Little arrives on Thursday a.m,
However, you are now alerted of his arrival, and we will
call you as early as possible on Thursday to make definite
arrangements,

Very truly yours,

Edna H., Tamm
Secretary
