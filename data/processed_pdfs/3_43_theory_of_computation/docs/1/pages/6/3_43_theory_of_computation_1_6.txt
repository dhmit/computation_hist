Let us evaluate 2! according to this definition,
We have

2'

(2=0 —*1.240 —+2-(2-1)3)
2.1!

2(1=0 1,140 —1.(1-1)")

= 2.1.0%

2.1.(0=0 —1,04 —0-(0-1)!)
2+1.1

=2

The recader who has followed these simple
examples is ready for the construction of C (QE_
which is a straightforward generalization of the
above together with a tying up of a few loose
ends,

Some Notation, Let ;;T’be a collection
(finite in the examples we shall give) of func-
tions whose domains and ranges are certain sets,
C gﬁ%} will be a class of functions involving the
same sets which we shall call computable in terms
of F ,

Suppose f is a function of n variables and
suppose that if we write y=f(xl,...,xn), each X

 

takes values in the set U, and y takes its value

i
in the set V, It is customary to describe this
situation by writing

The set le,,,:-:Un of n-tuplets (xl,...,xn) is
called the domain of f, and the set V is called
the range of £,

If all the variables occurring in a form

values of a function defined in this way, If

by composition from fl,...,fm. The class of

Partial Functions, In the theory of com-
putation it is necessary to deal with partial E
functions which are not defined for all n- f
tuplets in their domains, Thus we have the
partial function minus, defined by ‘f""?
minus (x,y)=x-y, which is definéd on those pairs
(x,y) of positive integers for which X <18
greater than y, A function which is defined
for all n-tuplets in its domain is called a
total function, We admit the limiting case of a
partial function which is not defined for any
n-tuplets, .

The n-tuplets for which a function de-
scribed by composition is defined is determined
in an obvious way from the sets of n-tuplets for
which the functions entering the composition
are defined, If all the functions occurring in
a composition are total functions, the new func-
tion is also a total function, but the other
processes for defining functions are not so kind
to totality, When the "function" is usecd
from here on, we shall mean partial function,

Having to introduce partial functions is a
