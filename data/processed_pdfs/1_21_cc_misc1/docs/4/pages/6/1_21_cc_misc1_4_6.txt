to be agreed upon; it is hoped that these may be based broadly
enough to apply to a wide range of future concordances, both in

Latin and in other languages, and covering a number of other
theologians,

The following sections outline (a) some of the anticipated
problems in preparing a Latin-language concordance by computer,
and (b) the general technical aspects of constructing such a com-=-

There are certain characteristics of the Latin language which
impede clear alphabetical sorting and selection of meaningful con-
texts by machine. In English, plurals of nouns give little trouble,
except for a few Anglo-Saxon survivals, Certain strong (drink,
drank, drunk) and irregular verbs (go, went, gone), and the per-
sonal pronouns afford some alphabetical displacement. The verb
to be causes problems in western European languages, The Greek
epsilon, (the imperfect tense prefix) and the general complexity of
Greek conjugation, for example, would raise greater problems
probably than Latin., Yet Latin has its share of difficult features,

First of all, word derivation from a common root causes a
mixing of parts of speech when strict alphabetization is followed.
This will be an acute difficulty in Calvin because of his fondness
for the use of related words--verbs, nouns, adjectives, and ad-
verbs, For example: efficere, effectus, efficax, efficacia;
appetere, appetitio, appetitus, appetentia. His style abounds in
abstract nouns (derived mainly from verbs). Thus, in alphabeti-
cal order one might find:

effectus (noun; perf. pass. s, part. of efficere)
efficacem (adj. m/f s. accus.)

efficacia (noun, nom or abl. sing.)

efficacibus (adj., dat. /abl. pl.)

efficere (vb,, inf.)

efficiam (vb., 1st s. fut act. ind.)

This example also illustrates in part the anomalies--~alpha -
betically considered--of the Latin inflectional system. Most acute
