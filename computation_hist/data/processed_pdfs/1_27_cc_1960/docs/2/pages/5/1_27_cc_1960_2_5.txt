It is not intended that the Center should have a monopoly
of all computing around MIT; this would be unrealistic and, as
indicated above, impossible; But it must play an active role in

is to continue to be the focus of new ideas and of exciting activity

which will attract, train and inspire the new generation of
machine experts.

Pro osal: It is proposed that some time during the summer
or fall of 1965 a 7090 be substituted for the present 70h. Details
of the specific equipment to be included are already under disw
cussion with IBM staff. Several data synchronizer channels should
be included, and a disk memory, in addition to a variety or input-
output equipment. In the meantime the Center staff will be preparing
pilot models of the substation, time-sharing consoles, and the
related program modifications so that the time-sharing aspects of
the research can start as soon as possible after the 7090 is
installedo The Center staff will of course continue its close

implications of the time-sharing developments will be available to
these groups as the work progresses, and so that minor changes in
the 7090, to improve substation effectivenessy can be made with

expedition and mutual understanding, either before or after the 7090
is delivered.

The total load on the 70903 the work of the cooperating
institutions, the class and thesis use and the machinewuse research
discussed above” would initially use more than one shift of machine
times but probably would not use more than two shifts for the first
yearn Consequently it would be possible for IBM» during the first
year of operation» to utilize the third shift in a manner similar
to what was done on the 704 during its first year of operation.

It is likely that this IBM usage would taper off, as it did with
the 7049 so that as the program outlined above expandsH it could
eventually use all three shifts (plus Saturdays); the New England
colleges taking up to one shift, the MIT classroom and thesis work
taking up to another shift,7 and the newmapplications research takizg
up the rest of the time. MIT would supply the operating and
programming staffg in addition to the management and coordination
with other colleges; IBM would supply maintenance” amortization of
building spacey support of the research assistantship program and
reimbursement of MITVS expenses in the cooperative program‘n as it
does at present with the 7040
