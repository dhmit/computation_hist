I am now preparing some figures which will serve as estimates of
probable expenditures inocurred by your two contracts during the next
fiscal periods Ve must bear in mind, however, that a great deal of work
was abserbed by the Air Force contract which is no longer available, and
therefore expenditures on the remaining contracts will of necessity be
higher, I shall discuss these latter matters with you at our nex%
meetinge.

Sincerely yours,

¥Fo Me Verzuh
