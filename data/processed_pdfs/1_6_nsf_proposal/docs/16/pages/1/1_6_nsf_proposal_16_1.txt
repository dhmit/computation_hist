PROPOSAIL FOR RESEARCH ON DIGITAL COMPUTER OPERATION
AND UTILIZATION AT THE NEW MIT COMPUTATION CENTER

We are organizing what should be one of the most fruitful
centers for research related to the use of electronic computers
in this country. IBM is contributing one of its T7O4 machines,
maintained and equipped with appropriate auxiliary equipment.

IBM and MIT are providing the building, part of the new Compton
Laboratory, and MIT is contributing some of the staff from its
departments of mathematics, electrical engineering, physics, and
industrial management. The machine will be avallable, 35 or more
hours a week, free of machine time charge, to MIT staff and students
for non-classified and non-routine research. MIT research in the
Center will be coordinated by the Institute Machine Computation
Committee (see Appendix  for names) .

In addition, the Center will be available, up to 35 hours a
week, on the same basis, to other colleges in New England. Already
23 institutions have indicated their interest in participating and
have appointed faculty members to be their ITnstitutional Representa-
tive (list of participating colleges and representatives given in
appendix ). These representatives will coordinate the research
done on the machine by students and staff of theilr institution.

IBM is providing some funds for stipends for graduate students who
wish to learn machine use by helping with some of this research.

In this atmosphere and with these facilities, there 1s an
unparalleled opportunity to do important and basic research in all

phases of the use of digital computers in science, englneering,
