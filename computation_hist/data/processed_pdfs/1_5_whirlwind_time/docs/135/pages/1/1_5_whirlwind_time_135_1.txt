Dean Arden will take over the technical direction of the
numerical onelysie and programing research activities of the group.
Consequently, he will be responsible for the technical supervision of
the .gt‘ﬂi‘. The size of the staff will be mintuned at a sufficiently
high level so that some traction of the staff time may be committed by

Verzuh‘for maintaining a satisfactory Rcmputing service.

It is expected that some of the overlapping responsibilities
will become more clearly defined and he reablved within a short time.

With these adjustments made, I feel that I will be able to
resign my D. I C appointment; on 3 September 1955

.I would like?» exyress m appreciation for the opportunity
of working with you and the other people here at MIT.
