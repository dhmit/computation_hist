Professor Philip M. Morse
Rm, 6-109
M.1I.T. :

Dear Phil:

I have received Mr. J. V. Porter's letter
of October 25 concerning the allocation of time on the
WWI computer. It was not clear to me how we should
proceed in trying to get an allowance of time for thesis
students. As you know, Mr. O'Donnell has been doing
his doctor's thesis work using the machine. He has had
a number of master's men doing associated theses which
have also required time on the computer. He has apparent-
ly had no difficulty in getting all the time that was
needed. He 1s essentially through his program but may
require a few more calculations made. These will only
need a very few hours of machine time. I have another
doctor's man, S. H. Davis, who is starting his program
and we would like to follow up O'Donnell's work. It
would be my guess that the total computer time he would
need would be of the order of magnitude of that used by
O'Donnell. If you would like a more definite statement
of the time, I could ask Jack O'Donnell to estimate the
total time he and the men associated with him have used
and give this as an estimate for Davis. The Department
can support Davis with a fellowship but we do not have
any funds to pay for the computation, although, if this
is a critical matter, we might be able to go out to
industry and find a company that would give us a grant,

Can you let me know how we should proceed?

Yours sincerely
