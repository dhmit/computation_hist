Enclosed are the solutions obtained by our new Differential
Analyzer for the "Kinetic Theory"™ problem:

4X = p - kx + (1-e7Y)
du

§§ = kx - (1-e77)

For our convénienge we have let z he:

-~ d dx
szt g w]l Pk e] FD -
" . du P du

All combinetions of the values:
p=0,1/4, 1/2, 1 x =0,1, 2
k= 0, 1/2, 1 Yo = 0s 1, 2
have been used as shown in the "List of Solutions".
We have plotted X VSe U and\z’vs. u and tabulated x,_¥? Z, and

e'y vse u. The scale factors to be applied to the tebulated columns are
the same in all solutions and ere as shown on Fun #1, 1e0

 

10000t, 1000x, IOOOy, 4000z, and 4000e™Y respectively.

We have checked all of the solutions for accurazy in the follow=-
ing weys:

and for large values of u and y:
3. x,,—‘"ile(1+p);

O¢ Vie also checked the generation of the exponential e v,
