Dear Leon:

 

 

bac Y enclose a press release on the donation by ok
IBM of the 704%, which should get here about January 1957.
This generous arrangement will make available to us, and

to other universities in New England, an up-to-date

digital computer without operating or maintenance cost.

To be a truly effective instrument for research, however,

we must also have a research staff to develop, in connec-
tion with the machine, a better understanding of coding
logic, and techniques of programming and numerical analysis,
to investigate procedures for recording and machine process-
ing of large-quantity experimental data, including programs
for its statistical analysis and its display in quickly gat
understandable form and to prepare manuals and Sub-routines
for use with this and other machines.

I believe 1% would be appropriate for NSF to
support a part of the expenses of such a research group,
to the tune of about F100,000 for three years (225,000
starting July 1956 and about £35,000 for each of the
succeeding two years) and I am requesting a policy decision
on this in the near future. I will let you know soon what
the outcome is.

Yours, i Pr Ja
Philip M. Morse
