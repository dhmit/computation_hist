Dear Phil,

At the meeting in Poughkeepsie
you expressed some interest in the computing
work we intend doing on the BCS theory,
so I thought you might like to look at
this application before, please, forwarding
it to Frank Verzuh for prosessing,

I haven't been able to get up to
M,.I. T, to see you since we have been more
than usually busy due to the arrangements
for the 7070, the order for which was
signed yesterday., Please keep this confiden-
tial, since the announcement of the N,S.F,
grant hasn't been made yet - it should
come within a week, It will be nice having
a machine with interchangable tapes with
the 704,

I hope to see you next week -

as ever
