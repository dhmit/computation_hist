Dear Professor Morse:

In accordance with our conversation of last week, I am sending
you a copy of the letter concerning ONE policy on payment of
publication costs.

When you have decided what steps you would like to take, I

would be glad to have you call me or Mr. A. J. Efise. Mr. Wise
is on MIT extension 2581.

Sincerely yours,

cam
