Whirlvird Project has now reached a stage or development
where its potentlalitle$_can be utilized, together with the other
computing egulpgent at lechnology, in a coordinated regegrch and
training program, or the sort anticipateﬁ by ORB durlng its
several years of support of ﬁhe Project. Both the Institute and
the NaVy are vitally interested in the use of largevscale com-
puting devices (or the solution of scientific and engineering
problems, and for the promotion of training for students inter—
ested in_this field.

Of course a part of the time of Whirlwind will be used
for the solution of a special Air Force problem, and it is ex-
pected that the Air Force will conxribute an appreciable part of
the support of the Whirlwind Project, for the development of
equipment and methods for the solution of this problem. Neverthe-
less, approximately half the working time of the machine itself

will be available for the fundamental grogram, dentioned above and

outlined below.
