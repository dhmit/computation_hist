I.B.Me=M,I.T. Contractsfor a Computing Center
(Notes for Discussion)

I. Building Contract.

1. The International Business Machines Corporation and
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology desire to enter into
an agreement whereby M.I,T. would use its own funds to erect
space for a Computing Center. In return, I.B.M. would agree to
make annual grants to M.I,T. over a ten year period, the amount
of each annual grant to be that required to make a total capital
gift of $400,000 in ten years, plus interest at the rate of

four per cent per annum on the unamortized balance.

2. Space for the Computing Center will be provided by
adding two additional bays, full fonien, to the north end of
the Karl Taylor Compton Laboratories (now under construction)
plus 2 west extension approximately 36 feet by 90 feet con
sisting of a basement and first floor only. This will provide
approximately 18,000 sq. ft. gross of space. The Center will
not occupy all of the space so constructed but will trade space
with other occupants of the building in order to locate all of

the Center's activities on the first and second floors and in

 

the basement. The minimum space provided for the Center,

however, will be approximately 18,000 sq. ft., gross.

3¢ M.I.T. will agree to pay all costs for the addition
of the above space to the Karl Taylor Compton Laboratories,
including special power supplies and air conditioning for the
Machine Computation Room in the Center in return for the above

described grants from I1.B.M.

4» The space provided for in this agreement will be
devoted to teaching and research in the field of machine methods
of computation. M.I.T. will agree to make the space available
for these purposes for the duration of the agreement, with
continuation beyond that subject to mutual agreement, except
that IBM reserves the right to cancel the agreement at any time
by paying the balance of its obligations. Similarly, MIT may
Cancel the agreement by releasing IBM from its remaining

financial obligations.

II. Operating Contract.

l. IBM agrees to provide for the Computing Center
without cost to MIT, a Type 704 Electronic Data Processing
Machine with all necessary auxiliary operating equipment.

By mutual agreement, IBM may at any time substitute or add a
machine or machines. All machines so provided will remain

the property of IBM.

2+ All machines which are & part of the Computing

Center will be available for use by MIT for teaching and re-

search for seven hours each day. MIT agrees to make these

machines available for similar use by nearby educational
institutions for up to an additional seven hours each day

on a no-profit, no-loss basis to MIT.

3. In return for (1) providing funds for erection of
suitable space for the computation center as described in the
Building Contract, (2), for making the machines available to
MIT and other educational institutions without cost, and (3),
for making grants to cover operating costs of the Computing
Center as described below, MIT agrees that IBM should use the
machines for a maximum of 10 hours each day on 2 night shift

for the solution of its own problems.

Le IBM agrees to provide maintenance and service on

all of its machines in the Computing Center.

5. IBM agrees to make annual grants to MIT to cover
the following costs in connection with the operation of the
Computing Centers

l. Maintenance, upkeep and repairs
on the space occupied by the Center.

2. Heat, light and power, including
special power required for the machines and
for air conditioning. In instances where
costs cannot be determined directly, they
will be estimated on the basis of average

costs for the entire MIT plant.

3. Salaries for a core programming
staff for both MIT and other participating
universities. This staff will be available
part-time for teaching students and others
how to put problems on the mechines and part-
time for research in the programming field.
Fach member of this group will receive an.
appointment from MIT as an IBM Research
Assistant or an IBM Research Associate, de-
pending upon his qualifications and training.
MIT hopes that the participating universities
will provide up tc half of the members of

this group.

operating personnel

5. Expendable materials used in ‘the

operation of the Center,

IBM agrees to pay all expenses associated with the

operation of the Center during the 10-hour period each day

when it is being used for the solution of IBM problems.

Te

MIT egrees that the use of the machines in the

Center shall be confined to teaching and basic research, and

that the machines will not be used for the solution of routine

problems which do not materially contribute either to the ad-
vancement of science and engineering, or to a better understanding
of the applicability of high speed computing machines to
scientific, engineering, business or financial problems. The
Director of the Computing Center will determine the program

for use of the machines, but with the advice of an Advisory
Committee composed of one representative from each of the
participating universities that wishes to designate a member.

In general, no problems will be accepted for solution on the
machines unless the results are expected to be incorporated in

a publication.

8. The nearby universities that will be invited to
participate in the use of the machines in the Computing Center
will be determined by mutual agreement between IBM and MIT.

In general, however, they will include all institutions of
higher learning in the New England area that have suitable
problems that can be solved within the limits of available

time.
