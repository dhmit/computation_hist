of the leading edges. The traces of the boundary and shock wave have been shown
mainly to clarify the preceding example. They really have no immediate bearing on the
interaction example, since it will be necessary to consider the possibility of having to
reduce the amount of expansion and the extents of the interacting simple waves. The

boundary will actually be constructed later. The essential point is that the discussion
starts from simple waves in which all 0 the straight characteristics pass through the
centers ER or E1, .

In Fig. 4 the simple waves have not eguu to interact so the boundary need not be
altered for z < 0. In Fig, 5 they begin to inﬂuence each other along the characteristics
