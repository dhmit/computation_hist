Dear Mr. Rusk:

Think nothing of it; we noticed it but
weren't worried. As a matter of fact the baslc
trouble was that we got the pleture to you at the
last minute, as I remember.

: "If there 1s anything you might need for
the next report, please let me know early, so 1
can get it to you well before deadline this time!

Yours,

Philip M. Morse
Director

PMM: LWH
