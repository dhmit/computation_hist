since the IRA Corporation group will have held a. closed meeting
during the morning, there is obviously a possibility of duplication oz effort.
Accordingly, the tine allotted for each talk has been limited to approximately
15 minutes, and this may be expanded as questions indicate need for it In
other words, we will have to play it somewhat by ear.
