Dear Professor Morse:

The substance of the information I obtained in Philadelphia is that
the General Electric plant in Lynn will obtain a 704 machine in Sept-her, 1956.
I was told that some of the time would be made available for use by
educational institutions in the vicinity and the implication was that this

would be free of cost.

The man in chaï¬‚e is Allen Benson, Building 32, Riverworks Plant, General
Electric, Lynn, Massachusetts.

Sine say-sly yours ,

WWM
