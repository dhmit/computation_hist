To obtain from this boundary a ﬁnite obstacle resembling an airplane, symmetrically
terminate the wing, as in Fig. 3, at a trailing edge which is supersonic With respect to the
uniform ﬂows adjacent to both sides of the wing. 0n the lower side there will be an ex—
pansion around the trailing edges. The ﬂow ﬁeld just described will be unaffected up to
the ﬁrst Mach surface in the expansion fan emanating from the trailing edges. In par-
ticular, the leading edge shock will cease to be plane at its intersection with this surface
On the upper side there will be a shock attached to the trailing edges, ahead of which

the original ﬂow will be unaltered. If the trailing edges are straight, as in Fig. 3, the
shock and immediately following flow for either half of the wing will be conical with
respect to the corresponding wing tipi Possible trailing edges for the ﬁn would be its
intersections with the trailing edge shocks. If a thick wing is desired, the upper surfaces
need not be parallel to the lower surfaces, Finally the upper surfaces need not even be
plane, but may be cylindrical or even conical, with vortices at the Wing tipsi However,
after such changes the simple wave ﬂows cease to be conical with respect to the origin.

of the ﬁrst paragraph of Section 3. Examination of F' . 1 shows that cross sections by
the planes 2 = :1: 1 would have the appearances of Figs. 4 and 5. ER and EL are traces
