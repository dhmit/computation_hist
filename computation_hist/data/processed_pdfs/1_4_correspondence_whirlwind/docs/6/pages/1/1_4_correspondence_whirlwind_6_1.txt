In accordance with our budget discussions with Mr. Fs G. Weyl,ONR;
ave prepared & 6-month summary of ONR usage of WWi. The attached

T h
- 4-pege table contains a brealkdown of WW1 usage on the project basis.
~ . .

During this 6~-month interval, ONR's "free time"™ usage of Wl
breaks down es followss

 

‘&, Machine Computstion Comittes 24,708.63
bo Solid State and Moleoular Theory (Slater) 29,082,74
Co Miscellaneous projects 21,232,112

| $75,083.49

The totael machine usage during this Gmonth period for this type of
work is 18,006.6 minutes, oy epproximately 300 hours,

I think the informetion conteinad in the following table, such as
problem number, titls, programmer, W.Il.T. Depertment, supsrvisor, '
DIC contract number, ONR contrach., minutes used, and “free time" dollar
value, should give Mr. Weyl all ths information he needs for budget
discussionso

A consideration of the abtbached statistics reveals several ltems
which are worthy of mentione - Specifically, some of the thesis ressarch
is quite expensive as illustrated in the case of Jack Uretsky's
problem 236 in which he has spent $13,926 during a 6-month period. As
- matter of fact, he has spent $18,132,.70 on this problsm since
Wovember, 1954, Similarly, B. Campbell has spent $12,834. on problem 245
during this 6=-month period, and $15,865.,35 since November, 1864,
Likewise, Mr. K. Bryan has spent {1,870 during the pasit six months and
a total of $19,941.60 since November, 1954, I think the G-month expenditure
of Slater's group == $29,092.74 is a fair indicabion of the .efforts of "
his groupe Furthermore, his group has spent $47,944.25 since '
