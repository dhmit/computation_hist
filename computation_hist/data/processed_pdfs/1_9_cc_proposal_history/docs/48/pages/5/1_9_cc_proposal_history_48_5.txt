IBM-MIT Contract for a Computing Center Â«5-

problems which do not materially contribute either to the ad-
vancement of science and engineering, or to @ better understanding
of the applicability of high speed computing machines to
scientific, engineering, business or financial problems. The
Director of the Computing Center will determine the program

for use of the machines, but with the advice of an Advisory
Committee composed of one representative from each of the
participating universities that wishes to designate a member.

In general, no problems will be accepted for solution on the
machines unless the results are expected to be incorporated in

a publication.

8. The nearby universities that will be invited to
participate in the use of the machines in the Computing Center
will be determined by mutual agreement between IBM and MIT.

In general, however, they will include all institutions of
higher lesrning in the New England area that have suitable
problems that can be solved within the limits of available

time.
