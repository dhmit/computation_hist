Vs = potential at a point on the boundary of the ellipse.

uy, v = elliptical coordinates of a point on the boundary.

u', v = elliptical coordinates of the source.

The elliptical coordinates of a point can be found from?!

where 7; and 7, are the distances from the foci of the ellipse to the point in
question, and 2C is the distance hetween the foci. In FIGURE 2 the circles
represent values of potential measured around the boundary of the thorax
section fora B angle of 0°, and the crosses are values calculated from EQUATION
12. For values of 8 equal to 30°, 60°, and 90° the agreement was not quite
as good as this, but it was still within 10 per cent. The shapes of the measured
and calculated curves agreed very closely, but the curves were shifted relative
to each other. This may signify that the reference electrode was not exactly
at zero potential. The field due to any number of sources and sinks can be
obtained from EQUATION 12 by superposition.

The equation for the potential at any point inside the ellipse due to a source
and sink at any two points is more complicated than EQuaTION 12, but is still
expressed in finite form. Thus the potential due to a source alone is given by

V.= —4 In [cosh (u + #') — cos (v + v')] [cosh (¥ — %) — cos (v — v')]

[cosh (2ug — u + u’) — cos (v + v')] [cosh (2uo — u — u’) — cos (v — )]
[cosh (2uy + u — u’) — cos (v + v')] [cosh (2uo + u + u’) — cos (v — )]
[cosh (4uy — u — ') — cos (v + v')] [cosh (4uo — u + u') — cos (v — v')]

In this equation, # and v are the coordinates of the point for which the potential
is required. A similar expression holds for the sink, using #”, and v” instead
of #' and 7.

To illustrate the use of EQuATION 12 and the method of finding % and v, the
potential expression is derived for the conditions of FIGURE 1. To ﬁnd’ the
value of u, , any point on the boundary can be used. Taking the point x =
+A4 = 16.5 and using EQUATION 13,

26 + 7
h = eee— =
cosh g T 1.74
%o = 1.15

Since from the definition of an ellipse, 7, + 7, = constant, the same value of
uo would be obtained for any other point on the boundary. For the source,

h# = =
cosh % 0 1.185
' = 0.60
and from EQuATION 14
e
oSy — ST 0.174
v = —80°

The minus sign for v* is explained by the fact that the range of v is approxi-
mately the same as the corresponding polar angle. Thus in FIGURE 1, v has a
value between 0° and 90° in the first quadrant of the x, y plane, between 90°
and 180° in the second quadrant,etc. Since the source is in the fourth quad-
rant, it must lie in the range of 0° to —90°. For the sink,

u” = 0.60
v = —100° = —(r + ?)
Substituting the values in EQuaTION 12, with 4 = 1.0,
Vit [2.96 + cos (v + 80°):| [1.16 + cos (v — 80°)]
2.96 — cos (» — 80°) 1.16 — cos (v + 80°)
867 + cos (v + 80°)] [28.7 + cos (v — 80°):|
8.67 — cos (v — 80°) 28.7 — cos (v + 80°)

To find V, for any point, v is found from EQUATION 14 and used in EQUATION
16. Thus, forx = +A4,v = 0°. Then V, = In 1.59 = 0.46 v. The meas-
ured value of potential at this point is 0.47 v.

Two other equations that are useful in converting between elliptical and
rectangular coordinates are
