Sub ject: High-Speed Computing Equipment for the Institute,
a Proposal

Reguirements - The Institute needs a service computing center,
equipped with modern high-speed computing machines administered
by a service staff, in order to carry forward its educational pro-
gram in three general flelds:

(a) General Educational Research - Many engineering
and scientific research problems carried on by students and staff
require the help of high-speed computing equipment to carry out
the related calculations. Many industries, hiring our graduates,
- prefer to hire men who have had some experience in using such
equipment.

is a leader in e development of Bpecial control equipment (as,

for example, the automatic milling machine) which often involves

the design of specilal-purpose computers. In many cases, the ini-
tial part of the development 1s facllitated by being able to try

out ideas on a general-purpose computer.

(b) Development of Control Equipment - The Institute

(c) Busiriess Data Handling and Operations Research -
A very promising field of machine application i in business adminis-
tration. The end products will often be special-purpcse machines
(for handling bank deposits or insurance premiums, or the 1like),

but much of the development can use a general-purpose computer to

try out ideas. 1In addition, many production-scheduling and other
operations research problems of business and industry need a high-
speed computer for their solution.

Already fthe regquirements for machine time for thesis
work and for general faculty research in these categories occupy
about half the time of a high-speed machine. In addition, four
courses (6.25, 6.535, 6.538, 16.91) involve training in machine
coding and require a falr amount of machine time for the astudents;
another dozen or more related courses could use some machine time
if it were available. (See Appendix A.) Over and beyond these,
primarily educational, needs are the computing requirements of the
various DIC and DDL proJjects, which could use up all the time of
a machine by themselves. However, such projects can well afford
