Washington, D. 0.

Dear Dr. Weyl:

In accordance with our telephone conversation last week,
I an sending you our most recent estimte of plans and costs of
operation of Whirlwind I for the next two years. This can be taken.
up in two parts: the one concerning the operation of Whirlwind I
and the support of its necessary maintenance, programing and ad-
ministrative staff (DIG project 63115); the other concerning the
general research and training program designed to extend the use
of digital computers in scientific and engineering research at the
Institute (DIG project 6915).

Project 1 - Taking up the second part first; the goal
set up in our s proposals to cm, to make faculty and students
aware of the usefulness of high-speed digital computers by investi-
gating applications in many fields, is well on its way to attain-
ment. Graduate students and faculty supervisors in nest departments
or the Institute.(Biology being the major exception) have investi-
gated applications of machine methods to problems in their own
fields and are in the process of obtaining results worthy of pub-
lication in their ovm field 's Journals. This art of the program
was originally set up for a yearly budget of 100,000, but the
rate was reduced to $80,000, at the request of one, before the
proJect had reached its originally planned full strength. It is
now estimated that about $70,000 will remain in the budget of this
project by June 30, 1955; consequently, it will be able to continue,
at about its present level of activity, for only one further year,
unless further funds are provided.

But it is quite possible that most of the sins of such
a general research pregame will have been attained by June 1956

18$ the worthwhile parts then active should each be supported,
aperste pro acts. by funds from various sources. ﬂow that the
,sibilities o uchine use are known by faculty and students,
.rther support of research using machines can perhaps be provided
an the strength of the importance of the research itself, rather
than because of its interest as a problem in machine coding. Sons
of these research projects may be supported by industry, soue may
still need support from OER, but the support need not all cone from
the lathenatics Division of ORR: the other divisions, interested
in the research, should contribute their share. Consequently, no
additional funds will be requested for D10 6915 at this the. Next
summer the situation will be res-assessed and a final decision as to
its future will then be made.

Project 6 - The situation with respect to Die 633‘s,
the operat on 0 wind I itself. is quite otherWise. This

equipment is the only highvspeed digital computer available at
present for general research at the Institute. Unless enough
funds are available to pay for maintenance, operation; pro

and scheduling. no research requiring machine amputation of this
sort will be possible at the Institute and the goal set by the
other part, project 6915. would be nullified. At present W1 is
supported in part by Lincoln laboratory and in part by one. The
tine not used by Lincoln, which is used by workers in project 6955
and fin-tho general research and educational activities of the In-
stitute, is equivalent to about #0 hours a week, full oneahift
operation of the machine. The cost: not born by Lincoln have been
trimmed to about $160,000 per year. "ﬁe problen is how to‘ provide
this anmmt during June l955-June 1956 and how to, provide the -
largertancunt to keep going later 12 Lincoln should withdraw its
supper . -

_ . One possibility would be to charge each user proportionally ‘
to his use of the machine, irrespective of the nature of his work.
This, of course, would have theggzgcsult of discouraging most thesis
research and general faculty use “of the machine, thus nullifying
the insults of the efforts of project 6915, which was set up, in
part, to stimulate this interest. Another possibility would be
to charge those users who could afford it (the sponsored projects)
enough to pay for the full $160,000 needed for the next fiscal

.,year and to allow thesis and general educational research free time.
