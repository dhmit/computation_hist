Dear Phil,

It was nice to hear from you. The
respomse to the Report has been enormous
and of the 650 copies run. off, we have one
left and arekhannelling all further re-
quests to Arthur Grad, to whom we sent
100. When these are exhausted, too,
reprints of the Comm. ACM article may
have become available.

I have just had your announcement of
the Institutional Representatives meeting
on October 14, and I am Very sorry to say
that we have long ago scheduled a collo-
quium for that afternoon, with lunch for
the speaker. I am afraid T shall, in all
probability, not be able to come, there-
fore. You will, I think,want to change
the representation on the advisory com-
mittee, so may I ask you to vote for me
as you choose?

Best regards.
Sincerely yours,
