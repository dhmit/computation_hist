Dear Professor Morse,

1 was very glad to receive the Progress Reports
of your Laboratory. In return, I am sending you now
several Reports recently published by our Institute.
I hope me shall continue with our exchange of scien-
tific publications.

I would highly appreciate your sending me toge-
ther with further Progress Reports any other of your
publications dealing with applied mathematics, prog-

ramming or computing technique.

Yours sincerely,
