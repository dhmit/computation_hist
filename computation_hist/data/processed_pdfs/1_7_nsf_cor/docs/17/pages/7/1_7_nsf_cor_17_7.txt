8. Investigation of techniques for intercommunication
between computers, including the possibility of cycles different
in length or kind running simultaneously\with frequent comparison,
e.g.£ several single-accumulator computers with commOn memory,and
the behavior of a computer with multiple accumulators. Some of
these properties can be simulated on a 70#\by utilization of
aﬂﬂitionai drums and magnetic core banks.

9. eumputer estimation of problem times In linear problems,
estimations of bounds of certain functionals, Sid thence conver-
gence criteria for terminating iteration, or s \tching to a
different iteration.

 

Facilities:

 

The MIT Computation Center will have a Type 704 lectronic
Data Processing Machine with the following machine com lement:
12 magnetic tape units, 2 magnetic core storage units c taining
a total of 8,000 words, 1 magnetic drum unit containing
words of storage,'the usual onvline punched card reader,
betic printer, and punched card recorder as well as the 3 ‘
magnetic—tape-controlled printer, magnetic-tape—controlled rd
punch, and punched card~to-magnetic tape converter, respecti 1y.
In addition to the 70% there will be 10 auxiliary punched car
machines including card punches, gellators, sorters, reproduce
a interpreters, and the Type 40; Accounting Machine. The aggrega
% machine rental, in excess of 50,000 per month, will be donated
by IBM.

 
 
 
  
  

 

 

The Type 704 EDPM unit is one of the fastest large-scale !
commercial computers available today. Sincd the MIT installation
will be but one of many in the field, techniques, programs, and
numerical procedures developed for this machine will be of use
to others having access to 704 equipment.

Personnel - Supervisory and Administrative Personnel Associated
with the Project:

Principal Investigator to be Professor Philip M. Morse,
Director of the Computation Center. He has been in contact with
computing problems during his career in theoretical physics since
1930, and with the use of computing equipment since the first
Bush differential analyzer was available at MIT in 1936. He got
his Ph.D. in physics at Princeton in 1929 and has been at MIT since
1931, with occasional leaves of absence. His publications include
the books "Quantum Mechanics" (with E. U. Condom) 1930, "Vibration
and Sound" 1936, "Methods of Operations Research" (with c. E.
Kimball) 1950, "Methods of Theoretical Physics" (with Herman
Feshbach) 1953, and ”Queuing, Inventory and Maintenance" 1957,
and about a hundred Journal articles, many of which give results
obtained from machine computation. For further biographic details

see "Who's Who". Only a fraction of his salary will be charged to
the Project.
