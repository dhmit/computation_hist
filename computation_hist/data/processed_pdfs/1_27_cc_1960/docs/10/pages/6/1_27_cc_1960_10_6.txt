fications so that the time-sharing aspects of the research can
start as soon as possible after th e 7090 is installed,
1 total load on the 7090, the worlk of the cooverating
institutions, the class and thesis use and the machine-use
research discussed above, would in nitially use more than one shift
of machine time, but probably would not use more than ‘“wo shifts
for the first year, Comnseguently it would be possible for IR,

ilize the thr&.:hift in

a manner similar to what was done on the 704 during its Mrst year

of operation. LT is likely that this IBM usage would taper off, )
as it did with the 704, so that as the program outlinei abuve

expands, it coull eventually use all tarece shifts (plus Satuvdays);

the Uew “ngland colleges taking up to one shift, the :I? clasi-

room and thesis work taking up to another shift, and the new-
