Dear Mr, Gans:
In accordance with our discussion at our conference
in New York on Thursday, October 11th, I promised Mr, Saul Haber

an additional copy of the 704 Machine Room layout which I prepared
on July 6, 1856, A copy of this layout is enclesed herewith,

You have received copies of this layout from
Carl Peterson, but apparently Mr, Haber had. not seen it, I think
you should make a SOM drawing of this to include in your group
for the MIT Computation Center,

Sincerely yours,
