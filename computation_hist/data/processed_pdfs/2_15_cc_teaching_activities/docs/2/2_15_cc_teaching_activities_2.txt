Dear Dr. Morse :

On behalf of the Penn Jersey Transportation Study I
should like to request your assistance once again in recruit—
ing a person with a background in operations research,
programming, and research design.

PJ has been asked to help offic _s in the State of
Delaware in the recruitment of a spe list to work in the
general field of data processing, data collection, and
research design. This person would undertake broad research
and planning in transportation, land use, and metropolitan
function. For the first six months or so of his time in
this posi ion he would report to the PJ offices in Philadel—
phia where he x-zould assist in programing and research
planning in such a way as to become Widel;r acquainted with
the work going; forward at PJ. Thereafter he Iioulll suoervise
the data. collection and research aspects of a counternart
study to PJ in Wilmington, attempting to br m: data for the
will- .5ton Standard Metropolitan Statistical urea uo to the
level attained 1 PJ. "

 

 

 

 

 

 

c.—

It is ultimately anticinated t' the Delaware Study
ind the PJ Study will be consolidated into a single I’JD arency,
headquartered in Philadelphia. There is a further lone—term
prospect that PJD will become a re, ional data center
continuin he development of regional research and me
politan models.

should be in the range of $13,000 to $114,000 depending; on qualifications.

At this time, we are also trying to fill both a senior and a junior
position in economics. The persons we are looking for should have a good
background in statistics and preferably some computer experience. Train—
ing in urban or regional economics is desirable but not essential. The
positions are continuing ones, the salary range for the senior position
being $10,000 - $12,000 per year, and for the junior position $8,000 —
$10,000 per year. The major problem areas in economics are the develop-
ment of several mdustry location models, an employment projection model,
and similar regional analyses.

We believe that these positions represent an outstanding opportunity
for competent and imaginative persons. I would appreciate any suggestions
you could make as to persons who might be interested in and qualified for
these positions.
