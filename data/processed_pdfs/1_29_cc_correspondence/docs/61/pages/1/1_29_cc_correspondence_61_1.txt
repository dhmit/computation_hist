Section D, Computation Center Quarterly Progress Report

During this guarter we completed our routline for computing
waiting-line probabilities in the case of two-phase
exponential servicing. When production runs were attempted,
however, the "significant-figure check" built into our
routine indicated that the results could not be guaranteed
to five decimal places on runs with more than five servicing
facilities. The results may be right, since the check 18 a
crude lower bound on the number of significant figures, and
not a precise estimate of the number of significant flgures.
We are trying to devise an independent check on the accuracy
of our results, with the intention of adding thls check to
our routine.

We have completed the programming of a computation of
walting-line probabilities for the case of constant servicing
time. This program has to be coded and debugged in the next
quarter, but should not offer any difficulty. A mimeographed
sheet giving a deseription of this program will be forwarded
to the Computation Center in two weeks and form an addition
to Part C.
