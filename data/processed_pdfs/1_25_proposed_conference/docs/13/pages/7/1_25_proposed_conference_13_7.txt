{Many coulerees fali that such an inter-departmental advisory committee is always

a desideratam.} Ia general it was agreed that clasercom use of the machine should have
firat priority {within certain limits, of course) and that priorities on research time
should not favor the paylng users, if there are any.

it alse wos generally agreed that university computing centers should run, 28
far as possible, on an "open-shop" basis, i.e., that the users should program and code
their own problems and, as far as in appropriate with the equipment, should participate
in running the problem on the machine. The task of the center stafl, therefore, should
not be to encode problems for machine users, but should be to instruct in coding and
advise on programming, to maintain a lbrary of standard programs and sub-routines
and te develop machine and programming techaigues which will make the computer
more effective and easier to use., In exchange for their use of the machine, the users
should be expected to document the new programs which they have developed, eo they
can be incorperated into the program library, being lested and re-written by the ceanter
staff, it important enough. It should be smphasized that this tagk of instructing,
advising, improving utility of the machine and keeping the program library up~to-date,
requires staff time of senior academic calibre, as well as machine time.

G. Instruction and Research - Nearly 90 percent of the directors atitending the
conference had academic tenure. This is appropriate, for much of the task of the
computing ceater in 2 university is related to instruction, either in teaching new users
the elements of coding, or ia advising how to program difficult problems or in teaching
or helping to teach courses related to computer science. The elements of coding are
now simple enough so that an under-graduate, with little more than high-school mathe-
matics can begin to use a particular machine after a few hours of instruction (after which

he continues to learn additionz] instruction and practice, of course.) Many ceanters give
