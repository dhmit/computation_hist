agreement, for example, that a one-term course on punch card equip-
ment of the sort proposed by Vbrzuh was probably desirable, though
it was not certain how much ﬂemand there was for such a course- at

ar y. ‘

weanesday, Decembe? 3. Morse said he hoped that Professor Brown
would be present then so that the subject of courses could be con«

tinned.
