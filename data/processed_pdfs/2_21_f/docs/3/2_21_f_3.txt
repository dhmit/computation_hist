Dear Mr, Shubik:

Professor Morse has shown me your letter of January 6th in
which you requested information on the growth and nature of computer
usage at our installation,

We feel that most of this information can be found in our
Semi-Annual Report, and I am enclosing a copy of our most recent one,
If you wish any of the earlier reports, we shall be glad to make these
available at your request,

1f you wish to come to MIT for a visit at some later date,
Professor Morse has indicated that he would be glad to see you at that
time, In addition, I would like to add on my own behalf that I would
be willing to discuss any topics which interest you,

Sincerely,

P. J. Corbato
