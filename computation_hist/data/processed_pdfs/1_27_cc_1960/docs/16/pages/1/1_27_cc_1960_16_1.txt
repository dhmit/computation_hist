Subject: Integration of Remote Console — Time Shared 7090 System (
Operation into MD I. T‘s Educational Facilities

1. Baogggound:
As part of our general preparation for the 7090 system, we

have been actively exploring the use of time - shared multipro-
gramming, with one or many input-output devices connected.. We
have successfully demonstrated with our flexowriter proJect that
time - sharing is a feasable method of running and testing pro-
grams. ,

As M. I. T. explores more deeply the problems of teaching and
research, computers are certain to have more applicability as a
teaching and research tool. This need will be fulfilled either by
providing a large number of relatively slow, limited capability com—
puting systems spread throughout classrooms and departments or the
Institute; through time - shared usage of a large, fast, and versa-
tile system such as the 7090, or perhaps via a combination of both°

Based upon available information, the Committee assigned to
study this problem; namely, F. J. Corbato, J. McCarthy, and H. M.
Tagger, recommend quite strongly that the possibility of a remote-
COnsole time shared 7090 system be breached withapproprlate asthorities at at
early date, as an area deserving support improvement of teaching
facilities,and techniques.

2° Specifications for the Proposed System:
At present, we are distinctly handicapped with respect to a

detailed understanding of the 7090 10 is and construction,* Lack-
ing such information, it is extremely difficult to express feasa-
bility in terms of cost, or any other terms other than "We know how
to do it and we feel it will be a better solution than a multitude
of small machines"u

Basically, the system would be comprised of a 7090, several
disc files, 5 - 10 remote inquiry stations similar to the 7070
system stations {electric typewriters and some push buttons) , and
sufficient channels and electronic hardware to make the system work"
some of the 7emote Lecture Hall stations would, in addition, be
equipped with self maintaining scope - displays and light pens.

s This is a policy matter that we feel should be broached at a high
Jewel with IBM )n assuring their cooperationo
