OFFICE OF Dr. Bayard Rankin May 26, 1955

To: Professor Philip M. Morse
Dr. F. L. Foster

This concerns the cost estimates and charges on the March joint Quarterly
Report for DIC Project Nos. 6915 and 6345. The figures quoted below were
obtained from Mr. F. W. Fenerty of the MIT Photographic Service where the typing,
printing, and binding of the report was done.

Before the Report was begun, the following estimate was made for 400 copies
of an 80 page report:

Typing at approx. $1.25/page $3100.00
Everything but typing 330.04
Total for both projects $150.04
Total for each project $215.02

This estimate assumed no composition (type setting) costs and no costs
for inserting mathematical equations and figures, because the format was pre-
pared completely without typesetting (the cover being drawn by Illustration
Service) and the equations and figures were put in by Porter and Rankin.

The final charges for 420 copies of an 84 page report are as follows:

Typing, 65 1/2 hours at $5.00/hour 53517.50
Everything but typing including 25% overhead

(See Itemized List below) 566.30

Total for both projects 3368530

Total for each project $341.90

(180 copies additional for 11.0) ($3496.93)

It is clear that the estimates and charges are fair for everything except
typing. It is also clear that the 335.00/hour for typing was not intimated in
the estimate and is completely outside the range of technical typist‘s salaries.
(According to Isiiss Head of the MIT Personnel Office, an experienced technical
typist receives up to $1.50/hour.) The typing for the report was done on a
standard IBM machine and could have been done by any typist unfamiliar with
mathematical work.

The only explanation that is available (from Mr. Fenerty) on the €25.00/hour
rate is that it is a standard charge by Photo Service, though the typist herself
is paid only somewhat better than the €Fl.50/hour rate. It is implied that the
difference $5.50/hour is incorporated into some sort of overhead. It should be

noticed that any overhead of this sort is over and above the 25‘}; already included
in the major item.
