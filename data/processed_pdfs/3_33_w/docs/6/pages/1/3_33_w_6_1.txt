‘Though we know we should defeat you,

4-\ . PULLING OUT THE RUG

The kind of thing that makes loyal sup-
porters of President Eisenhower's foreign
‘policy lose confidence in his administration’s
willingness to fight for what it believes in has
Just been illustrated by what happened in
the Senate in the debate on proposed liberali-

. zation of the Battle Act.

This law, passed in 1951 during the Korean

~ war, prohibits giving aid to any Communist-

dominated country except under extremely
‘Although even this

block help to Yugoslavia and Poland, the
Battle Act does make it difficult to include
such countries in the foreign-ald program,
and in fact clearly establishes congressional

~ policy against attempting to crack the Iron

Curtain in this manner.

The State Department has long favored a
more flexible and imaginative approach to
foreign” aid, recognizing that anything we
can do to weaken the dependence of Com-

. munist-dominated countries on the Soviet
- Union is to our own advantage.

With the
Department’s ‘encouragement, the Senate
Foreign Relat\i,ons Committee therefore wrote
into this year’s mutual-security bill an
amendment to the Battle Act which would

- place American aid to Communist-controlled

countries on a positive instead of a negative
basis. It would permit the President to give
assistance to any country (except the Soviet
Union, Communist China, and North Korea)
if he thinks it would help it become more
democratic and more independent of Sino-
Soviet domination,

It is evident that the administration orig-
Inally favored this sensible proposal, even to
the point of helping draft the exact wording
of the amendment. But some important
Republicans, such as Senator KNowrLAND and
Senator BRIDGES, are bitterly opposed not only
to liberalizing the Battle Act but to granting
any help to satellite countries at all. They
were apparently able to frighten the White
House and the State Department into with-
drawing their active support for this measure
on a technicality, with the result that when
the test came in the Senate the amendment
failed by one vote.

~There can' hardly be doubt that had the
administration been willing to put up a fight

OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTAT;VES

Monday, June 9, 1958

Mr. WILEY. Mr. President, on May 26
I pointed out to the Senate that a tech-
nical revolution is under way, thanks to
the increasing availability of hxgh-speed
electronic computers.

These computers ate helping to achieve
breakthroughs in civilian and military
technology the like of which could not
have even been dreamed of m the pre-
war era.

In all phases of science, in industry,
in agnculture, the computers are per=-

heretofore been impossible, or, second.
what ha’s been possible only with virtual
armies of individuals at work for years

MATHEMATICAL PROPICIEN’CY OoF ORACL!:
' AT OAK RIDGE

Today, for example, I was pleased fto
receive from Dr. A. S. Householder,
director of the mathematics panel of the
Oak Ridge National Laboratory, of Oak
Ridge, Tenn., a report on some of the
tremendous achievements of the machine
known as ORACLE. The initials stand
for Oak Ridge Automatic Computer
and Logical Engine. The mathematical
wizardry of this machine is something
which almost almost takes the breath
away. It is capable of multiplying two

‘numbers in about one two-thousandths

of a second. It can add in one twenty-
thousandths of a second.

Dr. Householder a former pres1dent
of the Association for Computing Ma->
chinery and a member at large of the

National Research Council, has been -

asked to help manage United States par-
ticipation in the first International Con-
ference on Information Processing. It
will be held June 18-21, 1959, under
sponsorship of the Umted Nations Edu-
cational, Scientific, and Cultural Organ-

SPEEDING RESEARCH FOR WORLD SCIENCE FOR
PEACE

From this and similar get-togethers
should come most helpful information on
speeding the technical revolution to
which I have referred.

As a senior member of the Senate Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations, I, person-
ally, am naturally especially interested
in what these computers can accomplish
in helping to pull together scientific data
from all over the world.

Electronic abstracting and retrieval
can make a world of difference for
hard-pressed, overburdened researchers
throughout the globe.

I cite as illustration of the present dire
need these observations by Prof. Maurice
B. Visscher of the University of Minne=
sota. They were presented at a confer-
ence on international aspects of librar-
ianship, held at the University of Chi-
cago in 1954;

mm '1‘9 SENA'I‘OR WILEY FROM T. J’ WA N’, J!t.
Electronic opportunities for acceler- <

ated medical research are pa.rtxcularly
impressive. I should like to cite now a

fine response which I have received from A
Mr. T. J. Watson, Jr., president of the

International Busmess Machines Corp
in response to an inquiry I had sent:
IN‘I’ERNATIONAL BUSINESS .
2 ' ~  MACHINES CORP.,
New York, N. Y., June 5, 1958.
The Honorable ALEXANDER WILEY,
United States Senate, Washington, D. C.

DEAR SENATOR WILEY: Thank you for your

letter of May 31 and for sending your con-

structive talk on the broad ‘application of -_:'\;
electronic data-processing systems in the

United States.
The application of electronic computers in
medical research is an area of considerable

Anterest to us and is being explored by our

research division. One possibility being in-
vestigated is how these machines might be
used in the keeping of medical histories to

the benefit of both medical research and. o

practice.

Still another area of ruture promise is in
the analysis of medica‘l'reports by electronic
computers to help the practicing physician
in diagnoses.

This use of computlng machines would
seem to be most valid, and we hope that with
well-directed research worthwhile results can
be obtained. i

- Sincerely yours, T

VARIOUS ARTICLES SHOW USES OF COMPUTERS.

I have in my hands a series of articles
from various sources showing medical
and other applications of electronic com-
puters, as reported by top researchers.

From Dr. H. P. Luhn, of the Interna-
tional Business Machines Corp., comes
word of a computer which reads and
abstracts 2,300 words of a scientific ar-
ticle in 3 minutes. r

From Dr. Vladimir K. Zworykm di-
rector of electronic research for the
Radio Corporation of America, comes the
concept of an electronic medical office,
in time to come, which will instantane-
ously compile and store medical knowl=
edge for physicians. :

From Vassar College comes welcome
word of a new course in numerical
analysis and orientation for progr aming;
that is, translating mathematical prob-
lems into machine language for elec-
tronic computers.

From the Biophysical Society, in Cam-
bridge, Mass., comes word of a computer
which 1dent1ﬁes individuals by their
brainwave patterns—a crucial aid in the
science of electroencephalography.

From the periodical, Computers and
Automation, comes an estimate that a
hundred thousand men and women will
be ministering to computers within 10
years.

From the Minneapolis-Honeywell
Corp. comes word of a new machine
which can read 8,000 words a second
against errors.
