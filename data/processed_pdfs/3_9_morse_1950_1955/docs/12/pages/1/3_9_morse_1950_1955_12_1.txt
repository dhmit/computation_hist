Dear Professor lMorse!

In accordance with our recent discussions concerning the computational
requirements of the Institute, I have prepared a brief memorandum on this
subject which I am enclosing for your consideration. The format is arranged
in such & way (I hope) that you mey make eny additionel recommendations.
These may be typed on Page 4 and additional copies run off on hecte.

I have just received a telephone c¢all from Dr. Hurde He will arrive at
the Institute on Wednesday, December 15, at 9 a.me (he could not make it on
the 13th), You will recall that we intended to have & group meeting attended
by Professors Stratton, Floe, lorse, Dr. Hurd, and myself sometime during the
morning of the 15the Perhaps we should schedule a meeting of M.I.T. personnel
(Stratton, Floe, lMorse, Verzuh) sometime on Monday, at which time we sould
acquaint the administration with our thoughts on this matter prior to meeting
with Dr. Hurd on Wednesday.

J

December 8 « 10. I expect to see & number of the new computers which are %o
be exhitited at that time -« IBM 660, and the consolidated Megnetie Drum Calculetor.
