put out a combined progress report. In some published papers,
credit could be given to one organization alone; in others, credit
would go to both. Bookkeeping would be somewhat more complicated,
but since most of the expense would be for salaries, little for
permanent equipment, thls could be done. It probably would be
necessary to have the usual government overhead for both contracts.

The proposed budget asked of each agency for 1956-57 1s
given below. The corresponding amounts for the following two years
would be gis5,000 for 1957-58 and $50,000 for 1958-59, as indicated
above.

Propo3ed Research; Possible Initial Directions'gg Investigation:

1. Investigation of Structure and Syntax of input
languages; the possibilitles of coding directly in mathematical,
logical or business language.

2. Development of routines capable of translating from
algebraic notation to computer code and vice versa, including
possibly automatic selectilon of numerical techniques and automatlc
error analysis, 3

3, Development of numerical analytic techniques particu-
larly suitable for use by digltal computers; such as more general
expansions, truncated Chebyshev polynomials sums for simulating
standard functions by & common block of instructions but small
separate blocks of coefficlents and cycle counters and methods of
automatic determination of best grid sSpacing, by trial plus
Richardson extrapolation or other means,

. Investigation of Monte Carlo technigues for large
problems.

5. Extension and/or improvement of present techniques
for communication between machine and operator and for the more
flexible control of machine operation, including possible improve-
ments in input-output equipment.
