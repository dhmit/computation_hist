Dear Dr. Rarremans

By the terms of our agreement with I.B.M., the
equipment in the new Computation Center is to be used by the
cooperating universities in New England and no outside work
will be attempted. This rule 1s imposed for several reasons:
The cooperating universities and colleges wlll undoubtedly
use the full time of the machine within a short time; also,
if an exception were made and some other institutlon were
glven access to the machine, 1Â¢ would be impossible to draw
the line and we shortly would be flooded with requests which
we could not possibly satisfy.

Consequantly, though it is with considerable regret,
I must tell you that There seems to be no way whereby your
Institute can be given direct access to the machine. If there
were some faculty member of one of the cooperating colleges
who was actively enough involved in this program you mention
to be able to say that 1t was a part of his work and of
importance in training his students, then it night be possible
for your problem to get to the machine in this indirect way.

I have talked this matter over with Professor Schmitt
of our Blology Department and I believe he understands our
point. Perhaps a discussion with either Professor Schmitt or
with Professor Slater in the Physics Department would uncover

a possible modus operandi.

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse
