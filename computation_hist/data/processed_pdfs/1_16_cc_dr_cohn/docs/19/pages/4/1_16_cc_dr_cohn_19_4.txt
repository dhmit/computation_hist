The Poincaré theta functions, having f,he period 1, can always b
expanded into a Laurent series in exp 2miz valid for Jz positive and larg.
In some cases the series is finite in one direction so that

f(2) = (exp—2nirz) (Ko + k1 exp 2mwiz + - - -),

where ¥’y 0 and 7 is an integer. (This occurs, for instance, when f(z) is
bounded as Jz— .) Then we say f(z) is of degree . Thus if f(z) has
no poles the function P(w) introduced in equation (4) is a polynomia¥ of
degree r 4 m.,, where m, is given in the above table. For other function-
theoretical aspects of theta functions, too numerous to recall here, we refer

to Poincaré’s papers. We are principally interested in the tables jus
presented.

where m = 2 and the first and second Sums are over g integer sets that
satisfy the conditions stated under the Summation. In ejther case it ?s
apparent that we are dealing with g theta function jf We can assume absolute
convergence, since a rearrangement of terms shows that (1) is satisfied by
Fzm(z) and @2m(z)-

In a region &, bounded away from the p

by well known estimates.

If, in the series for ®,,(z) as given in equation (5), we sum first over

where the asterisk means that ¢ and » rup independently over complete sets
of residues modulo ¢. We now assume once and for all that 30 = 0 thus
we avoid poles. The series (5) with appropriate grouping of terms, or series
(5a), converges absolutely and uniformly in the region mentioned above.

If we differentiate the series (5) term by term we obtain a series in
which the convergence is now absolute and uniform, without grouping of
terms, in the region ®. Thus we define

Since Gon(z, z) 1s precisely G.n(z), we see how to obtain the latter theta
series from Oy (2).

9. Non-vanishing of theta functions. We are now faced with the by
10 means tfrivial problem of deciding if our theta series vanish identically.
Without such g decision, the problem of asymptotic behavior may be
meaningless, .

The case of F.,(2) is easily disposed of. If z approaches infinity along
the imaginary axis, by the uniformity of convergence of its serie.s, Fon(2)
must approach the part of its sum consisting of constant terms,. which makes
