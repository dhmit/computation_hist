Program

We would emphasize that this is not a course in coding for machines -
problems will have to be run on the NBS machines but the audience need only
become expert on their own machines. It will be given by mathematicians
for mathematicians.

The training program would be in three parts:

a) 2 weeks:

Introduction to numerical analysis and to programming for automatic

computers.

During this phase participants would prepare small sample problems
and run them on the Bureau's high speed computer in order to get some idea
of problems involved.

The basis of the formal teaching here would be the discussion of a
complex of problems which illustrate various topics in numerical apalysis
and programming for automatic computers; the program could be readily
adapted for computers different from that at the Bureau.

b) 13 weeks:

Survey of various chapters in numerical analysis and observaticn
of operation of a general purpose computation laboratory.
During b) each participant would do a computation problem, preferably
in his own field, on the machine. Expert coding assistance would be
given to each participant so that he should not be unnecessarily in-
volved in the Bureau's machine. At the same time participants could observe

in detail the complete handling of major problems.
