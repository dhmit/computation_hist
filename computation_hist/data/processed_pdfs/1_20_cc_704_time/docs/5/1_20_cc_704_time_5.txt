INTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM

To: Professor Philip Mo Morse

From: Dr. Arthur L. Loeb

SUBJECT: Electophoresis Problem on the IBM-70h Computer

Last summer we discussed the possibility of running a
problem in electrophoresis of colloid particles on the IBM-70h computer.
I started on a machine analysis of this problem during my leave of absence

from M.I.T., spent at the University of Utrecht, in the Netherlands.

When we last talked about this, I proposed bringing my assistant at Utrecht,

P. Wiersta, to MIT for a year to continue on the problem, and you suggested

that if we find the facilities for inviting this man, computer time would

be available. At t‘is point, we are considering inviting Wier§ma as a

guest of our computer research group for the year 1957-58, but before
extending the invitation I should like to have a confirmation from you

regarding the availability of the computer next year.
