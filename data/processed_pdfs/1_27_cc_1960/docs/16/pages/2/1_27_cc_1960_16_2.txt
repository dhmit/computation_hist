.o each user of a remote console, the TO90 system would appear to
be a slower running machine, but he would have available to h;m any
of the powerful programming and diagnostic systems now in use, as
well as a large central flling system for his own programs and dises.
Problems of program safety¥* and accounting can be presently solved
with known techniques.

3. Problems to be Studied and Solved:
1. Hardware - As has been previously stated, not enough is pre-
sently known about the 7090 design to glve definite specifications
for what is needed. However, there are several "Must" items that
can best be provided through IBM that can (by their lack) invali-
date this as a feasable system. The lack of these items 1s not
too probable if IBM cooperation is achieved at a high level on the
basis of the novelty, and general applicablility of the system.
A) Disc files - A must item. Our prior specs for a T090 system
do not include discs since IBM has not announced them for the
T090. They have, however, equipped a sister machine, the T070,
with low speed d:8e¢8. These will be invaluable in providing
random access to programs and programming systems to all con-
current users.
B) Remote Inquiry Stations - Another must item. Such inquiry
stations should be wire connected to the 7090 in order to mini-
mize both cost and maintenance. Although flezowriters could be
used, we would be far better off in using the remote inquiry
stations that IBM uses with the 7070 system, or possibly with
their 305 system.
C) Guard or Boundary Registers - A definite highly desirable
itent®* In time shared usage, the problem of program compata-
bility becomes of paramount interest. Lacking such registers,
the solutions to compatibillity will either limit the overall
speed of the system ( as in our flexo monitor - interpretive
system where speed drops by some 40 ) or else the flexibility
of the system by restricting the programmer to completely safe,
and foolproof program systems. IBM has developed such registers
for their "stretch" system, but 1t would be highly unlikely that
