The set le,..xUn of n-tuplets (xl,:..,xn) is

called the domain of £,
the range of\f, :
Forms and Functions, In order to make
propcerly the definitions that follow, we will
dis%inﬁuish between functions and expressions
Following Church™ the

and the set V ie\called

 

1nvolv1n<r variables,
,flattez are called forms.,
: £f,g,h, etc, or sequences. of letters such as sin
s are used to denote funcélons _
as f(x y) f(g(x),y) x +y are called forms, In
partlcular we may refer to the function £
~defined by f(x,y)=x +y. Our definitions will be
written as though all forms involving functions
were written f(,.,..,) although we will use
expressions like x+y with infixes like % in
examples,

Composition, Now we shall describe the ways

in which new functions are defined from old,

The first way may be called (generalized) com-
position and involves the use of forms, We e shall
use the letters x,y,... (sometimes with sub-
scripts) for variables and will suppose that
there is a notation for constants that does not
'make'expressions ambiguous, (Thus, the decimal
notation is allowed for constants when we are
dealing with integers,)

Tihe class of forms is defined recursively
as follows:

i) A variable x with an associatcd space U
is a form,
A constant in a space U is a form and we also
associate U with this form,

T Cl""’en are forms associated with
the spaces Ul)...,v_ respectively, then
f(e er)—is o form associated with the space
Il

V., In th way the form (£(g(x,y),x) is

Single letters such as

and with this form we also associate U.’

a composition are total functions, the new func-
tion is also a“total function, but the ‘other
processes for defining functlons are not so kind
to totality, When the work "function" is used
from here on, we shell mean partial funcfion

- Having to introduce partial functions\ls a
~nuisance, but an unavoi able one, The rules for
defining computable functions sometimes give
computation processes that never terminate, and
when the computation process fails to terminate
the result is undefined, It has been shown that
there is no effective general way of deciding
whether a process will terminate,

Predicates and Propositional Forms
The space 77 of truth values whose only

elements are T (for truth) and F (for falsity)
has a special role in our theory, A function
whose range is 77 is called a predicate, Ex-

amples of predicates on the integers are prime
defined by

 

 

T if x is prime
prime(x)
xF otherwise
and less defined by

(Tif-x<y
less(x,y) i
F otherwise
We shall, of course, write x<y instead of

less(x,y), For any space U there is a predi-
cate eqU of two arguments defined by
!T if x=y
eq, (x,y) =
(F otherwise
We shall write x=y instead of
