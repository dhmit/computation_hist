Dr. John T. Fey, President
University of Vermont
Burlington, Vermont

Dear Dr. Fey:

1 am pleased to enclose a check for $1, 450. 00 for the second
semester portion of the University of Vermont appointments to the M.I. T.
Computation Center as described on the attached sheet. The IBM
Corporation is very grateful for the work of the Research Associates
and Assistants in the program for they have contributed a great deal to
its success.

There are now thirty-four colleges and universities in New
England participating with M.I1.T. in the Computation Center. The new
IBM 709 has been in operation for four months, and already seventeen of
the colleges have made use of it. For your information, I am enclosing
a table of usage for the months September - December, 1960.

1 am delighted that the University of Vermont is developing
such an interest in the computing field, and I know that you are all
looking forward to the very imminent installation of your IBM 1620.

Miss Virginia Low has been very active at M.1. T. during the past
semester, and I am sure she will be a most valuable person on your staff
there in Burlington this coming semester.

With warmest personal regards.

Sincerely yours,

M. Lioren Bullock
University Representative
