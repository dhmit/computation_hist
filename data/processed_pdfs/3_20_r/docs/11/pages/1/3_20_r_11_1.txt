Dear M. Kateoka:

Under separvate cover I have sent you a copy of the GQS progzam for the
709 (or T090), together with an assembly listing. If you would like the
symboliec progism cards, please let me know.

The T09 version operates essentlially the same as the TOk version. I have
made only the changes which were necessary to have the old program operate
on the new machine. The new program has been designed to operate within the
standurd T09 FORTRAN Monitor system which is, I believe, in operation there
at M.I.T. Specifically, you should note the following points sbout the

T09 version:

1. The input tape is A2;
The output tspe is AS3:
Tape AL iz used during execution of the program:
o senze switches are used.

2. 'The progrvam loads into location 400 (decimsl) and
above. (An absolute loader is loaded by the
FGRE?ANZMonitor; the gbsolute loader then loads
GQs.

3. The on~line cloeck is not used; therefore the REALT
(real time) LENGTH option is no longer allowed.

L, The PUNCH card is no longer used and the non-
statlionary-input procedure has been changed. To
use the non-stationaiy feature, the following steps
are necessary:

a) make an initial run to dete√©rmine parameter
locations;
