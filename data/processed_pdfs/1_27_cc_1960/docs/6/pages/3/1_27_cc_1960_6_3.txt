which enables the 704 to be used on languaze translation problems;
and LISP, which enables the machine to handle non-e%l
logic, such as algebralic and othexr symbolic manipulation, are

being developed and tested, The work at LIT in ¥his field, since
wnirlwind days, is well known,

Time-sharing Technigues: vie already have a typewriter connected
to the 704, which works on a time-sharing basis wi.th our regular
operator routine, so new programs can be debugzed ot the same vime
that regular computations are being carried out on other problens,
for example. lhe 704 cannot effectively accomodate more than one
or two such sa telite chcnnels, but the Center stafl is now at work
on the design and programning required to provide a 7090 with #4 10
to 4.0 such "substation consoles" of various effective speeds and
capacities, which can be placed at appropriate places pround LIT,
