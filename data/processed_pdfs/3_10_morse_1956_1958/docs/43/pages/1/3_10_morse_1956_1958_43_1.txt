bear Sheldon:

At the last meeting of the 704 "steering committee’ it was
decided to extend your leave of absence until July 1. Please
return before that if you Possibly can., If your current project
should extend beyond that date, reusgotiation will certainly
be possible, but currently your leave of absence will expire
on July 1.

 

We certainly need an expert on the 704 beginning vight now to
help us learn the code, but you should certainly try to complete
the Fortran job before returning.

 

Peg and I would like to extend am unofficial invitation to
come again while skiing is still good.

Hope to hear from you soonm.

Good luck,

Dean N. Arden
