Professor Cecil J. Schneer
University of New Hampshire
Durham, New Hampshire

Dear Professor Schneer:

We find your proposed problem in Geology an interesting
one and one which should be possible to explore fruitfully by
machine methods. There have been, of course, a number of studies
in this general field and any active work on your part should
build on the knowledge already gained.

As a member of the faculty of the University of New
Hampshire, it will be possible for you to obtain time on the
machine here at the Center and we will be glad to talk over with
you some of the problems involved in getting started, in particular,
we can get you in touch with people who have been working on
similar problems. I suggest you get in touch with Professor Owens
who is the institutional representative from the University of
NewwHampshire concerning the details of getting computation done
at the Center. We will be glad to hear from you or Professor Owens
when you can come down to talk to us about your problem.

Sincerely yours,

Philip M, Morse
