Dear Professor Morse:

In connection with the installation of the type 704 computer which
has far greater computing capacity than the type 650 computer, we plan to
terminate our program of supporting 60 percent of the rental of the 650
now installed at MIT. Of course, we do not want to interrupt programs
already planned for the machine during the Spring semester so this will
take effect on June 30, 1957.

During the brief period of overlap of these two programs, we be-
lieve it is very important to keep accurate records of the use of the support-
ing card machines to the 704 operation so that when the 650 goes out, we
will know what equipment is needed to support the 704 installation,

Sincerely yours,

‚Äù
