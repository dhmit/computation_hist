By means of comparative studies between three-
dimensional and two dimensional (J. I’hysiol.
116: 151’, 1952) electrolytic tank models of the
human thorax, it has been shown that if the verti-
cal angle a lies within the range :30“, the distri-
bution of potential around the boundary of the
ﬂat (‘two dimensional’) tank is very similar to the
distribution of potential around the deep (‘three
dimensional’) tank at the level of the dipole
center. Measurements in two—dimensional models
can, therefore, provide information about the
horizontal component of the heart-vector. In
addition to model experiments, circumferential
chest leads were taken at mid~ventricular level
of several normal and abnormal subjects using a
plastic belt holding 23 electrodes. The vertical
angle a was computed from bipolar limb leads.
For those cases in which a lay in the range i30°
with the horizontal plane, the potential distribu-
tion around the chest was plotted for various
instants of time It was found that for the human
subjects the horizontal component corresponded
to a single dipole at some times; at other times,
two or more effective dipoles were evident, By
comparing these measurements with results on the
model, it was possible to determine the horizontal
angle. The method provides a check on calcula
tions of this vector quantity derived from con-
ventional surface electrocardiograms. (Supported
