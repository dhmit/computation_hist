With the aid of equation (8) the conductivity of a material
with controlled porosity can be calculated. When the ar-
rangement of the pores is anisotropic because either their
separation is larger in one direction than in another or because
the pores themselves are not spherical, then rotating the sam-
ple with respect to the direction of the temperature gradient
causes a change in conductivity of the sample. The con-
ductivity is no longer a scalar, but rather a tensor, and when
tl}e sa?nple is placed with a symmetry axis at an angle to the
d?rectlon of the temperature gradient, the heat flow will be
directed at an angle to the temperature gradient.

Thermal Conductivity: IX, Experimental Investigation
of Effect of Porosity on Thermal Conductivity

by J. FRANCL and W. D. KINGERY

The effect of isometric approximately spherical
pores and anisometric cylindrical pores on the
thermal conductivity of alumina, graphite, a.nd
nickel has been investigated. Pore orientation
is found to affect profoundly the thermal conduc-
tivity for a given porosity. At temperatures be-
low about 500°C. the conductivity of @ POrotS
sample in any given direction is equal to the §Olld
conductivity times one minus the cross—sect'lonal
pore fraction or k, = k. (1 — Po). At higher
temperatures the pore size and emissivity become
important.
