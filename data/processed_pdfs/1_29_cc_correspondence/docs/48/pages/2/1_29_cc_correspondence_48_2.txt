gimultaneous eumations are solved &s follows:

a. An approximste inverse (M) of the coefficient metrix (A) is ob-
teined by en elimination method pirated from NYDMEIL.

b. An initial estimete of theisolution vector is taken as Mb, where
b ies the right-hand side.

¢, An "itersting matrix" I-MA is formed and the solution is improved by
the formula Xye, = (I-MA)x, + MD until no decreese in
the length of the error vector Ax-b is obtained. The routine also ‘
checks that the asbove method will converge by forming I-AM and checking
that the sum of the magnitudes of the elements in eny row is less than
one, |

d. The approximete inverse, and a set of estimates of the meximum error
in each row of the coefficient metrix, the latter supplied by the
user, are-used to compute & bound on the meximum error in each element
of the solution vector.

e. Solution of many sets of equations with the same coefficient matrix
is expedited by the subroutine DNEXT (see Appendix III) which takes
adventege of the fact thet A, M, I-MA, and the "workspace" (see below)

ere saved on MT-NINE.

4pa. 8, Assuming the approximate inverse is good eno#gh to assure convergence
of the iterstive method, this routine should supply the best results
obteinabtle with double-precision arithmetic.
b. The routine cen hendle any matrix up to 80 X 80, depending on the
size of core memory available,

c. Oonvergence of step ¢ in 4 gbove is assured because we have
