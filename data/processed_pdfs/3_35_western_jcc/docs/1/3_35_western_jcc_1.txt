I am enthusiastic about the subject content of the session. But I am even
more enthusiastic about its format. If this session is successful, I intend to

urge program chairmen of other technical meetings to organize similar sessions of
integrated content.

I hope that you will have an opportunity to attend this session and partici-
pate in the discussion periods.
Sincerely yours,
