T DoUBLE LAYER EvrecrrOLYTIC TANK

ayer electrolytic tank recently de-
veloped by Boothroyd et al.? has two advantages
e conventional type in the technic of field
first, the boundary error is eliminated and
the measurements are equivalent to those made in
an infinite two-dimensional medium; and secondly,
it is possible to obtain a theoretically perfect “In-
different” electrode. In this tank, the electrolyte is
divided into two layers by a 1715 inch diameter
plateglass disk mounted on four small spacers. As
the diameter of the tank itself is 18 inches, there is a
14 inch gap around the edge of the plate. The top
liquid layer is thus contiguous with the lower layer
around the periphery, and the two layers are elec-
trically “matched”. Mathematically® the top layer

platinum ungrounded olectrode substituted as th.e
reference point. That the bottom layer electrode 1
at zero potential was proved by a simple experiment,
shown in figcure 1. Two dipoles were placed at ran-
dom locations, A and B, in the double-layer tank.
The point P is then a theoretical zer()-pﬂtelltial
point, since it lies at the intersection of the trans-
verse axes of the two dipoles. When potentials Were
measured with respect to the bottom-layer olectrode,
P was found to have zero potential. _
The double-Jayer tank is very useful for measuring
the field due to any distribution of sources and sinks,
as it is not necessary to correct for the finite l)()lll}(l‘
ary. In addition, the locus of the zm-n-w»tential line
due to the distribution can be determined.

The potential of a dipole in an infinite two-
dimensional medium: This problem was prob-
ably first worked out by Kirchoff in 1845,* and
a complete treatment was given by Foster and
Lodge in 1875.° With reference to electro-
cardiography, Wilson presented calculations of
potentials of a dipole in an infinite medium and
