How can something as complex as a company’s
personality be evaluated scientifically?

A company image study necessarily deals on a
very high level of abstraction. For this reason a
company’s personality image has always been
difficult to assess—so much so that until very
recently it was considered impossible to evaluate
the image of a company in anything approach-
ing a precise and systematic manner.

People responsible for a company’s reputation
have always realized that the personality of a
company, like the personality of a human being,
is made up of many different dimensions, or
“traits”. The problem has always been to find
out what these personality traits are, and then
isolate them so that they can be studied one by
one.

Who has an “image” of a company’s personality?

Every company deals with a number of different
“publics”, or groups of people, whose good Wi

is of importance to the company. Each of these
various publics is likely to have a somewhat differ-
ent image of the company. Some of the publics
whose good will is most often of importance ar.

a) The Consumers
b) The Trade
c) The Local Community
d) The Personnel
e) The Investing Public
These five groups of people are, in the final

analysis, the ones who decide how successful a
company will become.

This direct relationship between image and suc-
cess has received a great deal of attention in
recent years. Many companies are seriously at-
tempting to define their public image in terms of
its sales value. They realize that in order to perfect
their company image (perfection being measured
by long-term sales value) they must first find out
precisely how the public now looks upon their
Company. In Ils difficult area of corporate self-
analysis, specialists in company im

certain number of distinct synonym groups. The
most representative word of each group was then
chosen and tested experimentally. This study re-
sulted in the “trait” words which best represent
each of the basic “traits” or dimensions of a

company’s reputation.

How the Company Image Profile evaluates a
company’s personality on each of its basic traits

Each trait word, along with a definition of how

the word applies to a company, is put on a Rem-

ington-Rand tab card. The cards are then brought

to a carefully selected cross-section of the public

by specially trained interviewers. They ask each
. person to sort the deck according to how well
| the cards describe their opinion of the company.
The same people also sort the cards according
to how well they describe a major competitor.
This provides a benchmark so that the client will
be able to evaluate the relative merit of his own
company’s score on each trait.

How comparison with the “ideal image” gives
positive direction to your image building efforts

Using the same trait cards, the people are asked,
“if you were going to buy a (refrigerator), which
of these cards describe the kind of company you
would like to buy from?” This gives the company

the “ideal image.” Thus, the Company Image
Profile provides three valuable comparative scores
for each personality trait: the score for the client
company, the score for a competitor, and the
score for the ideal company in his line of business.

How Univac pin-points who said what about
the company

A comparison of these three company images
(the client company, a competitor, and the ideal
company) shows by sharp contrast which are the
strong points and which are the weak points of
the company’s personality. The traits are then
carefully analyzed with the help of Univac to
find out what type of people (age, sex, socio-
economic group, location, etc.) have a favorable
or unfavorable opinion of the company on each
of the personality traits.

The client company then knows, (a) exactly
what personality traits it is weak in, (b) how
serious this weakness is, and (c) the kind of
people who have a favorable or adverse opinion
of each trait in the company image.


How the results are put to work

When a company knows the strong and weak
traits of its personality, it is ready to decide which
traits to emphasize in its communications with

the public.

As a typical example of how helpful the results
can be, let us say that the Profile turns up a
low score in the “progressive” area—that people
think of the company as decidedly “old fashioned”
and “homespun.” This finding is checked against
the “progressive” score of a competitor, and
against the score for the ideal company in this
line of business. It is also checked against the
kind of company image that the president says
he would like people to have of his company.

If the company lags badly in all of these com-
parisons, corrective action is decided upon. Every-
one in the company is told that the company
wants to accentuate “progress” in all of its actions
and communications. Advertising and public re-
lations people in particular are told to emphasize
progress in every possible way.

   

 

For a company to change its actual personality or
to change its image in the public’s mind is, of
course, a very difficult task. But when all of the
people working for the company know exactly
which traits to emphasize, the image building
job can be accomplished sooner, more economi-
cally, and more effectively than ever before.

How much of an investment is necessary to
evaluate a company’s image?

One of the major advantages of the Company
Image Profile is the comparatively small invest-
ment needed to obtain the large number of per-
sonal judgments upon which the evaluation is
based. The comparatively low prices are due to
the fact that we specialize in company image
evaluations and, therefore, have systematized the
procedure for obtaining and reporting the large
number of individual judgments involved.

SUMMARY OF ADVANTAGES

The Company Image Profile is Comprehensive

For' the first time a company can be sure that
all of the traits of its company image are being
evaluated, not just the obvious ones.

The Profile is Flexible

It can be used for any group of people in whom
you are interested—consumers, chain store buy-
ers, tradepaper writers, union members—no mat-
ter who or where the group is, we can obtain a
Profile of their image of your company.

It is Objective

No one influences the results except the people
who are being interviewed. There is no danger of
personal bias entering into the statement of sur-
vey results.

It is Precise

A definite score is obtained for each of the per-
sonality traits. Hard facts replace the broad esti-
mates and general statements of the past.

It Gives Definite Direction to Your Planning

Comparisons between your company image, a
competitor’s company image, and the ideal image
provide concrete direction to your image build-
ing efforts.

It Can be Repeated Later to Measure Change

Changes in company image can be tested in later

years by repeating the same test among the same
type of people.

It is Reasonably Priced

The systematized procedure of the Company
Image Profile permits the accumulation of this

large amount of information at comparatively low
cost.

Case History of a Typical Company Image Profile
will be Shown on Request

The best way to demonstrate just how the Profile
actually gives positive direction to your company’s
communications with the public is to see what the
service has discovered about the images of two
typical competitive companies. We will be glad
to show you the results of this sample evaluation
at any time convenient for you.
