Dear Professor Morse:

Many thanlm for your letter of July 12. I will

I hope that you will not make a. special trip to
New York on my account. If, however, you should be coming
here for some other purpose -- either during the week of
August 6 or later in September -- I would be very pleased
to see you. w secretary, Miss Harris, will be glad to
fix an appointment if you will get in touch with her when
your plans are settled.

Sincerely yours,
