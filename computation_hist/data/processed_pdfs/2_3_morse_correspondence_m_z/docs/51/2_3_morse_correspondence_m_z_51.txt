Dear Dr. Curtiss

We have had Special Summer Programs on high-
speed computer programming and techniques In previous
summers. This summer all we will be putting on wlll be
a special course for our students and for those of other
New England colleges giving the detalls of how to
program problems for the I.B.M. TO4.

We are not attempting anything further for this
summer because our new equipment is being installed, but
we certainly intend to put on one or more of the Speclal
Summer Programs you mention in the summer of 1958. If
you are still interested at that time we would be glad
to send you announcements.

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse
Director
