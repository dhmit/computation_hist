it is difficult to extrapolate how much "chargeable" use of Whirlwind
hes been made since November, 1954. Available records regarding machine and
personnel time transfers for this period indicate that 548l774.65 have been
carned during the period November through Jume 30, 1955. This figure: does
not include the large amount of work which was done on & free (non-chargeable)
