Ls _ In the first place, we asked IBM to start delivery ho
of some of the peripheral equipment. ahead of time, because = |
we wanted to use it to get routines and cards worked up

before the 704 got here. (We talked this over with you last
spring and sald then we would need two bays-eor at the pinch,
one bay--next to Frank's place in Building 20, to set up the
machines, to work with the rest of Frank's people and |
machines +) | |

Ss Well, the machines are here and) more are ‘coming
next Weeki And there was hardly space to get them out of
the rain! If IBM asks whether we are now using them after

they bust a gut getting them here, we'll have to say no.

one is given to the Technlque for a monthl, two to AFROTC

and part of the one beyond, as far as ‘anyone can see, is a
coffee room for the janitors! And we can't even get the
one bay after Technique 1s through with it! What do I say
0 IBM?

On the other point, the air conditioning. I want
to let you know that I am no longer worrying about its A
additional cost since I got the figures. We can prove, in
the case of the air conditioning, that 1/3 of its cost
(50,000 out of the total 160,000) is caused by architect's
requirements which we didn't care about in the first place.
In addition, for the 160,000 we are not getting the con-.
ditioning we need to use the machines for education (noise,
again) so we are going to have to demand more pressure, even
if it costs more money--otherwise We can't use the TO% for
classes. The need for the additional pressure comes entirely

from the long ducts, which come from the architect's demands
again. If the architects can demand 50,000 extra just for |
prettiness, I feel we can demand 20,000 extra just to make |
the equipment useful! R Tag Ce ;
| Is the terrifically high cost of the whole addi- nd
tional three bays mostly due to the architect's fancy ideas?
If the air conditioning is any sample, I guess it is! ES
