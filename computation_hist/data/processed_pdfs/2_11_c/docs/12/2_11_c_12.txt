Computation Center: =. Goo

© As the work on our 704 expands, we find it necessary to

©" problems. This means that we are having to expand the programming

staff of the Computation Center here, and it occurs to me that =

you may know of Some younger person who would be interested in
«such a position. We are not looking for someone who necessarily

has had a large experience in programming but are looking for SE
someone who has had a good background in mathematics (a bachelor's
or master's degree) and who is interested in computing machine =~
applications. The person who comes would have a chance to take

a course or so and could go to various seminars around the place.

If, for example, he wanted to eventually get a doctor's degree,

We have a wide range of problems from those of language

We do not code the usual problem which comes to us, so these
persons would be engaged mainly in the special and interesting
problems and im writing out programs rather than detailed
coding (although there may be exceptions). Bi ate

1 would appreciate it if you could let me mow of any
person who might be interested in taking such a position either
this spring or next summer, or in suggesting that such people
should write me directly. The salary we would offer would be
normal te universities, no as high as industrial positions, but
the man would have the opportunity of further class work and would
have contact with a wider variety of problems than in industry.

 

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse
Director
