PERSONNEL

The proposed personnel for the project consists of
seven members of the Dartmouth College Mathematics Department.
The principal investigator would be John G. Kemeny, Professor
of Mathematics and Chairman of the Mathematics Department. In
addition there would be G. L. Thompson, J. McCarthy, and R. Z.
Norman, Assistant Professors of Mathematics, and R. E. William-
son, T E. Kurtz, and J. B. Fraleigh, Instructors of Mathematics.
Biographies and bibliographies are appended.

TIMING

It is proposed that the project should start on Feb-
ruary 1, 1958, and run through June 30, 1959. This would in-
clude three academic semesters and one summer,

The principal investigator and five of the staff mem-
bers would expect to devote somewhere between 1/ and 1/3 of
their time to this project. This figure is an average over the
year and a half of the duration of the project. It 1s expected
that Professor McCarthy's contribution will have to be more

limited, due to other commitments of a related nature.

COST

The exact cost of the project is somewhat hard to es-
timate, due to the fact that salary increases are to go into
effect this coming year at Dartmouth College. The size and ex-
tent of these increases has not as yet been announced. However,
a fairly careful estimate would indicate that the actual cost of
the project (including both direct and indirect expenses) would
be in the neighborhood of $30,000.
