Dear Sir:

This letter comes to you by way of a request. Shell Oil Company
Technical Services Division has asked me to carry on certain special
studies in data processing and information retrieval for its Data
Processing Research section while registered at the Harvard Easiness
School. In this connection Mr. R.S. Barton of Shell has asked me to
exchange with you, if possible, some ideas on automatic programming.

rI'he field of automatic programming is of some interest to our
group and we have studied several phases of it, including a develop—
ment of the Internal Translator ki‘l‘) oevised by A. J. Perliss, our
own design for a. data processing compiler for information retrieval,
and some Work on general concepts of information retrieval. As a
result of this work the shell group has published several papers
and manuals, some of which l have for your reference.

in this field. However, my attendance at the Business School necessarily
restricts by day somewhat. So if you approve 01' this suggestion,

may I ask that you write me to that effect and let me telephone you

to arrange the meeting?

1th you Ior your courteous attemtion to this matter.

Yours truly,

mate; 96'
