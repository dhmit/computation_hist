To: Research Project Heads

A group has recently been set up to study the present and future role of
Computation in MIT's research and education programs, as announced in
Prof, Floe's letter of July 1, 1960,

The major emphasis of this group thus far has been to determine the
adequacy of MIT's present computer facilities to meet the likely computational
load over the coming years and to recommend some policy with respect to future
facilities, As might be expected, the study to date has shown that computers
are playing an increasing role with respect to a large number of research pro-
jects as well as course and thesis work, and in fact; most all of MIT's com-
puters are being used to capacity.

The available computer time is now at such a premium that many research
groups, particularly those with problems requiring large amounts of running
time, are unable to make use of machines, We have no way of estimating the type
or extent of this hidden load, except through you,

The field of computation itself is rapidly changing, and such operations
as formal mathematical manipulation, real-time human-computer interaction with
problem oriented languages and direct access input-output devices are opening
up a wide field of possible computer application, We would like to develop some
feel for the extent of such future application in your area,

It is in the light of this information that we are asking you, as a
research project head to evaluate the role of computation in your projects
and to assist us by passing this information on to our group, Our major in-
terest is in significant research problems that you are not presently putting on
machines, due either to a lack of money, machine time, or machine capability,

We would therefore greatly appreciate your filling out the enclosed
questionnaire; and would be happy to follow up with more detailed discussions
with you or any one designated by you, If your present research does not
utilize computation, or is not likely to do so, then no reply is necessary,
