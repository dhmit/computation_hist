Computer scieace is 2 discipline in its owa right; research in this Held should

be jadged on its owna terms and student work should be recognised by advanced degrees.

MNeverthelsss, there was no concensas a8 io whether 2 computation cemter should, now |
or eventually, develop into a2 separate department. One aniversity will sooa have such
a departmant, in some others it is 2 part af & department of Applied Mithematics. Some
directors believe that the subject will eventually develop so & depariment status would l
become appropriate. However, maay others felt that the contact of the compuler was
with 80 mmyintellecml&.dphn“mztho center should continue to be inter-departi-
mental, so that students could be drawn from, aand faculty appointments could be made
jointly with, several departments.

Details of these recommendations, and a resume of the discussions regarding

them:, are to be found in Appendices D to H.

FUTURE PLANS
At the finz] plenary session it was voted that the coramittee, listed on page 1
of this report, continue in existence {0 prepare a Report of this Coniference, (o collect
and exchange curriculs of courses given in Computer Science, to actas a clearing
house for suggestions and problems related to University Computing Centers and to
arrange for further Conierences of this sort in the future, if and when the occasion
warraats it. The Headguarters Office of the Am erican Mathematical Society has agreed

to arrange for the necessary stail work to implement these possible actions.
