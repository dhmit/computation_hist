A PROPOSAL FOR THE USE OF A CONDENSED SYMBOLIC NOTATION ON
704 TAPES AND FOR THE USE OF CONDENSED SYMBOLIC CARDS

by John McCarthy
January 3, 1957

l. INTRODUCTION

The SHARE subroutines distributed to date total some 30,000
instructions, and routines are being written at an increasing
rate. It is already impossible to put all the available sub-
routines on one library tape, and in any case a full library tape
would lead to excessive assembly time for programs calling for
routines coming from near the end of the tape.

By using a condensed symbolic notation it is possible to
store routines on a library tape at 20 to 30 times the present
density. (A count on a program selected at random gave a factor
of 28, though this seemed to be a particularly favorable case.)
This increase in density is to be achieved by increasing the size
of the records used, trimming the comments from the Instructions,
omitting most of the REM instructions, and packing the instructions
continuously on tape with symbols to distinguish where one instruc-
tion leaves off and another begins. (At present a library tape is
written in .L inch 80 character records with +75 inch inter-record
gaps.)

Other proposals for library condensation have been made which
involve writing the instructions in relocatable binary form. We
think that there are many advantages to preserving a symbolic no-
tation. These include the fact that symbolic references to posi-
tions in the subroutines are allowed, and that subroutines with
program parameters set at the time of assembly can be used.

In addition we propose the use of condensed symbolic cards.
Programs on condensed symbolic cards will have from one sixth to
one tenth the bulk of standard symbolic cards, and in the proposed
System they can be mixed with standard symbolic cards at assembly.
The condensed cards cannot conveniently be prepared by hand key-
punching, and a program to prepare them from standard decks has
been written.

In the following sections we describe the condensed symbolic
notation, the use of the revised library system, the use of con-
densed symbolic cards with assembly, and the use of the program
which prepares the condensed library tapes and the condensed sym-
bolic cards.

The modification TO the assembly program 1s written except
for the section of about 100 additional instructions which will
provide for the reading of condensed cards. The program for the
preparation of library tapes and the preparation of condensed
cards is completely written. Neither of the programs has yet been
punched Up.

A number of desirable features, designed TO protect against
human and machine error, nave not been incorporated in the pres—
ent system for lack of time.

The features described herein are tentative and subject TO
modification by persons willing to argue and tO program thelr

proposals.

2. CONDENSED SYMBOLIC NOTATION

Condensed symbolic notation 1s a variant of the notation read
by the SHARE aszembly program UASAP, with which the reader is as-
sumed to be familiar, and which we shall refer to as standard
symbolic notation.

The first character of a condensed symbolic instruction is a
digit from 1 to 8. If the digit 4d is between 1 and 6 it indicates
a SHARE symbolic instruction in which the first non blank column
is column d. If the digit is 7 the location field is blank and
the first non blank is in column 8. If the digit is 8 the first
non blank is in column 12. The instruction 1s then written con-
tinuously with no gaps. For all instructions and pseudo-instruc-
tions except BCD and REM the condensed instruction ends with the
first blank and the next instruction follows immediately.

EXAMPLE: The program A CLA X
STO Y
TSX FN,4
3
would be condensed to 6ACLAX T7STOY T7TSXFN,L 83.

In the case of a BCD instruction there is no blank at the
end since the digit in column 12 tells when the instruction ends.
REM instructions are ordinarily suppressed by the condensation
program. However, the programmer can insist that an REM instruc-
tion be Included by putting a digit d or an X in column 6, in
which case d six character words of remark will be included in
the condensed symbolic program, where X denotes 10.

Another feature of the condenser program is that for all
instructions but the HED instruction, if the location field is
less than 6 characters it is pushed as far to the right as pos-
sible to save space in the condensed program.

Condensed symbolic programs can be produced in two forms -
as cards and as library programs on a tape. In the card form
the condensed instructions run continuously through columns 1
to 72 of the card. An instruction may have part of it on one
card and part on the next. A revision of UASAP which will read

condensed symbolic cards together with standard symbolic cards


Ly.
has been prepared. For the use of this assembly each group of con-
densed cards must be preceded by a standard symbolic card with CND
as its operation part. On the first card following the CND card,
the condensed symbolic instructions need not start in column 1, but
once started must run continuously from card to card because the as—
sembly program will interpret the first blank which is superfluous
from the point of view of condensed symbolic instructions as a sig-
nal to read another card record and go back to standard symbolic
notation,

This usage makes it possible to make modifications to a program
on condensed cards by duplicating the card on which the instruction
1s to be changed up to the point of the change, leaving it blank
from that point on, then inserting one or more ordinary symbolic
cards with the changed instructions, following this with a CND
card and then a copy of the card where the program continues in
condensed form, This last card may be blank up to a certain point.

Because of the way the condenser interprets an END card, no
END cards will appear in a condensed deck produced by the program,
A condensed program will always end in enough blanks to signal a
return to standard symbolic notation so that standard END card can
be added.

CAUTION: When inserting standard cards in a condensed deck it
1s necessary to make sure that the last condensed instruction to be
kept 1s followed by an extra blank to signal the return to standard
notation, If the last instruction to be kept has its last character
(usually a blank) in column 72, it will be necessary to add a blank
card.

It 1s not envisaged that condensed symbolic cards will be
prepared by hand keypunching because the chances for error are too
great and 1t is not easy to correct an error that makes an instruc-
tion too short or too long. Instead it is proposed that condensed
decks be prepared by the condenser program from standard symbolic
decks,

A condensed library tape has the following form, The sub-
routines are in LOO word (2400 character) records, except that the
last record of a subroutine will usually be shorter than LOO words.

The first word of the first record of a subroutine is the name of


5.
the subroutine, and the first word of every other record of a sub-
routine consists of 6 blanks. (No subroutine may have 6 blanks as
its name.) Zach subroutine is concluded by an END pseudo-instruc-—
tion which is not included in the program produced by the assembly.
The library tape ends with an end of file mark, but there are no
end of file marks between subroutines.

The factor of condensation over standard notation is between
6 and 10 for symbolic cards and between 20 and 30 for a library

tape.

3. LIBRARY INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE REVISED SHARE ASSEMBLER USING A
CONDENSED LIBRARY TAPE

In the preceding section it was explained how condensed sym-—
bolic cards can be included in the decks presented to the revised
assembler. In this section we explain how subroutines are called
for from the condensed library tape. This is different from the
way they are called for in the present version of the assembler.

For each library subroutine the programmer wishes to incor-
porate in his program he must write at least two LIB instructions.
First he must list all the library subroutines he wants at the be-
ginning of his program, or at least at a point in his program be-
fore he wants any subroutines to appear. As in the present assembly
procedure a library instruction is a card with LIB in the operation
field and the name of the subroutine in the location field (columns
1 to 6). The first group of LIB instructions must mention the de-
sired subroutines in the order in which they appear on the con-
densed library tape and must be followed by an LIB card with blank
location field. When the assembler gets to this group of cards it
extracts the condensed subroutines from the condensed library tape,
expands them and writes them on a tape in expanded form, and makes
a table of contents of the subroutines mentioned, which it puts in
core storage. No instructions are added to the program being as-
sembled at this point. Each LIB instruction must be given again
at the point in the program where the subroutine is to appear, It
1s not required in the second calling that the subroutines be
given in any particular order, although if they are given in the
same order as before, assembly time will be reduced. (not usually
by very much). A subroutine may be asked for more than once in
the body of the program (for open subroutines) but must be men-
tioned only once the first time.

Failure to observe these rules will lead to a stop in the
assembly.

In addition to the public condensed library tape it is pos-—-
sible to use any number of private condensed library tapes which
may be mounted as tapes 5 to 10. If a subroutine is to be ob-
tained from a private library tape, the number of the tape is
written in column 12 of the first LIB instruction mentioning the


To

the subroutine. (X is the digit for tape 10). No two subroutines
called for may have the same name even if they are to come from
different tapes, though a subroutine called for may have the same

name as one on a different tape which is not called for.

EXAMPIE: In this example two subroutines are taken from the public

library tape, and one 1s taken from tape 5. The latter is inserted

in the program in two places.

Operational features of the revised assembly.

The public library tape should be mounted as tape li, a blank
tape mounted as tape mounted as tape 3, and any private library
tapes requested mounted with the numbers requested. These numbers
must be from 5 to 10. Otherwise the procedure 1s the same as

described in the UASAP writeup.

Lio USE OF THE CONDENSER PROGRAM

The condenser program has two purposes and may be used
for either of them or for both simultaneously as determined by
gense switches,

The first function is to prepare a condensed library
tape or to make a new library tape which is a modification of
an old one with insertions and deletions.

The second function 1s To prepare condensed symbolic
cards, The use of the sense switches is as follows,

If a library tape 1s to be prepared sense switch 3 is up.

If preparation of a library tape is to be suppressed sense

switch 3 is down. A blank tape is mounted as tape 3 if =

library tape 1s desired.

If the new library tape is to be obtained from an old one by
insertions and deletions, the old tape 1s mounted as tape 2 (with

2 blank tape 3 for the new tape) and sense switch 2 is up. IT

there is no old library tape (the condensed library is being started
fpom scratch) sense switch 2 should be down.

If condensed symbolic cards are desired for the new
subroutines (you can't get them for the ones on the old library
tape) switch L should be up and a blank tape mounted as tape lL.
If condensed cards are nov desired switch li should be down.

The tape li produced by the program is run on the: off line tape
to cards machine to produce the condensed symbolic cards.

We shall first describe the preparation of the programs to
be condensed in the simple case when there is no old library
tape. First comes a blank card. Then come the subroutines in the
order in which they are to appear on the library tape. Each
subroutine is to be preceded by an LIB card with the name of
the subroutine in the location field, and 1s to be followed by
and END card. The resulting deck is to be read on the off line
card to tape machine and followed by an end of file mark. This
tape is mounted as tape 1.

Finally, the condenser program should be loaded from cards.

The decks to be condensed may include condensed cards
provided that the same conventions are observed as when condensed
cards are included in an assembly. Namely, each group of condensed

cards must be preceded by a standard CND card and the group must

If the modification is an insertion, it. condenses the first subrout-

records onto tape li if condensed cards are called for. Then it
looks on tape 2 for the subroutine mentioned in the next modification
instruction, After making the last modification it copies the rest
of the subroutines on tape: 2 onto tape 3, and then condenses the
remaining subroutines on tape 1, and puts them onto the end of
tape 3.

lt 1s necessary to decide whether condensed cards are to be

made for all of the new subroutines or for none.
