The peripheral equipment such as magaetic tape unlis, ‘magpetic drums, eard
readers, card panch end cerd printers are identical to those employed on the
Type 702 machiue, the only distinotion being that the 700 unit employs suitable
control units to sonvers data coming from the main freme %o that used on the
gtandard péripheral equipmente As“previously mentioned, the magnetic core memories
replace the former cathodeéray tﬁbe storage which 1s used on the 702. The cores
are arranged to provide repdom acesss of any O sharacter instruction in o017

702 machina) Astually a 7=bit code is used to represent each sharacter and aocess
