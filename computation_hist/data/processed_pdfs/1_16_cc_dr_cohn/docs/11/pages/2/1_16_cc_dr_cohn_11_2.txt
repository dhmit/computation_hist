THE DENSITY OF ABELIAN CUBIC FIELDS 477

defined (at first) for Re s>1, where ¢ are the primes =1 (mod 6).
To estimate U(y) we introduce the primes r=—1 (mod 6) and
start with the identity:

Bs) = __MMEI_"'_"}__ :
IIa - 911 = 10 = ¢ IIa + )

We note that each product of “curly brackets,” [[{ - - -}, is ab-
solutely convergent for at least Re s>1/2, while

6 [IIa = ¢9IIa = 9] = ()1 — 2-)(1 = 3-).

Moreover,

(5)

(1) L) = 3 (=3/mm— = (1 + 22 [T1Q = ¢TI + 9]

is a convergent series for Re s >0, with the special value L(1) =x3-%/2
by Dirichlet’s formula for quadratic class number [2, p. 373]. Hence
from the known behavior of {(s), it follows that the difference ¢(s)
—c/(s—1) is analytic at s=1, where (using {(2) =7?/6) we easily
find
1/2 o
o B -1
2 g(g + 1)
As before, ¢ are the primes =1(mod 6). Now from the behavior of
¢(s) at s=1, together with the behavior of {(s) in the critical strip, we
can show that

We omit the details since Landau’s Handbuch presents them not only
for the prime number theorem [3, pp. 180-193] but also for a prob-
lem even involving a similar generating function [3, pp. 649-660].
Formula (1) finally follows through the use of formula (2). Q.E.D.
