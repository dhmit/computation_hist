We carry the investigation only as far as n = 3.

Starting with quadratic (complex) modules, we find that stabij :

their negatives), lying on a circle with center at the origin Thisv a; & and

only stable quadratic (complex) modules are gwen by the module oD 'whe o t he

In the case of cubic modules with one real and two com

the order © of I has one fundamental unit w = (w,, w, ws3). Now w, is not
real nor is any power of w, real, since the only real numbers in a complex cubic
field are rational. This shows that the argument of w, is incommensurable
with 2z, and therefore the directions of the complex vectors w,™, (m =0
+l,£2,...) are everywhere dense mod 2. Thus for every z; of minimai
norm, the set Z = Z,W" has the same norm while the projections R; s[z], Rs [z},
(l;z,[Z]', each in two-c:lirr?ensional space, are everywhex:e. dense with respect to
1rec't.1on, thus establishing the positive span and stability. (For an illustrative
stability configuration see (7).)
