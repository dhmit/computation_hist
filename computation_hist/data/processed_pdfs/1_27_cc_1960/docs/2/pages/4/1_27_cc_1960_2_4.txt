the combination of research and education for which MIT 1s pre~
eminent. This work deserves support by IBM, in addition to the
educational activities which are already being supported by the
present contribution of the 704. They can most effectively be
supported by the installation of a 7090, replacing the 704, in

Outlook for the Future: The activities mentioned above
are only a part of the research, at MIT and at the associated .
institutions» which desires to use the facilities of the Computation
Center. Obviously no single computing machine can be itself satisfy

Even with this sort of limitation on the use
facilities? the demands on the Center will grow” But the growths
if thus limitedg cany we believes be handled by the‘
effort of IBM and MIT” A 7090 within the year would\not delay most
of the workloutlined above,toQ{seriously. And9 as outlined belowg
it would be able to handle them for several years, while plans are
made for the next stepo 0n the other handy if a 7090 cannot be
