Dear Professor Wang:

As I told you at the mathematical soclety meet-
ing, Professor Morse has authorized me to offer you
$1250 per month for two or three months this summer
at your option plus travel expenses from and to
New Jersey. Marvin Minsky and I and a number of our
students are much interested in theorem proving by
machine, and we all hope that you will be able to
come., A private office can be arranged as you re-
quested.

I have started on a new version of your predi-

cate calculus algorithm about which I expect to
wrlte you in detall later.

Best regards,

John McCarthy
