Subject: Electronic Data Processing Equipmént in the Computation Center

 

The purpose of this memorandum is to provide a list of the number
and type of data processing machines available in the MIT Computation Center.
In addition, the moathly rental costs of each unit has been adjusted to agree
with the new reatal figures which are effective kMarch 1, 1957, Table I contains
a list of the machines which are used as part of the 704 Calculator on an on-line
or an off-~line basis, By off-line we mean the peripheral cquipment such as,
tape-to—-card converter, card-to-tape converter, and the tape-controlled printer,
respectively.

In addition to the electronic data processing equipment associated
with the Type 704 Calculator, there are certain electric- accounting machines
{EAM) which complement the 704 and these will bhe located in the basement of
the West wing 1in Room 26-058, Table II provides a breskdown of the number and
type of electric accounting machines which will complement the 704 Calculator.

It is interesting to note that the combined monthly rental of the
704 Calculator and the EAM eguipment is as follows:

704  $43,600

EAN 1,760

Total,, $45,380

Thus, it is apparent that IBM's contribution to the Computation Center in terms
of machine equipment alone is $45,360 per month or $544,320 per year,
