path of approach and in fact these paths of approach can even he made to
lie in a Stolz neighborhood of preassigned arbitrarily small width. VVlHtIlg-y

At any rate it is now apparent that the dlophantine nature of a singu.

larity of a theta function governs to a great extent the asymptotic behavior
at the singularity, and even the function itself.
