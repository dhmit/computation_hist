internal reflections in the backing and the results for a
film with optically parallel surfaces in the special case of

Therefore, T is seen to be positive in either case, asit
should be. The application of Pierce’s tables caused an
indeterminacy in the sign that could not be settled very
easily; the complex variable apprqach was therefore
thought to present the results more rigorously.

for various thicknesses and optical constants of the

formulas just derived. Substituting Eqs. (20), (21), al}d
(22) into (3) and (4) gives the reflection and transmis-
sion of a metal film on a thick backing by means of
intensity addition. It is not feasible to prove analytically
that the results obtained in Case VIII by the two meth-
ods are equal, but the numerical results shown In Table I
demonstrate that within the accuracy afforded by the
tables used the results are identical in all examples tried.

CONCLUSIONS AND COMPARISONS
WITH OTHER AUTHORS

Expressions for the reflection and transmission by
semi-infinite nonabsorbing backings, uncovered as well
as covered with a thin metal film, and for normally inci-
dent radiation have been presented. In Appendix I the
results obtained using these expressions are compared
with the results obtained using the expressions of
Hadlev and Dennison® for the same systems. It is also

Case V.) The numerical results using his formulas
differed from those obtained by using intensity addition
of internal reflections in the backing. Mathematically,
his treatment defines 6 so that

R(a=0, 0)=R(a=0, 0;)
and
T(a=0, 0)=T(a=0, 03)

when the thickness of the absorbing film is zero, a:nd
then assumes that for any thickness of the absorbing
film

 

 

R(a, 0)=R(a, 0,) and T(a, 0)=7T(a, Os).

However, the value of 6 for which R and 7" attain
their average values depends on @ and therefore cannot
be given a constant value as was done by Goldschmidt.

Koller* objected to this treatment by Goldschm.idt
and attempted to carry out the rigorous averaging
process by substituting for individual functions of 6,
their average values:

cosf=sinf=0 and cos’0=sin’0=73.

 

 

Mathematically, this amounts to the assumption,

I'(sinf), cosf= F(sinf), (cosh),

where I' refers to the reflection and transmission coeffi-
cients. Such an identity holds only for linear functions of
sinf and cosf, which R and 7 are not. Therefore, Koller’s
substitution is not exact.

large ranges of thicknesses or wavelengths or both, and
that for certain values of these ranges the corresponding
range in 6 increases with thickness of the backing. The
assumption of a large range of 8 is implied also in Koller’s
choice of an interval = for his integration, but his
average does not approach the result of intensity addi-
tion as a limit.

For the case of a nonabsorbing layer without metal
Koller’s formulas reduce to

(ny2—1)2 81,2

s (1) +4m? (it 1)24-dmy?

Table I shows Koller’s numerical results as well as
those from Egs. (29) to (32), (36), and (37) for the same
values of all parameters. The agreement between the
amplitude addition and the intensity addition as well
as the disagreement between Koller’s results and those
obtained by rigorous averaging is demonstrated. Values
for the transmission were easily carried out to six
figures. To avoid complicating the computations for the
reflection further by accurate interpolation in tables, we
merely carried five significant figures; the maximum
discrepancy observed of two units in the fifth place lies
within the expected accuracy of the tables.

Although the difference between results of intensity
addition and those obtained by Koller is not large for
those values of the parameters chosen for the examples
in Table I, it is significant that the intensity addition
leads to correct results, while Koller’s formulas do not.

N.B. Intensity addition, when applied, is limited to
the thick, nonabsorbing backing; for the metal film,
amplitude addition is always used.
