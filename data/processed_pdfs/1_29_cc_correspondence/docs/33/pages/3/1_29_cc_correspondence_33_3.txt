tape input and the inter-job time is reduced
to some slight tape manipulation by the
Monitor.

Manuals on FMS and FAP will be made available soon at the Center.
Because of the attractiveness of the above Fortran-FAP
monitor system and the effectiveness of the Fortran compiler
1t 1s expected that a major portion of the users of the Center
will prefer to use the system for any new work. The Center
staff will recommend this system to all new programmers who
seek advice. This will be the case for those if'row
the New England colleges when distance and debugging inconven-
ience are a burden., I& is expected that considerable machine
time will be saved if it is possible to use FMS as the principal
operating system of the Center.
The above recommendation of the Center, however, should
not be viewed as excluding other operating procedures with
the computer. In particular there are two principal reasons
for deviation:

l. ease of transition from the 704 to the
709, and

2. 1nadequacies or weaknesses (from the user's
point-of-view) in the Fortran-FAP Monitor
System.

B. SOS System
As 1s fairly well known, the original discussion of
the 709 computer stimulated various persons in SHARE to
develop an entirely new programming system. This system was

to be reasonably compatible with SAP on the 704, be a monitor
