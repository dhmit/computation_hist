1. Job Input Decks

The IBM 709 FORTRAN Monitor will process the following types

of job-input:

Multiple Compilation/Assembling. Input will consist of
a number of FORTRAN or FAP source decks. These are to
be compiled or assembled only. The input deck for each

such job will contain, in the order listed:

I.D. Card
Source deckl, preceded by control cards governing
output, if any

Source deckz, preceded etc....

Source deckn

â€™ a"Ne

END-OF-FILE card if input from on-line cards

Compilation/Assembling and Execution. Input will consist

of one main program and all its subprograms to be compiled
and executed together with the data. These programs may

be a mixture of FORTRAN or FAP source subprograms and
machine-language object subprograms. The object subprograms
may be relocatable columnar binary output from either a
previous FORTRAN compilation (with the Transfer card, if
any, removed), or from a FAP assembly, or from other hand-
coded subroutines for FORTRAN. The input deck for a job

of this type will contain in the order listed:

I.D. Card
XEQ Card
Object program or Sourge program, , preceded by any

relevant output option control cards
