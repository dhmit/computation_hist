Me, James G. Kelso .
Executive Ass Stent to
~~. the President :
~~ Room 3-208 = - MIT

Dear Jims pi
This note is in reply to your request for some information on
Mr, Philippe David. Mr. David plans te leave for this country om

February 4th, arrive in Cambridge on February llth, and â€˜stay at MIT
for approximately seven months.

jo {nvited Mr. David to MIT last September on the suggestion
of Phil Morse. A colleague of Mr. David, Mr. Jacques Lestel, visited
us this past fall. David and Lestel are both members of a French
Operations Research Firm whose President is Mr, Charles Salsmann.
The Firm is interested in learning more about the simulation of
economic systems.

On the basis of discussions with Phil Morse and Jacques Lestel,
1 believe Mr. David expects to spend most of his time working on my
computer simulation study of the American economy. This means he
will work mostly at the Computation Center and probably will make a
substantial request for 704 time. We have set aside some working
area for Mr. David at the 8chool of Industrial Management and have
asked for some additional space at the Computation Center.

Mr. David will receive no remuneration from MIT but is, I
believe, receiving a grant under the auspices of NATO. This grant
is intended to allow professional persons in Burope to work with
professional persons in America over an extended period of time,

Please let me know if there is any further information you
would like to have. I appreciate your help in obtaining guest status
for Mr. David.

Sincerely yours,

Yolo
Martin Greenberger
