6. Experimental analysis and control using data
fransmitted directly between computer and experiment.

T. Investigation of microprogramming and other methods
for Increasing the flexibility of computer design. The possibility
of inclusion of a very flexible control unit in a large-scale
computer which would permit ready alteration of an order code.

8. Investigation of techniques for intercommunication
between computers, including the possibillity of cycles different - -
in length or kind running simultaneously with frequent comparison,
e.8. several single-accumulator computers with common memory ang .
the behavior of a computer with multiple accumulators. Some of
these properties can be simulated on a 704 by utilization of addi-
tional drums and magnetic core banks.

9. Computer estimation of problem time. In linear
problems, estimations of bounds of certain functionals, and thence
convergence criteria for terminating iteration, or switching to a
different iteration. |
