Dear Dr. Verzuh:

ry I am requesting permission for Mr. John Radbill, who is
working under my direction on supersonic flow of air in a tube
(D.1.C. 7359), to use about two hours of Whirlwind time. wk

This project on supersonic flow of air in a tube is
engaged in research sponsored by the Office of Naval Research
on aerodynamic heating. Mr. Radbill will require the use of

whirlwind for the éolution of an apalysis of diffusion cooling.

Sincerely,

Joseph Kaye
