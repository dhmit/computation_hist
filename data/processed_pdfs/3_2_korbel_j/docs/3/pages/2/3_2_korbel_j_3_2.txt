There are four principal aspects of the imvestigatiom of the
behavior of individuals with respect to labor force participation, In
the first place, there is the problem of defining participatiomn itself,
This is the prvoblem of defining the outputs or dependent variables, The
following types of questions are involved, How many hours per week or
weeks in the year must am imdividual work or seek work ia order to qualify
a8 a labor force participant? What criteria should we adopt for deciding
whether an individual who is working part time or mo time is really seeking
full time employment, i,0,, vhether he is a full or part time labor force
participant? What comstitutes "seeking” employment? Should we draw a line
between full and part time participatioam or should we recognize a continuous
gradation? Shall we defime participatiom on the basis of sa imstantaneous
state or a condition over an interval of time?

There being a considerable evolution and literature relating
to these definitiomal problc-s,1 we shall mot add to it, but merely adopt
the current definitions which seeam to suit our needs and which will permit
us to make use of the most promising available data, An attempt will be
made, however, to recognize gradatioms of current attachmeant to the labor
force on the basis of hours worked per week *

The second aspect of the problem relates to the independent
variables or inputs, on the basis of which we shall seek to explain parti-
cipation and turmover, As has already beem indicated, these will be
thought of as fallimg in the following categories:

1. Characteristics of the individual and his family

a, Demographic

b, Economic

¢, Bducatiomal

d, Past status with respect to the labor ferce

2, Characteristics of the individual's eanvironment

a, Regiom

b, Urbamization

¢, Industrial structure of the surrounding labor
market area

recognized by comsidering the number of weeks worked during the
