The well-known problem of the end effects in a cylinder of finite length has been circumvented by the use
of spheroidal rather than cylindrical apparatus. After a general theory of heat flow is given, applications
demonstrate the mathematical difficulties caused by discontinuities in the curvature of the surface of the
heat conductor. The suitability of the spheroidal shape is demonstrated, and corresponding heat flow equa-
tions are derived demonstrating the effects of the variable distance between any two isotherms on the amount
of heat crossing any unit area of an isotherm. It is proven that the amount of heat flowing through a slice of
a spheroidal isotherm made perpendicular to the axis of the spheroid is proportional to the width of the
slice, and independent of the position of the slice with respect to the spheroid. This theorem is applied to
find the heat distribution necessary to keep the core of the apparatus at uniform temperature. Because all
measurements are made at thermal equilibrium, a rough estimate is given for the time necessary to reach

equilibrium.

INTRODUCTION

NE idealized experiment for the measurement of
thermal conductivity of ceramic materials at a
high temperature consists of surrounding an infinitely
long, uniformly heated cylindrical core by a hollow
cylinder of the ceramic, and using the cylindrical form
of the heat flow equation in determining the conduc-
tivity from the average temperature gradient across a
certain distance in the ceramic.

The greatest deviation from idealized conditions is
due to the finite length of the cylinder; and the present
paper aims to justify the choice of an envelope in which
the location of the isotherms, as well as the heat distri-
bution necessary to keep the core heated uniformly, can
be controlled. Whereas initially it was thought that
hemispherical guards at the ends of the cylinder could
be designed in such a manner that all lateral flow in the
cylinder could be stopped, the analysis given below
demonstrates that no such guards could eliminate non-
radial flow entirely, while most heat will flow out per
unit area through the guards, so that special precautions
would have to be taken to prevent their cooling. It was
therefore decided to streamline the apparatus into a
spheroid, for which heat flow equations are derived
below.

A. GENERAL THEORY

In the envelope type of thermal conductivity tests a
temperature gradient is maintained across the material
to be measured by construction of a closed vessel with
axial symmetry, the inside of which is heated uniformly,
while the outside is kept at uniform room temperature.
The core may be heated either by fitting a metal sus-
ceptor inside and placing the whole vessel in an inductor
coil, or by wrapping platinum wire about the core,
heating it by means of the heat developed in the plati-
num resistance.

The material to be measured may be surrounded by
an insulating layer of brick in order to allow higher
mean temperatures in the ceramic layer. The conduc-
tivity of the ceramic material is found by measuring
the temperature gradient set up in it by a known quan-
tity of heat flowing across it.

The shape of the core is arbitrary, and is chosen to fit
experimental convenience. The heat flow should be per-
pendicular to surfaces with a discontinuity in conduc-
tivity, so that the surfaces =u, and #=wu; in Fig. 1
are determined by the thickness of the layers “a” and
“db” as well as the shape of the core. Therefore, we use

orthogonal coordinates #= const. (isotherms), v= const.
(surfaces of flow), and ¢= const. (planes through the
axis of symmetry).

All observations are made at thermal equilibrium;
the settling time to reach equilibrium has been found
to be relatively independent of the shape of the vessel,
and may be found for special simple cases.

Therefore, we proceed to solve the laplace equation
subject to boundary conditions of constant core and
environment temperatures, and continuous heat flow
in the walls of the vessel:

V20=0. (1)
When u=u;, 6=0;.
When #=us, 0 and k38/du continuous (k= thermal

conductivity).
If 6=A(x) is a solution of Eq. (1), then the solution
satisfying the boundary conditions is:

0=0,+— (63—6;) in region “a” (2a)

Ra Asz— 1

k A—A;

where A=A(x); Ax=A(u1); As=A(us), Ra,s=conduc-
tivity of region “a, 5,”

(As— Ay)/k= [(As— Ao) ky] (Ae— Av)/ka].

The amount of heat crossing an isotherm per unit
time per unit area is

W=—kVl=— (0;—01)kVA/(Az— Ar).

N.B. Though A depends on % only, VA is a function of
u as well as of v.

The amount of heat crossing an entire isotherm per
unit time is:

00/dt=— (03—0)kF FVA-dA/(As— Ay),
where

$ FVA dA

indicates integration over the entire isotherm (over-all
values of » and ¢); the expression is independent of x.

AGRO) AA :

A(kaba)/ A (Rob) = AAo/AAs. (4)

In Eq. (3) the right-hand side is found from the
geometry of the vessel, so that measuring Af and
0Q/ dt gives k, whereas Eq. (4) may be used to check
the result found for k, when kj is known, by measuring
Af, as well as Af,.

The amount of heat crossing an isotherm per unit
time is given above. The amount of heat crossing a
plane slab of comparable thickness across the same
difference in temperature is proportional to the area
of such a slab. In order to find out how large a slab
would correspond to a vessel of comparable thickness,
we equate the rate of heat transfer for the vessel and
the slab, finding for the area of the slab:

A= (uz—u)) F FVAAA/(A3— Ay). (5)

There is always an isotherm with just that area; the
area being dependent on u, we can then find the loca-
tion of this “average isotherm.”

Vo is inversely proportional to the separation of the
isotherms. Since heat flow is trapped between surfaces
of flow, V8dA must be constant between any two flow
surfaces. Therefore, near regions of high isotherm prox-
imity, the flow converges (see Fig. 2).

Isotherms always crowd together near highly curved
portions, so that we conclude that the lines of flow are
also quite dense near such highly curved regions of the
isotherms. Therefore, we expect that most heat leaves
the core where the core is highly curved.

B. CHOICE OF THE SHAPE OF THE CORE

Experimental conditions require an elongated core,
possibly a cylinder. In order to minimize heat flow from

the ends, hemispherical guards were installed. Analysis
of the heat flow in spheres and in cylinders shows that
it is impossible to have isotherms that are described by
cylindrical surfaces joined along a plane to hemispheri-
cal surfaces; any different shape of the isotherms, how-
ever, causes heat flow across some portion of the plane
of junction, so that no guards eliminate nonradial flow
entirely. Therefore, a spheroidal core was designed, and
the surfaces u=1u;, us, and u3, together with the flow
surfaces v= const., were found to be confocal spheroids
and hyperboloids of revolution of two sheets.

becomes small compared to the radius.

core in the curved hemispherical portion of the wall.
Although it is possible to vary the scale of this part of

the drawing by varying the average conductivity of the
guards, it is not possible to match up the hyperbolic
temperature distribution in the guards with the logarith-
mic function in the cylinder. Generally, when two
regions are joined such that their joint surface contains
a discontinuity, then heat flow somewhere along their
plane of junction causes distortion of their isotherms to
join smoothly.

When heat flows out perpendicularly through a
spheroidal isotherm, the amount flowing through any
slice made perpendicular to the axis of symmetry is
directly proportional to the width of the slice, inde-
pendent of the position of the slice with respect to the
spheroid.

G. RESISTANCE HEATING OF THE CORE

The theorem stated above shows that, in order to
keep the core heated uniformly, the amount of heat sup-
plied must be the same for any unit length of the core.
Since the amount of heat generated in the wire wrapped
around the core is proportional to the length of wire,
we must distribute the winding density suitably. As-
suming that each turn of winding is a circle, the length
of wire used per unit axial length is given by:

dL/dz=2mrn(z),

where 7(z)=the number of windings per unit axial
length.

If dL/dz is to be constant, n(z) = 1/r. It is impractical
to use such a variable distribution; instead, the core is
subdivided lengthwise into an odd number of equally
wide sections, each section being wound uniformly by
the same length of wire. The number of windings of the
1th section is then given by:

ni/ Sordz= 1/4 cy

where A; is the area of the lengthwise cross section of
the th slice.

Hence, the amount of windings for each section is
given by

This will be discussed in a subsequent paper.

I. TIME TO SETTLE TO EQUILIBRIUM

The core is heated fairly rapidly, and consequently
thermal equilibrium is disturbed. The time that elapses
between disturbance and re-establishment of thermal
equilibrium is made up of two terms: the time needed to
heat up the core and the time needed in addition until
thermal equilibrium exists again in the walls. Since
infinitely slow heating does not disturb equilibrium,
while instantaneous heating produces the worst dis-
turbance, we can get a fair estimate of the settling time
by assuming instantaneous heating, thus somewhat
underestimating the time lag for heating the core, but
overestimating the time needed for thermal equilibrium
to re-establish itself.

The temperature obeys the following time-dependent
equation:
Vi0=(1/h*)060/dt, where h?

= thermal diffusivity (6)

subject to the boundary conditions:
1=0: 6(u,0)=s(u) for u>u,,
where s(x) =steady-state temp. before heating.
t=0: 0(uy,t)=6,,
where 6. is the final temperature of the core.
0(us, t)=s(us).
The solution is given by:
0(u, 1) =s(u)+[(As—A)/(As— A1) J(0.— 01) + T(u, 1), (7)

where T'(u,t) satisfies Eq. (6), and vanishes at /—so
(T represents transients), while

T(u, 0) . (Az—A) (0c—61)/(As— Ay).

It is difficult to solve Eq. 6 for spheroidal coordinates,
since in the nonsteady state there are no spheroidal
isotherms in the walls. However, the settling time may
be approximated by finding it for a spherical wall and
for a plane slab. These two results agree so well that the
same answer may be assumed for the spheroid. For the

The settling time is usually defined as the time neces-
sary for the transient to reach 1 percent of its initial
value, and is seen to be proportional to the square of the
thickness, and inversely proportional to the thermal
diffusivity. For a double wall, we consider the two
layers as being heated in series; the diffusivity being
much greater for the inner layer and its thickness less,
we regard only the settling time for the insulating outer
layer as finite. The series for T(r, #) converges so rapidly
when the exponential term becomes of the order of
1 percent, that we drop all but the first term. The coeffi-
cient of the exponential term varies with the shape of
the vessel, but this does not influence the settling time.
It is seen that the spheroidal wall would settle to equi-
librium most rapidly at the thinnest section, which
causes heat to flow laterally until equilibrium is estab-
lished throughout. The settling time is thus approxi-
mated by:

ls=(2 In10)d@?/=%h?,

where d=greatest thickness of wall layer with lowest
diffusivity, #*= lowest diffusivity.
