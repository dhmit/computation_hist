Dear Dr. Bauer:

I am one of the authors of the Pitman publication, "Faster Than
Thought", which you may have read. Pitmans have asked me to revise
the chapter on "Games", and I wish to include a description of the
work done in America in applying computers to various games. Ed
Ward suggested that you could give me some information about this.
If not, perhaps you could suggest someone else I might contact.

I would appreciate an early reply, since I have to complete the
revision by September 1, 1956.

Yours sincerely,

s/ Audrey Wallis
