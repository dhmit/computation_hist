The electrical conductivity of gold blacks is evaluated from reflection and transmission measurements in
the far infrared. For sufficiently thin samples and sufficiently large wavelengths a closed expression is derived,
relating the electrical conductivity of the gold black directly to the absorption and transmission coefficients.
It is found that the electrical conductivity varies with wavelength, and for wavelengths larger than 105
microns this variation is attributed to a relaxation effect. The relaxation time of electrons in gold blacks is

found to agree closely with that in bulk gold.

INTRODUCTION

ETAL blacks have been found! to have a very low
density, and yet they conduct a direct current.
This has led to the conclusion that their structure is
yarn-like, with conducting strands spaced relatively
far apart. Maxwell's theory of electromagnetic radia-
tion has been applied to correlate the optical (infrared)
and electrical properties of the blacks. When radiation is
incident on a black, a rapidly alternating field acts on
the electrons in the black, and the conductivity ex-
presses the response of the electrons to the imposed
electrical field. Several factors may make the conductiv-
ity dependent on the wavelength.

(A) Gaps in the metal strands consisting of either
insulating impurities or air, do not pass a direct current,
but may act as condensers. Since the impedance of a
branch of an electrical network containing a condenser
depends on the frequency, the apparent conductivity of
interrupted strands in gold black changes with the
frequency of the incident infrared radiation. Thus the
“optical conductivity’’ computed from transmission and
reflection data is actually an admittivity. With increas-
ing frequency of the incident radiation more strands
become capable of conducting current. Therefore this
“condenser effect” causes the optical conductivity to
decrease with increasing wavelength of the incident
radiation.

(B) According to Drude? and Zener? electrons have a
finite relaxation time, which causes them to lag behind
the imposed emf. This lag increases with increasing
frequency of the imposed field. This “relaxation effect”
causes the effective conductivity to increase with in-
creasing wavelength of the incident radiation.

(C) At resonance frequencies the optical absorptivity,
and hence the conductivity computed from optical
measurements, passes through a maximum.

For gold blacks the effects of the three factors (A),
(B), and (C) appear to predominate in different wave-

length regions. Resonance frequencies lie mostly in the
visible and near infrared regions. For wavelengths
greater than 100 microns only those strands appear to
conduct which can conduct direct current. Conductivity
across gaps only occurs appreciably for wavelengths
shorter than 100 microns, as will be shown below. Since
the measurements reported in this paper were all made
with radiation of wavelength greater than 100 microns,
the relaxation effect is the dominant one to be con-
sidered here.

THEORY, PART I. CONDUCTIVITY AS A FUNCTION OF
ABSORPTION AND TRANSMISSION

Harris, Beasley, and Loeb* have derived expressions
for the reflection and transmission of radiation by thin
conducting films as functions of the optical constants,
n and k, of the film, the thickness of the film, the index
of refraction of a nonabsorbing backing for the film, and
the wavelength of the incident radiation. The backings
used for the gold blacks under consideration here were
examined separately in the far infrared, and were ob-
served to be 100 percent transmitting. Their index of
refraction is therefore effectively unity, so that Case III
of the above reference! applies here:

where o= conductivity of the conducting film, e=per-
mittivity of the conducting film, go= permittivity of
vacuum, w= permeability of the conducting film,
uo= permeability of vacuum, and ¢= velocity of radia-
tion in vacuum. The quantity ucoa is dimensionless, and
is called “reduced conductivity per square” of conduct-
ing film. As will be seen below, it is directly related to
the optical properties of films.

The inverse relations of Egs. (3) and (4) are given by
Eqs. (5) and (6):

Defining the absorption coefficient 4 as
A=1—R-T

and substituting for R and 7 the expressions given in
Eqs. (7) and (8) produces

A/T = (zwa/N)*(ucoa)*+ {1+ (2n%a*/\?) } ucoa. (9)

Equation (9) is very useful for applications in the infra-
red, for it relates the electrical conductivity of the film
directly to the absorption per unit transmission of the
film. The only condition to its application is that the
ratio of film thickness to wavelength be sufficiently
small. While reflection and transmission are themselves
extremely complicated functions of both conductivity
and permittivity of the film as demonstrated by Egs.
(7) and (8), the right hand side of Eq. (9) is independent
of the permittivity of the film, and is a simple quadratic
function of the reduced conductivity per square of film.
As the ratio a/\ approaches zero, ucoa approaches A/T
asymptotically, and ceases to depend explicitly on a/A.
Thus, for thin films, the explicit dependence of ucea on
film thickness is only very slight. This is very important
when the conductivity per square film of metal blacks
is to be determined from experimental data on A/T, for
the density and consequently the thickness of the blacks
are not easily found accurately. The expression 4/7 =
(1—7T—R)/T depends for metal blacks largely on the
transmission, and less so on reflection. This is because
blacks have rather indistinct surfaces and hence small
reflectivity. This reflectivity may be somewhat diffuse
rather than completely specular, a fact not recognized
when the measurements reported here were made. The

aper the reduced conductivity is con-
rail than the optical constants.
However, the optical constants can be calculated, where
desired, by the use of Egs. (5) and (6). When the wave-
length is large compared to the {hicknoss of the gold
black, the expression | (n+ ik)2ma/ A|%is small,® for # and
k rarely exceed 3.5. The following approximations may
be used when | (n+ik)2ma/N|*<K1:

sink .0=2K qa,
cosK .a=21—% (Kqa)*

Substitution of these expressions and Egs. (3) and (4)
into Eqs. (1) and (2) produces:

value for the reflection used may therefore be somewhat
low, but this error does not affect the value of A/T very
much.

November 1953 GOLD BLACKS TRANSMISSION REFLECTION IN FAR INFRARED 1116

The cases where Eq. (9) applies were solved first, and
by extrapolation from the results thus obtained first
estimates were made for the other cases. This procedure
thus yielded twenty-four values for ucoa, namely one for
each of four samples at three wavelengths, assuming
two values of the density ratio of bulk gold to gold black.
Of these twenty-four values most were assumed to be
good approximations because they were obtained from
Eq. (9) under conditions where this equation is pre-
sumably applicable. The remainder were considered
only first estimates in a series of successive approxima-
tions. The entire set of values was subjected to the
following test which served both as a check on the
approximate method, and as part of a successive ap-
proximation method where the need for more accurate
computations was indicated.

From the estimate of ucsa the optical constants » and
k were calculated, using Eqs. (5) and (6). For these
calculations a knowledge of & and wu is required. The
latter quantity can, for non-magnetic films, be set equal
to that of vacuum, i.e. w=wuo. The permittivity of a
mixture is a linear combination of the permittivities of
the components, each component being weighted by its
relative concentration. Gold blacks consist of only a
fraction of a volume percent of gold; their permittivity
can therefore be approximated by that of air e~go. It
should be emphasized that this approximation is only
used in testing the applicability of Eq. (9), but never
to obtain results when Eq. (9) does apply.

Setting u=wuo and e=g, in Eqs. (5) and (6) enables
one to obtain # and k. When zn and % are known, R and 7°
can be calculated from Eqs. (1) and (2); this computa-
tion was carried out on Whirlwind I, the electronic
digital computer at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. From the values of R and 7 thus obtained
A/T was calculated and compared with the observed
value. The values of ucoa leading to computed values of
A/T in agreement with the observed ones are listed in
Table II together with the observed and calculated
values of 4/7. Two interesting observations can be

and that the results for the two extreme values of the

digits are experimentally significant.

THEORY, PART II: RELAXATION TIME OF ELECTRONS
IN METAL BLACKS

The experimental results indicate that the conduc-
tivity at 455u is consistently higher than at 105g.
Harris and Beasly' have indicated a decreasing conduc-
tivity as the wavelength increases form 7u to 15u, this
conductivity being about 1.75 times their dc conduc-
tivity and about twice the value reported in Table II
for 105u. Thus the conductivity goes through a mini-
mum between 7p and 455u. The increase of conductivity
with increasing wavelength on the long-wavelength side
of the minimum indicates that the relaxation effect
predominates here. The decrease of the conductivity
with increasing wavelength on the short-wavelength
side of the minimum indicates that here the condenser
effect predominates. The relaxation effect therefore
appears to predominate in at least the major portion of
the wavelength region 105u <A <4355y, though the exact
position of the minimum is not known. The following
analysis shows, at least semiquantitatively, that the
condenser effect may be neglected in the wavelength
region \> 105u.

The admittance of a system of strands can be esti-
mated by an equivalent electrical circuit containing
condensers and resistors. The fact that blacks conduct
direct currents indicates that there are uninterrupted
conducting paths in the black. These paths may be
quite devious and much longer than the shortest
distance between the electrodes used to measure direct
current conductivity; they are represented in the net-
work by a series of resistances. There may be shorter
paths between the electrodes which pass through gaps
or through nonconducting impurities in the strands.
Such gaps are represented by shunt condensers in the
equivalent circuit. The admittance of these condensers is
zero for direct current, but increases with increasing
frequencies. Therefore an increasing number of paths
participate in passing current as the frequency increases,
so that the conductivity will increase appreciably when
the wave ength becomes less than a critical value Ac. At
this critical wavelength the admittance of the shunt

condenser at least equals that of the shunted resistance,
ie. Cw.=G, where w.=2mc/\c, where ¢ 15 the velocity
of radiation in vacuo, C the capacitance of the condenser
and G the conductance of the shunted resistance.
Therefore A\.=2mcC/G. The conductance and capacl-
tance can be expressed in terms of the conductivity of a
metal strand, o,; the permittivity of a gap, ¢; the cross-
sectional area of a strand, which is also the plate area
of the condenser, 4 ; the length of a strand, /; and the
total length, d, of all the gaps in the strand:

G=0,4/l and C= (ed)/ (4rd).
Therefore,

N= 1dcle/ (0d).

When the permittivity of the gaps equals that of
vacuum, ce= (376.7)~" mho. For bulk gold the conduc-
tivity is of the order of 10° mho/cm; this value 1s an
upper limit for the conductivity of a strand. Denoting
the ratio of the conductivity of a gold strand to that of
bulk gold by “kh” one obtains ,~10% mho/cm,
0<h<1. Therefore A\:~1.33X107" l/dh microns. The
assumption that the condensers do not contribute ap-
preciably to the conductivity of the black 1s justified if

\<100u, ie. if dh/I>1.33X107".

As conservative estimates, let /# be not more than 107%,
and let the total length of gapsina strand add up to not
more than 1 percent of the length of the strand. These
values would lead to a lower limit of dh/l, namely
dh/I~10~4, which still exceeds 1.33X 107% by a large
factor. Therefore it may be concluded that A,< 100g, so
that the condenser effect need not be considered in the
wavelength region A> 100g.

The relaxation effect is therefore very suitably studied
by means of radiation of wavelength greater than 100g.
Drude? and Zener® have considered forces acting on the
electrons that are proportional and opposite in direction
to their velocity, hence frictional in nature. They
derived the following expression for the conductivity:

where o= conductivity, 7o= concentration of electrons,

Odc= limg = 2we* nor. (11)
Dividing Eq. (11) by Eq. (10) gives
(ucoaca/ucoa)=1+7*(2wc/N)> (12)

From Eq. (11) it is seen that dc measurements only
give information about the product of the electron
concentration and the relaxation time. Eq. (12) shows

 

PD A. L. LOEB Vol. 43
that measurement of the conductivity at various wave-
lengths can produce data from which to derive the
relaxation time independently. It 1s hoped that a series
of Hall effect measurements Now being performed will
yield independent information about the electron

concentration.
RESULTS, PART II
The dc Conductivity

Equation (12) can be used to determine the relaxation
time if the reduced conductivity per square, ucoqca, is
known. This value was found by plotting, in Fig. 1,
(ucoa)~ vs (2m/N)% using as experimental values those
reported in Table II. Extrapolating this curve, which
theoretically should be a straight line, gives as the
ordinate intercept (ucoaca)™, for the ordinate axis
represents A= ©. Harris and Beasley! have reported
values of dc conductivity obtained by direct electrical
measurements, which are applicable to the samples
described here. Table IIT lists the values of uco ca deter-
mined both by extrapolation of the data of Table IT and
by direct measurements performed on these samples
prior to the long-wavelength measurements. The extra-
polated values do not agree very closely with those
obtained by direct measurement. The discrepancy is
believed to be the result of slight sintering of the samples
as a result of the measurements with long wavelengths.
While the samples did not appear to the eye to be sin-
tered, and while the transmission at 7 was found to be
practically unchanged after the longer wavelength
measurements had been made, slight sintering does not
affect the optical properties equally at all wavelengths.
The physical reason is that sintering removes some of
those gaps that prevent current flow through inter-
rupted strands at wavelengths greater than 100u. Thus
the dc conductivity and the conductivity for very long
wavelengths increase on sintering. At 7u the admittance
of the gaps is so much larger that they do not inhibit
current flow; on this basis the higher conductivity at
7u as compared with that at 100u was explained above.
The removal of gaps therefore does not increase the
conductivity at 7u nearly as much as that at 100g. It has
been observed that a sample that sintered sufficiently so
that a brownish cast was observed, had at least a three-
fold increase in dc conductivity. Since the discrepancy
between the values obtained by the two measurements
reported in Table III is much less than threefold, the
amount of sintering that would account for the dc
discrepancy is not nearly enough to alter the appearance
of the sample in visible radiation. For the same reason
the measured values at 7 are not nearly as sensitive t0
sintering as those made in the wavelenegth region beyond
100x and with direct current.

listed in Table IV, and agree remarkably well with each
other and with the value 7~10~" sec reported® for bulk
metal. The agreement between the values calculated
assuming different values of the density ratio is reassur-
ing. Thus a relaxation time of electrons in gold blacks
of the same order of magnitude as that of electrons in
bulk gold can account for the wavelength dependence
of the conductivity observed for four gold black samples.
The choice of wavelengths A=345y and A=455u was
made before the theoretical analysis was performed.
In Fig. 1 these two values are seen to be so close together
for the study of relaxation times as hardly to represent
independent measurements. It is hoped that the results
presented here may stimulate further measurements in
the region 105u<\<345u in order to check the linear
dependence of the reciprocal reduced conductivity per
square on the square of the reciprocal wavelength.

CONCLUSIONS AND SUMMARY

The range of wavelengths larger than 105. appears
very useful for the investigation of the behavior of

«electrons in metal blacks and their absorptive power.

While dc conductivity measurements only give the
product of electron concentration and relaxation time,
the determination of the conductivity by optical means
at various wavelengths provides an independent means
of determining the relaxation time.

The relaxation time of electrons in blacks was found
to be of the same order of magnitude as that in bulk gold.
This would indicate that the amplitude of oscillation of
the electrons is so small that the fine state of division of
gold in a black does not hinder the response of the elec-
trons to radiation of wavelength greater than 100g.

A closed expression was derived for finding the con-
ductivity of thin films at large wavelengths in terms of
the observed transmission and absorption of any film,
whether a black deposit or a bright film. It has been
shown that the reduced conductivity per square of film
is a very fundamental property of metal films and a very
useful one because (A) it determines directly the optical
behavior of the film and at long wavelengths approaches
the absorption per unit transmission asymptotically,
(B) it is dimensionless, and (C) it can be determined
an a very accurate knowledge of the density of the

m.

The optical constants are not nearly as useful because
they are strongly dependent on the density of the black.
While it was originally thought that they had to be
determined first from optical measurements in order to
find the conductivity, it now turns out that by means of
Eq. (9) the conductivity is found much more easily than
are the optical constants.

The following conclusions can be drawn from the pres-
ent investigation about the structure of metal blacks.

a x is the ratio of the density of bulk gold to that of the gold black deposit.

As the blacks have an extremely low density and yet
conduct direct current, they probably consist of yarn-
like strands relatively far apart. The dc conductance
of metal blacks is about 10~° times that of bright
deposits of comparable weight per unit area. This
low ratio is due both to the longer conducting path in
blacks and to the lower concentration of electrons in the
blacks. This comparatively low concentration has two
causes, namely the low concentration of metal in blacks,
and the low concentration of electrons in the metal
strands.
