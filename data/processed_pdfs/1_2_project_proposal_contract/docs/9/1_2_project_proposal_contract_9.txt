"(a) As used in this clause, the following terms shall have the
meanings set forth below:

(1) The term 'Subject Invention' means any invention, improve-
ment or discovery (whether or not patentable) conceived or first actually
reduced to practice either (A) in the performance of the experimental,
developmental, or research work called for or required under this contract,
or (B) in the performance of any experimental, developmental, or research
work relating to the subject matter of this contract which was done upon
an understanding in writing that a contract would be awarded; provided,
that the term 'Subject Invention' shall not include any invention which
is specifically identified and listed in the Schedule for the purpose of
excluding it from the license granted by this clause.

(ii) The term 'Technical Personnel' means any person employed
by or working under contract with the Contractor (other than a subcontractor
whose responsibilities with respect to rights accruing to the Government
in inventions arising under subcontracts are set forth in paragraphs (g),
(nh), and (1) of this clause) who, by reason of the nature of his duties in
connection with the performance of this contract, would reasonably be
expected to make inventions.

(iii) The terms 'subcontract' and 'subcontractor' mean any
subcontract or subcontractor of the Contractor, and any lower-tier subcon=-
tract or subcontractor under this contract.

"(b) The Contractor agrees to and does hereby grant to the Govern-
ment an irrevocable, nonexclusive, nontransferable, and royalty-free license
to practice, and cause to be practiced by or for the United States Govern-
ment throughout the world, each Subject Invention in the manufacture, use
and disposition according to law, of any article or material, and in the
use of any method; provided, however, that with respect to (1) any Subject
Invention made by other than Technical Personnel, (ii) any Subject Invention
conceived prior to, but first actually reduced to practice in the course of,
any of the experimental, developmental, or research work specified in para-
graph (a) (i) above, and (iii) the practice of any Subject Invention in
foreign countries, the obligation of the Contractor to grant the aforesaid
license and the other rights hereinafter provided in this clause shall be
limited to the extent of the Contractor's right to grant the same without
incurring any obligation to pay royalties or other compensation to others


JNTRACT NUMBER: N5ori-60
AMENDMENT NUMBER: 17

solely on account of said grant. No license granted herein shall convey
any right to the Government to manufacture, have manufactured, or use any
Subject Invention for the purpose of providing services or supplies to the
general public in competition with the. Contractor or the Contractor's
commercial licensees in the licensed fields. Nothing contained in this
paragraph shall be deemed to grant any license under any invention other
than a Subject Invention.

"(c) The Contractor shall:

(i) Make a written disclosure to the Contracting Officer
_ promptly after conception or first actual reduction to practice of each
Subject Invention which reasonably appears to_be patentable;

(ii) Certify to the Contracting Officer not less often than
every twelve months, commencing with the date of this contract, whether
or not any Subject Inventions were conceived or first actually reduced to
practice during the preceding twelve months; and

(iii) Prior to final settlement of this contract, make a
summary report of all those Subject Inventions previously disclosed and
of those Subject Inventions conceived or first actually reduced to
practice after the last certification but prior to the summary report.

"(d) The Contractor shall also, in connection with each Subject
Invention referred to in paragraph (c) (i) above:

(i) Specify, at the time of making written disclosure, whether
or not a United States patent application claiming such Invention has been
or will be filed by or on behalf of the Contractor. If the Contractor
specifies that a United States patent application will be filed claiming
such Invention, the Contractor shall file or cause to be filed such applica-
tion in due form and time. If the Contractor decides not to file or cause
to be filed said application after having specified that it would file, the
Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer at the earliest practicable
date and in any event not later than eight months after first publication,
public use or sale;

(ii) In the event the Contractor specifies that it has not
filed and will not file (or having specified that it will file, thereafter
notifies the Contracting Officer to the contrary), (A) inform the Contracting
Officer in writing at the earliest practicable date of any publication of
such Invention made by or mown to the Contractor or, where applicable, of

4DMENT NUMBER: 17

eservation of a nonexclusive and royalty free license to the Contractor
(and to its existing and future associated and affiliated companies, if
any, within the corporate structure of which the Contractor is a part)
together with the right of the Contractor to grant sublicenses to existing
and future licensees, which license shall be assignable to the successor of
that part of the Contractor's business to which the Subject Invention pertains.

"(£) If the Contractor fails to deliver to the Contracting
Officer the certificates required by paragraph (c) (ii) of this clause
or fails to furnish the written disclosures for all Subject Inventions
required by paragraph (c) (i) of this clause shown to be due in accordance
with any certificate delivered under paragraph (c) (ii), there shall be
withheld from payment untill the Contractor shall have corrected such
failures either (i) ten percent (10%) of the amount of this contract, as
from time to time amended, or (ii) $5,000.00, whichever is less. After
payment of eighty percent (80%) of the amount of this contract, as from
time to time amended, payment shall be withheld until a reserve of either
(1) ten percent (10%) of such amount of (ii) $5,000.00, whichever amount
is less, shall have been set aside, such reserve or balance thereof to he
retained until the Contractor shall have furnished to the Contracting
Officer (A) the summary report required by paragraph (c) (iii) of this
clause, (B) written disclosures for all Subject Inventions required by
paragraph (¢) (i) of this clause which are shown to be due in accordance
with certificates delivered under paragraph (c¢) (ii) or in accordance
with such summary report, and (C) the information as to any subcontractor
required by paragraph (h) of this clause. The maximum amount which may
be withheld under this paragraph shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the
amount of this contract or $5,000.00, whichever is less, and no amount shall
be withheld under this paragraph when the minimum amount specified by this
paragraph is being withheld under other provisions of this contract. The
withholding of any amount or subsequent payment thereof to the Contractor
shall not be construed as a waiver of any rights accruing to the Government
under this contract. This paragraph shall not be construed as requiring
the Contractor to withhold any amounts from a subcontractor to enforce com
pliance with the patent provisions of a subcontract.

"(g) The Contractor shall exert all reasonable effort to negotiate
for the inclusion of this Patent Rights clause in any subcontract hereunder
of $3,000.00 or more having experimental, developmental, or research work
as one of its purposes. In the event of refusal by a subcontractor to
accept the Patent Rights clause, the Contractor shall not proceed with
the subcontract without written authorization of the Contracting Officer,
and upon obtaining such authorization, shall cooperate with the Govern-
ment in the negotiation with such subcontractor of an acceptable patent
rights clause; provided, however, that the Contractor shall in any event
require the subcontractor to grant to the Government patent rights under
Sub ject Inventions of no less scope and on no less favorable terms than


CONTRACT NUMEER: N5ori-60
AMENDMENT NUMBER: 17

those which the Contractor has under such subcontracts, except that in no
event shall the subcontractor be required to grant to the Government
patent rights in excess of those herein agreed to be granted to the
Government by the Contractor.

"(h) The Contractor shall, at the earliest practicable date,
notify the Contracting Officer in writing of any subcontract containing
a patent rights clause, furnish the Contracting Officer a copy of such
clause, and notify the Contracting Officer when such subcontract is
completed. It is understood that with respect to such subcontract clause,
the Government is a third party beneficiary; and the Contractor hereby
assigns to the Government all the rights that the Contractor would have
to enforce the subcontractor's obligations for the benefit of the
Government with respect to Subject Inventions. The Contractor shall not
be obligated to enforce the agreements of any subcontractor hereunder
relating to Subject Inventions.

"(1) When the Contractor shows that it has been delayed in
the performance of this contract by reason of its inability to obtain in
accordance with paragraph (g) a suitable patent rights clause from a
qualified subcontractor for any item or service required under this
contract for which the Contractor itself does not have available facilities
or qualified personnel, the Contractor's delivery dates shall be extended
for a period of time equal to the duration of such delay; and, upon
request of the Contractor, the Contracting Officer shall determine to what
extent, if any, an additional extension of the delivery dates and an
increase in contract prices based upon additional costs incurred by such
delay are proper under the circumstances; and the contract shall be modified
accordingly. If the Contractor, after exerting all reasonable effort, is
unable to obtain a qualified subco ntractor as set forth above, the Con-
tractor may submit to the Contracting Officer a written request for
waiver or modification of the requirement that a suitable patent rights
clause be included in the subcontract. Such request shall specifically
state that the Contractor has used all reasonable effort to obtain such
qualified subcontractor, and shall cite the waiver or termination provision
hereinafter set forth. If, within thirty five (35) days after the date of
receipt of such request for a waiver or modification of said requirement,
the Contracting Officer shall fail to deny in writing such request, the
requirement shall be deemed to have been waived by the Government. If
within such period the Contractor shall receive a written denial of such
request by the Contracting Officer, this contract shall thereupon
automatically terminate and the rights and obligations of the parties
shall be governed by the provisions of the clause of this contract entitled
"Termination for the Convenience of the Government.’
