Enclosed are the solutions obtained by our new Differential
Analyzer for the "Kinetic Theory" problem:

OX 2 p « 5 ¢ (1a Y
= p= (1-77)

= kx - (1-77)

For our convenienge we have let z be:

All combinetions of the values:
p=0, 1/4, 1/2, 1 x =0,1, 2
k=0, 1/2, 1 Yo = 0s 1, 2
have been used as shown in the "List of Solutions"
We have plotted X Ve U and y vse u u and tabulated x» Io L Zz, and

the same in 811 solutions and ere as shown on Fun #1, 1.08.3

 

10000t, 1000x, 1000y, 4000z, and 4000e™Y respectively.

We have checked all of the solutions for accurazy in the follow
ing ways:

and for large values of u and y:

The time of mechine use on the problem, including setting-up and
testing, was 52 hours. The total time of operators for planning, testing,

and running was 147 man-hours. 7 loys Lar,
