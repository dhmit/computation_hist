ONR Contract RSoriO6001

m——————————————————————————————————————————————————

in accordance with our conversations with the following
ONR Representatives:

Mr. Alfred J. Wise, ONR Contract Administrator, MIT
Dr. Carl F. Mukenhaupt, Chief Scientist, Boston
Dr. F Joachim Weyl, Dir. Math Sciences Div., Washington

we recommend applying to ONR for an additional $20,000 to
supplement the expenditure of Project 6345 for the fiscal period
1956-1957.

Project 6345 (WHIRLWIND Operation) has an unexpended
balance of $97,000 as of November 30, 1955. The current expenditures
are approximately $10,000 per month. The average "{ncome'' received
for Whirlwind usage is approximately $3000 per month -- a net
expenditure of $7000 per month. If it is assumed that the present
level of income ($3000 per month) is maintained during the 17-
month period December 1, 1255 to June 30, 1957, a minimum amount
of $119,000 will be required during this period.

Project 6915 (Machine Methods of Computation) has an
unexpended balance of $71,000 as of November 30, 1255. The current
expenditures are approximately $7,000 per month. If it is assumed
that the present expenditures remain constant, there will be 2a
balance of approximately $22,000 on June 30, 1936. In accordance
with our present plans for terminating the ONR support of this
project on June 30, 1936, there will be certain additional
terminating expenditures. It is estimated that $7,000 will be
expended for termination purposes.

The expected arrival of an IBM Type 704 Electronic Data
Processing Machine at MIT about January 1, 1957 will create a
definite need for additional funds to finance the conversion of
existing WHIRLWIND programs to Type 704 programs.


A separate DIC project will be set up to handle the Type 704
utilization within the M.I.T. COMPUTATION CENTER, and a
separate request for GNR funds will be made. Current plans
indicate that Project 6345, as such, will terminate on June 30, 1957.
As a matter of fact, certain experienced programmers will be
transferred to the mew project on January 1, 1957. The estimated
budget for Project 6345 has been adjusted accordingly.

The task order for Project 6345 will include the
usual Whirlwind project activites:

1. Research in methods of numerical analysis and
the formulation of scientific problems for
machine solution, together with the training
of personnel in these methods.

2. Support of the Scientific and Engineering
Applications group of Project WHIRLWIND so as
to make the computer useful and available for
the above-mentioned research.

In addition, the following task order arising in connection with
the Type 704 EDPM will be included:

3. The development of a suitable interpretive program
and associated coding techniques to permit
effective implementation of the Type 704 machine.

A detailed breakdown of the estimated budget for
Project 6345 and the 6915 termination costs are given on the
next page.
