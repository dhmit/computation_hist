Reference: Contract N50ri-06001 DIC-#6345, #6915

Under the proposed plan submitted herewith, Project
#6345 (Whirlwind Operation) would terminate on June 30, 1957.
The task order for this period would include the usuval Vhirlwind
project activitles:

1. Research in methods of numerical analysis and
the formuletion of scientific prcoblems for machine
solution, %together with the tralning of personnel
in these methods.

2. Support of the Scilentific and Engineering Appllca-
tiong Group of Project Whirlwind so as to make the
computer useful and available for the above-mentioned
regearch. .

In addition, it is proposed that the following task
order arising in connection with the Type 704 EDPM be included:

3. The development of a sultable interpretive program
and associated coding technidques to permit effective
implementation of the Type 704 machine.

It is anticipated that a separate project will be set
up to hendle the Type 704 utilization within the MIT Computation
Center, and a separate request to the ONR Tor support of thls work
will be made in the near future. In this respect certaln
experienced programmers could be made avallable for transfer %o
this new %task as of January 1, 1957. Thls anticlpated transfer
has been taken into account in the budget proposed for Project #6345.

The foregoing proposal does not take into consideration
termination costs which may be assoclated with the close out of
this contract and the possible dlsposition of the Whirlwind Computer.
It is proposed to delay the submittal of any budget for this matter
untll suech time as disposition of the Whirlwind Computer is
determined.

The estimated budget for the period July 1, 1956 to
June 30, 1957 1s attached herewlth as page 3.

Very truly yours,
