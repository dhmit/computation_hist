Dear Mr. Kataoka:
I have received your TWX of 13 April.

Dr. R. R. V. Weiderkehr and I would like to visit you on :
8 May 1961.

Mr. Armerding has told me that he has sent a T09 version of
GQS to the Operations Research Center. If possible, we would
prefer to run it in preference to the TO4 version. However, we
have no instructions on how to prepare the input data. If they

differ from the TO4 version please let us know so we can prepare
the cards here.

Will we need any authorization to use the computer?

Dr. Weiderkehr and I would like to attend Professor Brown's
lecture on "The Changing Structure of Computer Program for
Describing Complex Processes", that evening. We would appreciate
it if you would arrange for our reserved seats.

If May 8th is not convenient for you, May 5th is acceptable
to us as a substitute. This is in part dictated by the opportunity
to attend Sir Charles Percy Snow's lecture that evening.

Yours truly,
=0/ ,

R. D. MASON, JR.
