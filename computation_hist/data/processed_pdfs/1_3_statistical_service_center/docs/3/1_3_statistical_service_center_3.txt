to the transfer of the Differential Analyzer Facilities %o thiz labora-
tory and particnlarly %o the transfer of the asaocleted shop facilities
effective July 1, 1950. Past

ani We find no point of difference with your letter and accept i%
in its entirety.

I believe you have talked with Paul Cusick relative to the
transfer of the inventory to the Inetrumensetion Laboratory. We have in-
formed Paul that this transfer is acceptable to ws end have requested his
advice to the end that the transfer ean de effected in s menner acceptable
to the Government auditors. Howard Forbes, Purchasing Agent of this
laboratory, should ve kept informed of all setica in thls area.

Norn-gtaff personnel in our laboratory are under the supervision
of Robert S. Temblyn. I am referring your letter to Bod go that he can
taite the actlon necessary to got Frost, Forbes and Winther on our payroll
effective July 1, 1950.

The DIC number assigned to the Differentinl Analyzer is 6783.
The szlaries of the three shop men and all further materials required by
the shop should be charged ageinst this number. Tha game number will, of.
course, ve charged with the inventory transfer already mentioned. Thig
munber will also carry the salary of Fredrickson and the second Instrumenta~
tion Laboratory man whom we send over for training purposes.
