using computers in social science m, we will have to use a team;
a men who knows the field plus a man who mm the machine.

This last ingredient is the part which is tht out or the
contribution which ran has made to the Computation center. To put
the Center at the forefront of research, we must have a full-time
staff of enthusiastic machine specialists, to teach prospective
users has to make the machine do its tricks and to Join with re-
search workers, who come with a "gleam in their eye,“ forming
teams which can utilize to the fullest the computer's capabilities
in research. This stuff will be hard, but not impossible, to
recruit. We have the beginnings of one formed now, at present
slanted chiefly toward research in the physical sciences, and we
have obtained an NSF grant or $35,000 a year for three years to
support it. We have the graduate student bodies or the partici-
pating institutions to pick from and we have already begun to
make contact with those students who are interested in machine
utilization. There are about two dozen IBM research assistants
appointed for this year. We should be able to pick from the best
or these a few who would like to stay on for two or three years
more, after they have obtained their advanced degrees in engineering,
mathematics or science, to be a part of our research staff, potential

members of research teams.

Budget for the Social Sciences

 

To make up a staff which could handle the social science

problems as well as the physical science ones would need another
