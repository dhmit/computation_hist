SUBJECT: Continuation of Contract N5ori06001 (D.I.C. 6345 and
6915) beyond current expiration date for the pericd
1 July 1955 through 30 June 1956

REFERENCE: O.N.R. Contract N50ri06001

In accordance with conversations with O.N.R. represen-
tatives in Washington and Boston, we recommend applying to O0.N.R.
for an additional $30,000 to supplement expenditures of Projects
6345 and 6915 for 1955-1956, so they may be continued at the
agreed-on level. Project 6915 will be tapered off next year. It
probably will have about g70,000 unexpended of funds already allo-
cated and its part of the budget will be about this amount, 30 no
more is needed for this part of the work. |

Project 6345 (Wwl operation) will have an increased
pudget next year of about $160,000, caused by the considerable
inerease in the use of WWl for pure research, by groups in all
Departments of the Institute. The increased cost of this increase
in aid to research work will be borne by instituting a system of
charges for machine time to those non-0.N.R. projects at M.I.T.
which can afford to help, in accordance with a procedure which has
been approved by O.N.R. It is estimated that the "income" from
these charges will be about $60,000 next year. In addition, about
370,000 will be left unexpended, of funds already allocated to
5345, by 30 June 1955. ‘this leaves $30,000 to be requested in
new funds. The details of the combined budget for the two projects
