someone who has had.a~good3background in mathematics (a bachelor!s
or master‘s degree) and who is interested in computing machine- ‘
applications. .Thc person who comes would have a chance to take

a course or so and could go to various seminars.around the place.
If, for example, he wanted to eventually get a doctor's degre
he could work at the Center for a year or so and then take a
part-time Job while'working for his degree. .

 

We have a wide range or problems from those of language .
translation to those of calculations of nuclear characteristics.
We do not code the usual problem which comes to us, so these

ted in taking such a position either
this spring or next summer, or in suggesting that such people

should write me directly. The salary we would offer would be
normal to universities, no as high as industrial positions, but

the man would have the opportunity of further class work and would
have contact with a wider variety of problems than in industry.
