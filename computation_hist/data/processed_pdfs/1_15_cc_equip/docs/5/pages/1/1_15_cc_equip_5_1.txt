In accordance with our telephone converaatlon on Monday, by 27,

required in the ,-.-,v,-\v MIT Mutation Center in the Earl '1‘. Compton Laboratory.
This list smallness the room number, the dean-ed phone extension, the name
oi the individml, and a brie: deucription of the equipment required at each
lite. I lmov that the detailed eon-mt; on the equipment are not complete
as show; on this list; however, 1 tool 1' on better discus this with the
telephmxe people rather than trying to put it in 0. letter.

Al I informed you, at the gremnt tune in tin; Office of Statistical
Services we have a number of telephones and extenslone which are oral-zed to
the general administration account. Sonatina at your convenience I would
like to diecuee which of the telephone: on the attached list might be sini—
lnrly billed or absorbed. 0n the other bond, however, I want to ammonia:
that a umber of the people listed in this cm are at the present tile 10—-
ceted ut the Bert: Building on the lhlrlwlnd Project and the telephones which
these people are currently using are, a! course, paid for by 3 MR proJect
6345. Boat: similar arrangement will be undo for people in the Computation
center who are doing. primarily wheel-ch work. “not is, their telephones
will be paid for Six-um one of the coconuts covering such research work.

Although it is not apparent from the attached listing, l mu expec—
ting to install 3 9361118 wilt which will ollow the receptionist in the Oom—
putetion Center to select and complete cells without manual intervention.

The type or unit I am referring to is move (in telephone jargon) as circuit
3065604431 We have such a circuit in the Berta Building at the present time.
In principgﬁ this circuit will allow completion at incoming calls upon audible
indication from the reocptionlnet without need of a switch board operator.
Specially, line: 4111 - 4115 and (3 similar number ten higxer) 4121 — 4125
are used in a particular runner to effect this automatic paging action.

Again, I I“; 1 beat discuss this with the equipment installation people
rather than trying to explain it in detail in this letter.

I would very much appreciate hearing from you in case there are
any questions on this (I on sure there will be). In the meantime, I would
like you to expedite this order in order that telephone equipment my be in—
stalled as soon as possible.
