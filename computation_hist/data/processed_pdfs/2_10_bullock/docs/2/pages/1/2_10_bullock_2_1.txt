Subject: Increased Processing Speed for 7090

IBM recently announced that the internal Processing speed of the

7090 has been significantly increased. This has been achieved by
improved logical design and core Sstorage speeds. The improve -

ments are

1) The basic machine cycle time has been reduced from
2.4 microseconds to 2.18 microseconds.

2) Floating and Fixed Point Multiply and Divide operations
are executed 1/3 faster.

3) A number of instructions formerly requiring 2 cycles
are now executed in one cycle.

These improvements mean that the 7090 is now 6.3 times as fast |
as the 709. The attached Page describes these improvements in
more detail.
