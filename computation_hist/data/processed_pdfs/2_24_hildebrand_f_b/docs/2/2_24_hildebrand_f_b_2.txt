Dear Professor Martin:

In accordance with the request received from
Professor Morse, the following calculating machines have
been transferred to Room 2-263 for student use in connec-
tion with Subject M4l1.

Serial Purchase Purchase
CA No. No. Type of Mach, Date Price
Monroe CA=3 295439 10=-place 1=-9«41 $595,
Nat .Cash CA-5 542688 3000 machine 7=-1-40 $1815.25
Marchant CA«9 171131 8-place 12-442 $546,
Marchant CA-13 125558 8-~place 5«10~45 #546,
Marchant CA-14 195270 B-place 5«10«45 £546.
Marchant CA-«15 195269 g-place 5~10=45 $546,
Marchant CA-16 195292 8-place 5«10«45 $546,
$5414.25

These machines were purchased by the Center of Analysis for
use in the desk-calculator section. More recently, these
machines have been used jointly by the staff of the Numerical
Analysis Laboratory and by students in the former numerical
analysis subjects 6.531 ~- 6,534,

It is evident from the above purchase dates that
the machines are not new and have seen considerable use, I
have therefore recommended that the existing service con=-
tracts on the Marchant calculators be maintained in order
that reliable service will be available during the forth-
coming period of heavy student use. Accordingly, I have
submitted 5 invoices ($30 per year per machine) to
Miss Goodwin for payment.

Neither the Monroe or the National Cash Register
machines have been on a service contract, and repairs are
therefore obtained by calling the respective agency.
