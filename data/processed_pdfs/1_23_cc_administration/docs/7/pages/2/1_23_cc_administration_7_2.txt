In the following sections we describe the condensed symbolic
notation, the use ol the revised library system, the use of con-
densed symboifc cards with assembly, and the use of the program
which prepares the condensed library tapes and the condensed sym-—
bolic cardse

The modification TO the assembly program 1is written except
for the section of sbout 100 additional instructions which will
provide for the reading of condensed cards. The program for the
preparation of library tapes and the preparation of condensed
cards is completely written., Neither of the programs has yet bee
punched Upe.

A number of desirable features, designed TO protect against
human and machine error, nave not been incorporated in the pres—
ent system for lack of time.

The features described herein are tentative and subject TO
modification by persons willing to argue and TO program thelr

proposals.
