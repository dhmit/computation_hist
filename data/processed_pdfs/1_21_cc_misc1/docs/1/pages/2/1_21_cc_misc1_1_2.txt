Deay Frank:

The Center has received an invoice from B. L. Makepeace
for a No. 610 template at & cost of ¥1.60. On checking with
the Purchasing Office, we found that this is the last of an
order for templates amounting to a total of #15.60. The
Center has norrecord of recelving these templates, and 1t
would be appreciated if you would clarify where they are.

Tnasmuch as the amount is small and the bulk of the
order has already been paid, the Center will pay tlke
»emaining charge to avoild ereating clerical difficulties.

Sincerely,

¥F. J. Corbato
