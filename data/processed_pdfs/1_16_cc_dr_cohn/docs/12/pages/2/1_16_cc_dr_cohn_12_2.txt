STABLE LATTICES
PART II

HARVEY COHN

10. Introsiuction t(.> Part II. The most interesting cases of stable lattices
introduced in an earlier volume of this journal (12), were the (algebraic) mod-
ules of stablfz norm, or modu‘les whose ratio of minimum absolute non-zero
norm to lattlc;e determinant (1.e.., to the square root of module-discriminant)
is a local maximum for small variations of the basis. We soon found that these
modules were perhaps more numerous than we should have desired if we were
interested only in finding an absolute maximum. Nevertheless stable lattices
acquire a certain amount of intrinsic interest once we reach the stage where the
continuous variable concept of “neighborhood of a lattice” leads to algebraic
criteria of stability. In both these respects the situation displays some similarity
to the more classical subject of extremal (quadratic) forms (2).

[f the module in question is the module of all integers (i.e., the so-called
integer-module) of a totally real field of degree n, then the criterion of stability
depends on the relative signs of the conjugates of the units. This is a specializa-
tion, (weaker when n > 3), of the classical concept of ‘‘(maximum) signature
rank 2%,"" used by Weber (13) for instance. We shall merely show, as a significant
illustration, that the integer-module of the totally real field Ky = R (cos 27/N),
over the rationals R, has stable norm (except for a few small V).

If we consider fields that are not totally real, the classical problem of signature
rank becomes vacuous for the imaginary (conjugate) fields while the stability
criterion that we use becomes more complicated. We shall, however, demon-
strate a refinement of the ‘“unit star’’ method of Part I (12; p. 265), to obtain a
criterion that can be readily used to test more general modules. We shall carry
this through the cubic case.

The big difficulty arises when “too many’ roots of unity occur. We shall,
therefore, consider as a final example the integer-module of the cyclotomic
field K¥ = R(exp 2wi/N). This module turns out to have a stable norm if and
only if N is square-free. This result, which essentially uses the presence or ab-
sence of a normal basis for KV, should further attest to the algebraic aspect of
stability.

11. A totally-real illustration. If we specialize somewhat to integer-
modules of a totally real normal field K, then the criterion of stability (of the
