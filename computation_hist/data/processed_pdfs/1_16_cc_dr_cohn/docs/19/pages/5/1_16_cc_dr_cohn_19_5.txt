Here 8”,: is the Kronecker symbol, and J2m4(z) is the Bessel function of

is zero, which leads to some rather remarkable identities. We are more
directly concerned with showing that Ausé 0 if in = 6 or m 2 8, whence
none of the derivatives of ®,m(z) with respect to w are identically zero. To
see this, we need only estimate the Bessel functions occurring in (7) to Show
that, when n=k=1, the second term in the expression for AM is much
less than 8,, (=1). It is sufﬁcient, for our purposes, to know that the
exponential sum in (7) is less than c. The tedious details of the estimations

The expreSSion for G12“) in the equation (Se) is of some interest since
it is proportional to the square of form-40(2) —1)-a, which in turn
