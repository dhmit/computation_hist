Your letter of September 25th to Professor Morse has
been forwarded to me. The movie to which you refer is our
MAKING ELECTRONS COUNT, Ue have several prints which we send
out on request for a week or two at a time.

 

; The enclosed form describes the film and explains the
procedure for borrowing it. If you will kindly complete and
return one copy of the form, we shall arrange to send the
movie to you.
