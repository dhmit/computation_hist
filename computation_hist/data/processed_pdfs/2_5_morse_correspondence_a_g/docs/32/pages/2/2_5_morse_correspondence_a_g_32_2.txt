End of first paragraph. Not valid to say "more useful
in control system'. All scientific calculations useful.

Under 'key principle (2)'. Should follow up speed
description by reason: so that we can do very complex
problems in a finite time.

Under Bl. Not freedom from error but replacing random
by systematic errors which are easier to find and remove.

Answer to question at end of first paragraph. Probably
need a full sketch of modern computeﬁs at beginning,

with repeated emphasis 0? Important aspects at pertinent
points.

Under 3. Doubt that too much computer work will be done.

At the moment the major hurdle is getting social scientists
to reallx find out what machines are and can do by practical
experience. Then will come the good, new ideas.

Paragraph 2. Grosch is wrong. The M.I.T. approach and
Forrester's is best for the initial educational break-
through. (By the way, Forrester is no longer at Lincoln.
He is now at M.I.T.'s School of Industrial Management, as
a Professor.)
