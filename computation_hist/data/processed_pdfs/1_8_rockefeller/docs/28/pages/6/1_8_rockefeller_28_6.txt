of the proposed schemes ahould be tried out, and others developed,
by'mnubera of the Center staff working with persons familiar with
the information and its uses. For example,a project in machine

Professor Locke of the Language Depart-nnt. An 1t dcvelops, it

need the use of a machine to test its ideas. The translation
proJoct la already supported by the Rockefeller Foundation, but
parallel ‘work by the Computation Center on techniques for rapid
aceess to large-quantity data would help this work as well as
others. Another promising direction of investigation is in the
application of machine techniques to library inventorying,
cataloguing, and record-keeping. Although special-purpose
machines will probably be required in the end, many ideas and
procedures can be developed and checked out on the general-
purpose machine at the Center with the addition, perhaps, of some
speclially built input and output equipment. The staff of the
MIT Library 1s interested in this work and will contribute its
knowledge to 1ts progress.

C. Perhaps the most promising line of advance, in part
because the least investigated up till now, is in the field of
social science experiments, where the computer can be used as
recorder, scorer and referce. Tactical situations in warfare are
already being studlied by "gaming techniques" at Rand and in other
military operations research groups. Similar problems in vavpious

flelds of the social sciences can also be studied by simplifying
