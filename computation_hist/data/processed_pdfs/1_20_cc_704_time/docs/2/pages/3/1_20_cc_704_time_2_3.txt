Subject: Appml or Requests tor computation Tine at the Center

 

1. The Center has set up the rule that all research workers,
teculty or students. who wish to use the equipment of the Center in the
oourse of their renal-ch. lust apply tor approval or their computing plans
Illd for assignment of. machine tile, using the tomscnclosed. Machine time
for unclassified research, connected with graduate education. is free, but
we need the tomlisl or an application so as to have the chance to look
over computation plons before they are started, to see whether they are
feasible and to see whether we con allocate the required time. (Ho classified
work 1111 be done at the Center.)

2. The Center is asking that each Department Head approve each such
application which involves either teculty- where or students in his department,
before the application comes to us. We feel this added requirement is desirable
because: ‘

 

1. It gives you a chance to see what use your department is
making of the center (you may wish to Keep a record of the toms you
have 0rd.)

2. It gives us the benefit of your Judgement of the value of
the proposed research to the educational activities carried on by
MIT. We do not ask you to Judge the feasibility of putting the
problem on a computing machine (we will do that); we do ask that
you approve only those requests which represent useful research in
the field of your department and which contribute non-trivially to
the education or one or more students.

3. We do not ask that you approve requests for machine time
from non projects. involving only DSR staff nowhere in the prosecution
of the research 0! their project. Such purely project computation,
usually of a more routine nature, will have lower priority in machine
time assignments, will be expected to contribute financially to the
support of the Center, if time is assigned, and arrangements for
this work will be discussed between the center and the Project
Supervisor directly. without needing to bother you, In any case, the
work must be publiehahle.

 

4. To approve an application, you should sign in the box on the
right—hand column, marked "Inst. Rep. Approval", circled in red in the enclosed
sample. We will not accept an application without such a signature:

5. If you have any questions about these procedures please call or
see me or Frank Verzuh.
