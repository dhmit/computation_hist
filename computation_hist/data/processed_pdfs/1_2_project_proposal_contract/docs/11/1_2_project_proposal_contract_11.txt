Dear air:

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology submits
herewith a'revised proposal for extension of the reference contract
to June 30, 1957 at an additional estimated cost of $20,960.00.

We understand that this proposal has been the subject of discus—
sions between Professor P. M. Morse of MIT and hr. A. J. ties

of ONE—MIT, Dr. Carl F. Nukenhsupt of ONRpBoston, and Dr. F. J.
Weyl of ONRuWashington.

There follows a sﬁmmary of expenditures and funds
remaining on the two projects, Whirlwind Operation and Machine
Methods of Computation, which are currently active under the
reference contract:

Project #62uﬁ (Whirlwind Operation) has an unexpended
balance of $97,000 as or November 30, 1955. The current expend—
itures are approximately $10,000 per month. The'avarage “income"
received for Whirlwind usage is approximately $3,000 per month —-
a net expenditure of $7,000'psr month. If it is assumed that the
present level of income ($3.000 per month) is maintained during
the nineteen—month period December 1, 1955'to June 30, 1957, a
minimum amount” assuming some tapering off, of $119,000 will be
required during this periodn

However, for the purpose of establishin an estimate or
unexpended funds on this project as of June 30, 195 . it is esti-
mated that a higher level of income will exist during the remaining
seven months. This may sverage'something above $b,000 a month. On
this basis we estimate that $57,000 or the $97,000 mentioned above
will remain unexpended as of June 30, 1956. An additional factor
affecting the budget shown on page 4 is the eStimsted Computer
Income for the oneoyear period ending June 30, 1957. For this period
only $18,000 in Computer Income has been estimated. This is in—
fluenced by two factors: one being an expected tapering-off of the
use of the Whirlwind machine by other projects, and secondly the
expected beginning of operations under the IBM Type 704 machine.

Project #6 1 (Machine Methods of computation) has an
unexpended balance of ,000 as cf November 30, 1955. The current
expenditures are approximately $7,000 per month. If it is assumed
that the present expenditures remain constant, there will be a balance
of approximately $22,000 on June 30, 1956. In accordance with our
present'plans'for terminating the ONE support of this project on
June 30, 1956, there will be certain additional costs extimated at
$7,000 associated with the closing out of this project including such

items as the preparation of summary reports on the program of
Machine Methods of computation.

This summary is based on estimates prepared by Prof—
essor P. M. Morseo

tional funds~—to finance the conversion of existing Whirlwind
programs to Type 704 programs.

1. Research in methods of numerical analysis and
the formulation of scientific problems for machine

solution, together with the training or personnel
in these methods.

It is anticipated that a separate project will be set
up to handle the Type 70@ utilization within the MIT Computation
Center, and a separate request to the ONR for support of this work
will be made in the near future. In this respect certain
experienced programmers could be made available for transfer to
this new task as of January 1, 1957. This anticipated transfer
has been taken into account in the budget proposed for Project #6314150

The foregoing proposal does not * e into consideration
termination costs which may be associated xi 1 the close out of
this contract end the poesible disposition of the Whirlwind Computer.
It is proposed to delay the submittal of any budget for this matter

until such time as disposition of the Whirlwind Computer is
determiner?!o
