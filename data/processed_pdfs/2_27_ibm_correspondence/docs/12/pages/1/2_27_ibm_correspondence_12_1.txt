Dear Dr. Stratton:

It is with a great deal of pleasure that I enclose our check
for $14, 857. 50 representing the first semester portion of the stipends
for the IBM Research Assistants recently appointed for the 1959-60
school year in connection with the M.I.T. Computation Center. A
detailed description of the appointments is attached.

The increasing use of the IBM 704 Computer at M.1.T. by
the New England colleges both a= an educational device and a research
tool has been very encouraging to IBM, and we are delighted that

M.I.T. is having an active part in it as represented by these research
appointments. :

Sincerely your

M. Loren Bullock
