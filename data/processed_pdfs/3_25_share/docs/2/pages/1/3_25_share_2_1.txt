Dear Walter:

In response to your call of July 2lst, I have the following
comments from M.I.,T, concerning the agenda for the next SHARE meeting,
Not all of these ideas are equally valid, nor do some of them merit
any further consideration, However, I'll put them down just so the
Executive Board may be able to see & better approach to another topic
for the agenda,

 

It isn't clear to me 'hesher everyone realizes how to use in

an ordinary way the undor—overtlo;/\ﬁq after it is installed in the 704,

In particular, there are two cases, that of Fortran and that of SAP,

On one hand, this seems pretty trivial; on the other hand, people are

continuing to do rather foolish things, gHow about some wise sage (such

as Walter Ramshaw) getting up and discussing in a philosophical way the
| usually unmentionable subject of errors - in particular, machine, coding,
! and formulation, I find in personal discussions that people have their
nose so close to one type of problem that they have never considered the
larger question that all computing ventures represent a calculated risk,
Therefore, the sophisticated user knows of a whole sequence of precaufion-
ary steps which may be taken, although he only uses as many as he feels
the importance of the approach warrants, The extreme solution is when
the Russians and the Americans do the same job simultanecusly,

 

Another topic which might be a2 forum or one or two individuals,
but which would require preparation on the part of the participants, is,
How does one teach a beginning programmer to use the 709 computer im all
of its glory? Obviously, one can teach the 704 first and them suggest
that there are a few more things one can do on the 709, but this isn't
very helpful, 8Specific items that come to mind are, Does one try to
teach a subset of instructions and operational procedures and, if so,
along what lines? and finally, Would D, McCracken be a good man to have
as an invited speaker?
