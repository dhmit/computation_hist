generation of reienrch.uorkerl. But if we want to get started
using computers in social science now, we will have to use a team;
a man who knows the field plus a man who knows the machine.
Need for a Research Staff in Machine Utilization, an Ingredient

This last ingredient is the part which is feft out of the
contribution which IBM has made to the Canutatiqn c;nter. To put
the Center at the forefront of research, we must have a full-time
staff of enthusiastic machine specialists, to teach prospective
users how to make the machine do its tricks and to join with re-
search workers, who come with a "gleam in their eye," forming
teams which can utilize to th@ fullest the computer's capabilities
in research. This staff will be hard, but not impossible, to
recruit. We have the beginnings of one formed now, at present
slanted chiefly toward research in th√© physical sciences, and we
have obtained an NSF grant of 35,000 a year for three years to
support it. We have the graduate student bodies of the particil-
pating institutions to pick from and we have already begun to
make contact with those students who are interested in machine
utilization. There are about two dozen IBM research assistants
appointed for this year. We should be able to pick from the best
of these a few who would like to stay on for two or three years
more, after they have obtained their advanced degrees in engineering,
mathematics or sclence, to be a part of our research staff, potentlal
members of research teams.

Budget for the Social Scilences

To make up a staff which could handle the soclal sclence

problems as well as the physical science ones would need another
