the fox-nation of teams for the pursuit of the suggested research and
to advise on relative priorities; if end when there is more work

The attached enclosures give details of the mulpment to
lhfbe installed in the Computation Center by February or March 1957,
and the arrangements with other colleges in New England. The
suggested budget, for three years, is tentative and is more
dependent on our ability to hire one or two more experts in
computer programming than on the amount of work to be done. If
we can find more men of the right sort, more work can be done.
During the calendar year 1957 we may not be able to find here
than one senior man, one or two postâ€”doctoral fellows and a couple
of technical assistants. By the fall of 1957 we may be able to
persuade one or two faculty members of the cooperating institutions
to spend appreciable fractions of their time at the Center, work?
ing on some of the problems mentioned earlier. A suitable fraction
of their salaries should be carried by the research funds of the
Center and, if the work is in the social sciences, would be charge-
able to the proposed grant. Some of the experiments in "gaming"
will require special input orzgggput equipment. Therefore. it may
turn out that less than $35,000 will be spent the first year; more
than $35,000 the second. The important point, however, is that be-

cause of the presence of the equipment of the Center, supported by
