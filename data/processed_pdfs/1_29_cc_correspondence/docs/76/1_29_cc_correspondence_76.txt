PREFACE

The following memorandum is an edited and abbreviated version of
a Preliminary 709 Monitor Manual (May, 1960) written at IBM. The IF'ORTRAN-FAF
Monitor System consists of three basic programs: a Monitor, a Compiler,
and an Assembler. The function of the Monitor is to coordinate compiler
and assembler processing and to simultaneously provide means for initiating
execution of object subprograms. Thus, continuous machine operation is
possible regardless of what combinations of source and object subprograms

the Monitor encounters.

The control cards of the FORTRAN-FAP Monitor System allow one in

a single run with the computer to:

1. Compile several FORTRAN subprograms and punch relocatable
binary decks for them;

2. Assemble several FAP subprograms and punch relocatable binary
decks that are compatible with the FORTRAN binary subprograms;

3. Run the resulting collection of subprograms from (1) and (2)
and previously compiled decks as a single program in the
computer,

4. Or alternatively run the program as consecutive ''chain' links

of a program otherwise too large to fit in memory;

Use of the Monitor system allows the Center to batch Jobs on a
single input tape; thus on-line card reading is replaced by the faster
tape input and the inter-job time is reduced to tape manipulation by
the Monitor. Thus, the Monitor is a supervisory program for FORTRAN,
FAP, and object subprograms. The Monitor calls in the various pro-
cessing programs as needed; it is only necessary to inform the Monitor
what type of processing is to be expected. This memorandum describes

the control cards necessary for Monitor operations.


PART I. PROGRAMMING NOTES

 

 

1: INTRODUCTION

The FORTRAN-FAP Lionitor for the 709 is an extension of the 709 FORTRAN
system and can do more than compile and assemble. It permits the

following operations:

1. FORTRAN compiling.

2 FAP (FORTRAN Assembly Program) assembling.

3. Execution of object programs.

4 Execution of programs in links—a procedure necessary
where the total program is too large to fit into storage
and a link is a section of it which does fit into

storage.

Input to the lonitor System consists not only of FORTRAN subprograms

but may include the following as well:

1 Monitor control cards.

2 FAP symbolic subprograms.

3. Object subprogramnm binary cards.
4

. Data cards.

The relative order of a series of different types of input (exclusive
of data cards) does not matter provided that each separate deck, whether
source program, object program, etc., is preceded by the appropriate

control cards.

The FORTRAN compiler proper may be considercd a subsection of the
Monitor. Under FORTRAN control, a single source subprogram may be
compiled. Nothing further, including execution, can be done. If
multiple-compilation of a series of FORTRAN source programs is desired,

Monitor control is required.

DEFINITION OF JCB

A job may be considered as the basic unit being processed by the
Monitor at any one time; it consists of one or more subprograms.
A job is either an Execute or non-execute job. An Execute job
is one to be executed immediately after whatever processing is
required; thus, the subprograms of the job are related to each
other. A non-execute job contains subprograms that need not be
dependent. Each program is processed as the control cards for
the job specify. The ''processing' that is given a subprogram

is one of the following:

EXECUTE Job Non-Execute Job
1. FORTRAN Compilation 1. FORTRAN Compilation
2. FAP Assembly 2. TAP Assembly
3. Relocation of object (object program input

program input is simply ignored)
oo

 

4, For jobs divided into
links, treatments of
chain links

A job may be considered as falling into one of the following

five types:

1. One or more FORTRAN source subprograms to be compiled.
This is simply multiple-compilation.

2. One or more I'AP symbolic subprograms to be assembled.

3. An intermixture of job types 1 and 2. This results in
multiple compilation and assembly of FORTRAN and FAP
source subprograms producing object subprogram output
for each source subprogram input. There may be any

combination of main programs and subprograms.

Execute Jobs

4. A sequence of input subprograms for immediate execution.


The input subprograms may be FORTRAN subprograms, FAP
subprograms, or binary object subprograms. Data cards,
to be used during execution, follow the input sub-
programs. The input program consists of a single main
program-subprogram sequence not larger than the available
core storage and constitutes a "machine-load'.

A sequence of input programs meant for execution where
each input program is a job of type 4. The data cards
are placed at the end of all the input programs. This
is called a CHAIN job and each of the jobs of type 4
is a CHAIN LINK. This permits a single object program

execution to consist of more than one "machine-load''.

111. MONITOR FEATURES

The first record of each job must be an identification
(I. D.) card whose format is specified by each com-
puter installation.

There is a complete set of control cards for the Monitor.
These are distinguished by an asterisk (*k) in column
one. In general, they are of two types: 1) to govern
the job as a whole, telling what it consists of, and

2) to govern options in the output.

The FORTRAN Monitor System uses eight tapes on two
channels. These are Al, A2, A3, A4, Bl, B2, B3, B4.

A2 is the input tape and A3 is the output tape. Jt
should be noted that the correspondence between logical
tape designations used in FORTRAN Source program in-
put/output statements and the actual tape assignments
at object time is set in the Unit table (IOU) in the
FORTRAN library. Each installation may alter the
logical correspondences.

FORTRAN programs written for use under Monitor control
will be the same as conventional FORTRAN programs with

three exceptions.

tee


IV.

1.

a. The instructions for reading input tape and writing
output tape must refer to tapes A2 and A3 by their
respective logical tape numbers.

b. The STOP and PAUSE statements should not be used.
Programs must be terminated by a CALL EXIT or CALL
DUMP statement, or by a READ INPUT TAPE statement
when there is no more input data.

c. The END card program option controls may be replaced
by Monitor control cards. The END card itself is

still necessary.

Monitor control card information and diagnostic information,

are printed off-line as well as on-line,

THE CHAIN JOB

In the Chain job, one program, too large to fit into core
storage, is executed as a sequence of smaller programs,
Each smaller program, called a link, consists of a main
program together with all its subprograms and constitutes
a ''machine-load".

For execution, the links are stacked on any of three pos-
sible tapes. The first link in the input deck is called
in first for execution by the Monitor executive routine.
The other links are executed as they are called by the
link being executed.

There are two requirements for distinguishing individual
links: a) the start of each link must be distinguished
when preparing the input deck, and b) each link must make
provision for calling the following link during execution

of the chain job.

a. The control card CHAIN (R,T) must precede the physically
first program (or subprogram) of each chain link, re-
gardless of whether the link is composed of source or

object programs. In the card CHAIN (R,T), T specifies


the tape on which the chain link is to be kept at

execution time. T must be literally either Bl, B2

or B3 and not the corresponding logical tape numbers.
R is a fixed point number greater than O but less

than 32768 denoting a label for that link, identifying
it when it is called. (NOTE: The designations Bl,
B2, B3 must be observed in tape input-output state-
ments only. The sequence in which links are stored
for any one link tape is in no way determined by the
number, R. The sequence follows from the relative

position in the input deck.)

b. The last executable statement of a link which is to
call a succeeding link for execution must be of the

form,

CALL CHAIN (R,T).

(Here T must be a logical tape number corresponding
to Bl, B2 or B3.)
This will then cause the link, which at compilation

time had been specified by the control card,
CHAIN (R,T)

to be read into cores and executed.
Selection of Tapes for Link Stacking.
Chain links may be stacked on tapes Bl, B2, B3 for object
time execution. The selection of tapes may be a function
of object time needs to minimize tape reading time. For
example, if it is desired to execute the links once only

and in succession, they may be placed in that order on one

tape. If one of these links, however, is to be executed

5m


repeatedly while the others are executed once only, then
it should be on a separate tape to minimize tape backspace
and search time. If one tape only is desired for chain
links, we suggest it be Bl, since all links go onto Bl

first as a result of Monitor processing.

4, Programming for Chain Problems.

a. Data and Common. Data may be passed from one link to
another by means of COMMON. Therefore, when it is
intended that data be used by the programs of two or
more links, the appropriate COMMON and EQUIVALENCE
statements must be written. If a link, A, in cores
is overwritten by the next link in sequence, the next
time link A is read in for execution, it will be in
the same form it was before its first execution. This
means that any program modification or storage of non-
COMMON data resulting from the first execution will
not exist for the second execution. In this connection,
it should be mentioned that FORTRAN compiled programs

do not cause program modifications.

 

b. Relative Constants. (For a description of this term,
see 709 FORTRAN Reference Manual.) As in the case of
main programs and subprograms within a link, relative
constant values may be passed on from one link to
another merely by placing them in COMMON. This means
that if I is used as a subscript in one link and its
value is defined in another, the appropriate COMMON
entries will assure the proper subscript values at

the time the subscript is used.

V. MONITOR CONTROL CARDS

All Monitor control cards must have an "*'" in column 1. With the
exception of the I. D. card, the specific control instruction of
the card is punched in columns 7-72. Punching may be done accord-

ing to normal FORTRAN rules, which means that blanks are ignored.

1. Governing the Job as a Whole; Type 1 Control Cards.

a. I. D. Card. This card must always be the first card of
any job. It may have anything in columns 2-72 that the
installation's Sign-On Record is prepared to process.

b. XEQ. This card must follow the I. D. card of a job which
is to be executed.

c. DATA. This card must be placed at the end of the physically
last program of a job to be executed, preceding the data,
if any, for that job. It is not needed for non-execution
jobs.

d. CHAIN (R,T). This card is used to separate links within
a single Chain job, by specifying the tape on which the
link object program is to be stored for execution. It
must precede the physically first program (or subprogram)
of each chain link, regardless of whether the program is
a source or object program. R is a fixed point number
greater than O but less than 32768 denoting an identifying
label for the tape record which contains the link. Thus
R is the record indicator on a tape designated by T literally

either Bl, B2, or B3, (hot the logical tape units).

2. Governing Compilation of Individual Programs; Type 2 Control Cards.
The END statement for programs to be compiled by the Monitor need
not have options specified following the word END. It should be
only

END.
If no specifications are given in the END statement or in Monitor
Control Cards for a FORTRAN compilation, a standard output is

produced.


This consists of the following:

a. The output tape, A3, contains the information which
comprises the first two files of a compilation in the
single compile mode; that is, the source program and the
map of object program storage.

b. The object program in relocatable binary is stacked on
tape B4 for peripheral punching without the required

library subroutines.

The different Monitor control cards and their effects are:

a. CARDS ROW. (Not recommended.) This card instructs the
Monitor to punch on-line standard FORTRAN relocatable
row binary cards, preceded by a BSS loader if a main

program.

b. CARDS COLUMN. (Not recommended for normal use.) This
card instructs the Monitor to punch on-line columnar
binary relocatable cards (no loader), and do not stack

binary output on tape B4 for peripheral punching.

Note that CARDS ROW and CARDS COLUMN cannot be used with

the same source programs.

C. LIST. This card instructs the Monitor to list on the
output tape following the core storage map, the object
program in FAP-type language.

d. LIBE. (Not recommended for normal use.) This card in-
structs the Monitor to search the FORTRAN library for
subroutines during compilation of each subprogram and
include these with the object subprogram. This control
card is normally not recommended inasmuch as, when
compiling several subprograms, multiple copies of library
subroutines may be punched. Moreover, during a compile-
and-execute job the loader of the object program auto-

matically searches the library for missing subprograms.


VI.

 

3. Other Control Cards

a. There is another Monitor Control Card, FAP.
FAP. This card is placed immediately before the FAP
symbolic cards that are input to the Monitor. It specifies
that those cards are to be FAP assembled. The FAP card
follows any Type 2 Monitor control cards that may be
used.

b. Other cards, not strictly control cards, may be input to
the Moni tor.
cards with an asterisk in column 1 may be included with
the control cards, but their information field will be
treated in the manner of comments. They will be printed

on-line at the point where they are read.

PROGRAMMING FORTRAN PROBLEMS FOR THE MONITOR.

This section deals with programming in the FORTRAN language.
However, the same requirements, as reflected in machine language,
apply to FAP assembly programs as well, and to input object

programs resulting from a previous symbolic assembly program.

In general, all ordinary FORTRAN problems may be used with the
Monitor. There are, however, three relatively minor ways in

which Monitor FORTRAN programs must differ.
1. Differences Concerning Tape Usage:

a. BCD Tape. (1) All input BCD data must be called by
the statement READ INPUT TAPE 4 , n, LIST. Output
is effected by a WRITE OUTPUT TAPE A, n, LIST state-
ment, where ¢ and (J are the proper logical tape
designations for tapes A2 (input) and A3 (output),
respectively. (2) If BCD information is to be written
for intermediate storage during program execution, a
tape not used by the Monitor must be used (or one the

programmer knows the Monitor is not using).

=] 0=


b. Binary Information. READ TAPE and WRITE TAPE state-
ments must address tapes outside those used by the
Monitor system. However, when the programmer knows
the complete disposition of the various tapes used
during Monitor operation, those tapes not being used
may also be addressed. For example, if a binary tape
is wanted for intermediate storage during execution
of the program, a Monitor tape may be available for

that particular object program run.
Differences Concerning End of Program.

End of Execution. The statements that stop the machine
(STOP and PAUSE) should not be used. Instead, the last
executable source program statement must be one of the

following:

a. CALL EXIT. This statement causes immediate
termination of the job. The Monitor is restored
to core memory and control goes on to process the
next job.

b. CALL DUMP a, By PF ,---A 5D F)

where A and B x Blais NTs nomad indicating
limits of core storage to be dumped. Either Ag
or B, may represent upper or lower limits. F,
is a fixed point number indicating the format

desired, as

F—=110 dump in octal
=] dump in floating point
= 2 interpret decrement as decimal
integer
= 3 octal with mnemonics

The core dump is effected as specified, the Monitor

is restored to core memory, and control is transferred

oy


to initiate the next job. If no arguments are

given, all of core storage is dumped in octal—

this feature should not be used normally. The

last format indication may be omitted, in which

case it will be assumed to be octal.

Example:

22

Consider the FORTRAN Source Program

DIMENSION A(100), €(100), B(100), N(100)

COMMON B

DO 22 I=1, 100

A(I) = FLOATF (1)

BI) = ACT)

NCI) == 1

C(I) == "N(1)

CALL DUMP (?)

END

(1) To dump the array A in floating point,

(2)

(3)

the CALL DUMP statement would be

CALL DUMP (A,A(100),1)

To dump both the A and N arrays,

CALL DUMP (A,A(100),1,N,N(100),0)

To dump in octal with mnemonics from

absolute location 100 to the array N

10
but not including the array N, another

statement is required:

I, = XLOCF(N) - 100
CALL DUMP (N(L),N(101),3)

The use of this procedure, since it in-

volves an absolute location, is not

=] De


recommended. The library function
XIOCF(N) simply returns the location
Of N to the accumulator as a fixed

point constant.

¢. CALL CHAIN (R,T). This statement can be used only
as the last executable statement of a chain link.
It calls the next chain link into core storage to
be executed. Thus, each link or JOb runs to its
conclusion without stopping and progresses to the

next link or job without operator intervention.

d. READ INPUT TAPE. This statement terminates exe-
cution if all data on the input tape has been pre-
viously read. Thus, a programmer may utilize the
technique of continuously reiterating reading and

processing data until all the data is exhausted.
3. Use of END Statement.

The END statement may be used without any of the indicated
sense switch settings following it. Thus, END, which must
be the physically last statement of every FORTRAN source

program, may appear in either of the two following forms:

END
b. END (IX.,1 I 1 »I_), where I may have the value,
3 rT 5oT, 02D, ad
0, 1, or 2,

If END statement (a) is used, indicators for the
actual sense switch options will be inserted by
the Monitor. There are two possibilities with

respect to each option indicator.

(1) No Monitor control card is present. The

Setting prescribed by "standard" FORTRAN

ll 3m


VII.

output (see page 9 ) is inserted. Where 1, =2,
FORTRAN is instructed to interrogate the actual
sense switch setting. Physical sense switch
settings, however, are not available under
Monitor control. The setting of 2, therefore,
will instruct the Monitor to make its setting
represent that given on the control card or

by the standard setting, as above.

(2) A Monitor control card for the indicator pre-
cedes the program. In this case, the setting

prescribed by this card is inserted.
Dumping During Execution.

The following statement may be used anywhere in the source

program. CALL PDUMP (A, B., F. ..., A,B, F ) where the
1 1 1 n n n

maximum n is 20. The argument format for A, B, and F are

the same as those given for the CALL DUMP statement.

The difference between PDUMP and DUMP is that, after PDUMP
is executed, the machine is restored to its condition upon
entry, and control is returned to the next executable
statement. The core dumps appear with any other output

from the job on Tape A3.

PDUMP is a primary name appearing on the program card of

the library subprogram, DUMP.

Restriction on use of PDUMP. Do not use the CALL PDUMP

statement when there is a chain link on tape B2 to be
executed subsequently. Tape B2 is used by the PDUMP
program for intermediate storage of the contents of core

storage where PDUMP is loaded.

GENERAL RULES

Moni tor Operations.

Ze


ud}
Teng

 

Although when under Moni tor control, a FORTRAN compilation,

if desired, will produce row binary cards, the only cards

acceptable for Monitor execution are columnar binary. All

non-Monitor, hand-coded subprograms to be used must have

correct associated program cards in proper columnar binary

form.

Program Limitations.

a. Care must be exercised on jobs involving both compilation

or assembly and execution to avoid overlapping of program

and common data. Overlapping
is permitted. If common data
will be bypassed.

b. A list of missing subroutines
or the chain links of a job.
a diagnostic print-out occurs

the chain bypassed if a chain

of program and BSS control

overlap occurs, the job

is accumulated during a job,
If more than 50 are missing,
and the job is deleted, or

of transfer vectors that all levels may have in a single

job or chain link is 250.

INPUT

 

OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS

1. Job Input Decks

The IBM 709 FORTRAN Monitor will process the following types

of job-input:

Multiple Compilation/Assembling. Input will consist of
a number of FORTRAN or FAP source decks. These are to
be compiled or assembled only. The input deck for each

such job will contain, in the order listed:

1.D. Card
Source deck, » preceded by control cards governing
output, if any

Source deck, preceded etc....

Source deck

) ere

END-OF-FILE card if input from on-line cards

Compilation/Assembling and Execution. Input will consist

of one main program and all its subprograms to be compiled
and executed together with the data. These programs may

be a mixture of FORTRAN or FAP source subprograms and
machine-language object subprograms. The object subprograms
may be relocatable columnar binary output from either a
previous FORTRAN compilation (with the Transfer card, if
any, removed), or from a FAP assembly, or from other hand-
coded subroutines for FORTRAN. The input deck for a job

of this type will contain in the order listed:

I1.D. Card
XEQ Card
Object program or Source program, , preceded by any

relevant output option control cards

-16-


Object program or Source, . ..
Object program or Source
DATA Card

Data deck, if any

END-OF-FILE card if input from cards on-line

Chain Job. Input to a chain job consists of the Chain
link decks to be compiled and executed together with their
data decks. The chain link deck contains a main program
together with all its subprograms, where any or all of
these may be source or object decks. The Link deck then,

in the order listed, contains:

CHAIN (R,T) for this particular link
Object program or Source program, , preceded by
relevant output option control cards
Object program or Source,,...as above
Object program or Source
The input deck to a Chain job in the order listed, contains:
I1.D. Card
XEQ Card
Link deck, see contents listed above

Link deck,

Link deck

DATA Card

Data decks, if any

END-OF~-FILE Card if input from cards on-line.

There is no restriction on ordering of the Link decks in
the Chain deck, but it is most economical of execution
time if links are stacked in the order in which they are

called.

Since the Monitor checks the type of cards and ''looks for"

 

i]


the various control cards, source decks (with or without data)
and object subprograms may be intermixed in the same job-file.
The different types of job-files may be intermixed on the same

input tape.
1X1. DIAGNOSTICS
FORTRAN compiler diagnostics are indicated by messages on the on-
line printer. The Monitor has its own diagnostics, independent
of the FORTRAN diagnostic system. On-line operator options for

machine error stops, however, are given in the same way.

11. STOPS

 

50g 1-CS stop. Bad library tape or check sum, Depress
the Start Key to try again.

417 Card-to-tape Simulator stops. Stops with HPR 7777g
in storage register. Illegal card character code.

4214 Stops with HPR 777774 in storage register. Redundancy

 

error in writing tape. For the stop at either 417g

or 421g to re-write the bad record, empty the card

reader hopper, and feed out all cards in the card

 

reader (followed by the remainder of the deck) in
the hopper; ready the card reader, and depress the
Start Key.

25g Stop at object time. Redundancy tape check while
reading a chain link at object time. Five attempts
have been made. Location 23g will have tape number

in the address.
