4. Commutator

W e first perform an integral unimodular similarity transformation so that one
( f'athnal).vert(?g of the quadrilateral fundamental domain goes to «, with oppo-
site §1des identified by the matrices A and B, as in Figure 1. Hence labelling all
vertices, we find
(4.1) wll < wBA — wAll < w/i.
Th}lS w is a fixed-point of the commutator B7'A7'BA, and from the restriction
to integers in §3 (above) we write tentatively

(4.2 B—1A~1B“ e :tl ,\', =t

for some integer & and some choice of + sign. We immediately see that only the
manus sign can occur: For we write out the lower left-hand elements of the

matrix equation
BA = ABL

and we obtain
(4.3) (bnan + baan) = F(anby + anby,)
according to the sign in L. On the other hand, from Figure 1,

We shall later see that &k must be +6, (except in Part I1I).

b. Change of generators

To gain more information about the representation of G, we select the simplest
possible generators. It is more convenient at times to use a triple of generators,
(A, B, C], where A and B are the previously mentioned pair and C is defined by

the first of the following relations:

i ABC = E, S o ol > S <1 0)
0.1 {(.‘BA K ‘(0 L s LG )

Formally speaking, the same relations (5.1) would be satisfied (identically)
