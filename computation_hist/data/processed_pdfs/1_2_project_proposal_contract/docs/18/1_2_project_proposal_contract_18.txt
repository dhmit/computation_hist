Reference: Contract N50ri-06001

Dear Sir;

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology submits
herewith a proposal for extension of the reference contract to
June 30v 1957 at an additional estimated cost of $20,960.00.
we understand that this proposel has been the subject of discus—
sions between Professor P. M. Morse of MIT and Mr. A. J» Wise
of ONRmnIT, Dr. Carl F. Mukenheupt of OﬂﬂuBoston, and Dr. F; J.
Weyl of ONRmWoshington.

There follows a summary of expenditures and funds
remaining on the two projects, Whirlwind Operation and Machine
Methods of Computation, which are currently active under the
reference contract:

Project #6145 (Whirlwind Operation) has an unexpended
balance of $97,000 as of November 30, 1955. The current expend—
itures are approximately $10,000 per month. The average “income“
received for Whirlwind usage is approximately $3,000 per month —-
a net expenditure of $7.000 per month. If it is assumed that the
present level of income ($3g000 per month) is maintained during
the nineteen—month period December 1, 1955 to June 30, 1957, a
minimum nmountE assuming some tapering off, of $ll9,000 will be
required during this periodo

Project #6 1' (Machine Methods of Computation) hes an
unexpended balance of .71,000 as of November 30, 1955. The current
expenditures are approximately $7,000 per month. If it assumed
that the present expenditures remain constant, there will be a
balance of approximately $22,000 on June 30, 1956. In accordance
with our present plans for terminating the ONE support of this
project on June 30, 19560 there will be certain additional term—
inating expenditures. It is estimated that $7,000 will be
expended for termination pnrposes.

This summary is based on estimates prepared by Prof—
essor P. M" Morse.

Professor Morse further advises that the expected
arrival of an IBM Type 704 Electronic Data Processing Machine at
MIT about January 1, 1957 will create a definite need for addi—
tional funds_—to finance the conversion of existing Whirlwind

programs to Type 704 programs.

Reference: Contract N50ri-06001 DIG-#63N5, #6915

Under the proposed plan submitted herewith, Project
#63h5 (Whirlwind Operation) would terminate on June 30, 1957.
The task order for this period would include the usual Whirlwind
proJect activities:

1. Research in methods of numerical analysis and
the formulation of scientific problems for machine
solution. together with the training or personnel
in these methods°

2. Support of the Scientific and Engineering Applica—
tions Group of Project Whirlwind so as to make the
computer useful and available for the above—mentioned
research..

In addition, it is proposed that the following task
order arising in connection with the Type 704 EDPM be included:

3. The development of a suitable interpretive program
and associated coding techniques to permit effective
implementation or the Type 704 machine.

 

It is anticipated that a separate project will be set
up to handle the Type 704 utilization within the MIT Computation
Center, and a separate request to the ONE for support of this work
will be made in the near future. In this respect certain
experienced programmers could be made available for transfer to
this new task as of January 1, 195?. This anticipated transfer
has been taken into account in the budget proposed for Project #63h5.

The foregoing proposal does not take into consideration
termination costs which may be associated with the close out of
this contract and the possible disposition of the Whirlwind Computer.
It is proposed to delay the submittal of any budget for this matter
until such time as disposition of the Whirlwind Computer is
determined.

The estimated budget for the period July 1, 1956 to
June 30, 1957 is attached herewith as page 3.

Very truly yours,
