| ‘In irda with our Hachaiton: on 5 SE T Sie ads
arrangements with Frank Verzuh and Dean Arden to turn over to them all

Sb. ou

of the responsibilities I have enjoyed in conmection with the lait

: wn ans L Batwing Group oi we TELE Computer TBE ETory: praen

| Dr. Verzul, FE, an | attempt £0 coordinate the digital Songs
‘tion facilities at MIT, will take over the finameigl supervision of the
group. This will involve not only the handling of the budget, cost
controls, etc., but also our acceptance of problems from MIT sources
outside of our group, the provision of such services as tape prepara~
tion, computer operation, and problem consultation for outside pro-

grammers, the issuance of suitable Teper, and the  utgetey SAsEzal Ne

9 personnel.

Dean Foitin will take over the technical direction of the
numerical analysis and programming research activities of the group.

~~. Comsequently, he will be responsible for the technical supervision of

the staff. The size of the staff will be maintained at a sufficiently
high level so that some fraction of the staff time may be committed by
Verzuh for maintaining a satisfactory computing service.

It is expected that some of the overlEiping respodnibiiities
will become more clearly defined and be resolved within & short time.

With these adjustmente made, I feel that I will be able to
“resign my D.I.C. appointment on 1 sephember 2055.

I would like to express my appreciation for the opportunity
of working with you and’ ‘the other people here at MIT.

| Sincerely y

Jack gh
