Dear Dr‘u'MOrBei ‘ 7'. : “ : ‘

Thank you fo'ri'your letter of November 30. Wefaxfe, of course,
appreciative of MIT's pre-eminence in the field. of high-speed
amputation. Our thought inmaldn'g our suggestion was not so mud:
to do any selling as, possibly to present to some uninitiated seg-
ment of your student population the thought that computing offers
some outstanding career opporttmities and to give them‘the views of
a. fairly typical industrial installation on practical, down-to-earth
uses of this equipment.

Thanks, also , for your invitation to present a technical paper
at your seminar. We do not feel prepared for this at the moment
but we will certainly remember the offer and hope that it will still

be open in a few months from now when perhaps we will he in a posi-
tion to accept it.

Very truly yours ,
