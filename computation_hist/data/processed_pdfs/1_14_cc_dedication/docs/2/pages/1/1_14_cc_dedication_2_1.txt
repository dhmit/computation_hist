Since the wiring of the 704 is not yet completed, the
checker-playing program we had hoped to put on for you will
have to be postponed. The Center quarters will be open for
your inspection between 10.15 am. and 12.00, there will be
a. stand-up lunch served in the Conference Room on the first
floor at the end of the building at 12.00, and there will be
a discussion of the program of the Center in Room 6-120
(lain Building, East side, first floor) from 1.00 to 3.30.

From 10.15 to 11.30, in the 701! Room, Frank Verzuh
will describe the equipment. Between 10.15 and 10.1l5 and
between 11.30 and 12.00 several members of the Center staff
(1151: appended) will be in the 704 Room, and will be pre-
pared to answer various questions concerning the equipment,
procedures for using it and our plans for research. Each
member will be glad to answer general questions, but each
has his own specialty (mentioned in parentheses after his
name) and, if you have specialized questions, we suggest
you look up the appropriate person. Each is wearing a
yellow badge with his name on it.

Room 6-120, is:
