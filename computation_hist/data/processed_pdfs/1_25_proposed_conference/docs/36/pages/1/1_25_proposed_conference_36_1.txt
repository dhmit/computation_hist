Dear Professor Morse:

The forthcoming National Conference of University Computing
Center Directors was discussed at the December 18-19 Conference
of University Computing Centers of the Southwest in Tucson, Arizona.
There was general agreement on one item, - a wish that the five
Sessions be held in sequence rather than in parallel, so that each
Director would be able to attend all of the Sessions.

 

 

 

I suggest that this may be done, if the Chairman and the
Secretary are so minded, by imposing on each Session Chairman
the requirement that he start and finish his session on schedule.

In my own case, I am constrained to attend the Session on
Computing Service to University Departments, but my interests
are equally great in Computer-Oriented Research (Session 2) and
Curriculum and Instruction (Session 3).

Enclosed is an extra copy of the Questionnaire which I have
mailed out, which you may keep. Another, to be returned to me, has
been mailed separately.

Yours truly,

8, /8 SFoene

D. R. Shreve
Director
