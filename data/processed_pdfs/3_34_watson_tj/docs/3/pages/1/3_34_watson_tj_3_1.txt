Dear Professor Morse:

Mr. Watson, Jr. is presently out of the country and,
therefore, I would like to acknowledge your recent letter to him
concerning our participation in the Computation Center at M.T. 5

[ am sure Mr. Watson will enjoy reading your letter
as well as the thoughtful note from Dean Mead and I am forwarding
the letters to him in Europe.

Sincerely yours,
