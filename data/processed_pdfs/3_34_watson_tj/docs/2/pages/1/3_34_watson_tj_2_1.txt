Dear Mr, Watson:

At the recent meeting of the college representatives
in the cooperative program of the Computation Center, there was
considerable comment on the success of the program this year
and on the value of the IBM comtribution to the educational
programs of the New England colleges, Dean Mead of Tufts Univer-
sity suggested that he write me, for transmittal to you, an
expression of the appreciation of the college community for the
contribution you and your corporation are making to education and
research in this new and important field., I enclose his letter.

Let me add my own appreciation to his, I feel that the
arrangements and contribution of IBM in support of this cooperative
program are an outstanding example of the way industry can
creatively contribute to the education of scientists and engineers
in this country. I say this as often as I can and, in as many
places as I can, in the hopes that other companies will begin to
come up to the high record IBM has already made in this respect!

Sincerely yours

Philip M., Morse
