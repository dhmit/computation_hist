Dear Arthur:

I enclose a draft of the Report of the Chicago
meeting of University Computing Center Directors. It was put
together from the Panel reports, and has been checked with all
the Panel Chairmen now, so it will shortly go to press. As
you can read, the main Report wlll be accompanled by eight
appendices, giving attendance, agenda and Panel reports with
discussion. I hope you like 1t and that it wlll be of use to
you Â®

We will prepare enough copies of the complete Report
plus Appendices to send one to each Director who was invited
to the Conference, plus about 200 extra to take care of later
requests. We will also make 100 to send you; if you would like
more, please let Frelberger know soon.

In addition, as I mentioned to you at the Conference,
Perlis suggested, and we agreed, that we have the Report, with-
out the Appendices, printed in the Communications of the ACM.
We will order reprints of this, to send to people who don't want
to read all the detalls in the appendices. If you want coples
of the reprints, please let Frelberger know soon.

Yours,

Philip M. Morse
