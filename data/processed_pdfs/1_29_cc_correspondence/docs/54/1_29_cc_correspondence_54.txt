Dear Frank:

This is a request for additional 70) time for problem i139,
our waiting-line computation. The program for this problem has Just
been changed to use single-precision arithmetic, after a certain
stage, in order to shorten the computing time. Approximately
one hour of time trials and de-bugging is needed now, after which
& separate request will be made for time for the production runs
implied in my memo of November 8.
