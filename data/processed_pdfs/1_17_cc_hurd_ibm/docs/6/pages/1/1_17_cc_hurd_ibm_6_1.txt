Dear Cuthbert:

Truman Hunter came to see me some time ago to
discuss & proposal, which we are considering, of
putting a nominal hourly charge on the use of the
704 Computer by government and industry sponsored
D.I.C. projects. Our plans are still in the formative
stage, but we would propose to create a2 fund which
would be used solely for expenses of the Center beyond
those covered by our I.B.M. contract, In addition to
our expenses, we would on the M.I.T. shift build up
some reserve which could be used for furthering the
work of the Center.

The principal cguestion is how we would treat pro-
jects from other institutions which were also financed
by government or industry. Our present thinking is that
we would make the same hourly charge against such pro-
jects, but that as a3 result no funds would accrue to M.I.T.
In other words, we must be guided by the principle that
operation of the second shift will be on the beasis of
no profit/no loss to M.I.T. Therefore, for the other uni-
versities our actuasl expense only would be deducted from
the hourly charge and the balance would be returned to
each university to be used by them for the same purposes
for which we expect to use our own fund.

I think it is particularly important for M.I.T. to
maintain a position with the other participating in-
stitutions that we do not benefit financially from their
use of the Center.
