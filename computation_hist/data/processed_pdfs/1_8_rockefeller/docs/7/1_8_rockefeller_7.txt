Dear Professor Morse:

Thank you for your letter of May 11;. Like the Center,

our annual report has been delayed, and the picture section is

still not quite complete. We should therefore be glad if you
would keep us in mind when the photographs are taken. Even

though they do arrive too late, they can always be held in

reserve for next year's report.

 

Sincerely yours ,
