Formal instruction in b) would be in two directions: b') one week courses
in various topics in numerical analysis, say one lecture per day, and b")
similar courses in supporting mathematics.

A rough outline of topics would be:

Classical numerical analysis

Linear equations and inversion of matrices

Non-linear equatioms

Characteristic values of matrices

Quadrature, ordinary differential equations

Partial differential equations

Integral equatiomns

Linear programming and game theory

Statistical calculations

Discrete variable problems: number theory and combinatorics
Experimental mathematics; developable areas in numerical analysis.

Each of these short courses might consist of:
A comparative survey of methods
A detailed discussion of a particular method
A review of practical experience
A discussion of an example worked on the NBS machine
b". 1. Theory of approximation
Bounds for characteristic values
3. Applications of functional analysis: error bounds for linear
processes and estimates of quadratic functionals
4. Asymptotics
5. Turing machines, recursive functions.
These surveys cannot be comprehensive - each week's course could well be
expanded into a semester one. However, there will be ample time for
participants, who are specially attracted to a particular topic, to get
together with the local expert, so that they can be brought up-to-date
in the subject.
c) 1 week:
Administrative problems.

Various topics such as financing, equipping, staffing, and maintaining

a computing center would be discussed. There could also be discussions of
