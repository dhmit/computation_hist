Dear Professor Morse:

Thank you very much for your letter of April 8th which
has just reached me here in Brussels.

Your and Dean Mead's kind comments are most appre-
ciated. All of us in IBM are concerned with the educational challenge
that faces our country and hope that our participation in your program
will contribute, in some way, to the solution of the problem.

I would like to take this opportunity to tell you how pleased
we are with the program of the M.I. T. Computation Center. Please ex-
tend my congratulations and best wishes to the members of your staff and
to the Advisory Committee.

Sincerely yours,
