Dear Fresgldaent :

 

It is with great pleasure that I am able
to invite the participation of your lnetitution 1in a note-
worthy new research Â»rogram at Massachusetts Instltute of
Teechnology.

The International Business Hachines Cor-
poration, througn ite President, Mr, Thomas J. Watson, Jr.,
has generously offered to install at the Institute a Type-7O4
Electronic Computing Hechine, theilr largest hlgh-speed research
computer, with the understanding that all the colleges 1in New
Bngland may share in i1ts use. Dellvery of the machine will
take place in about one year.

The intention of Mr. Watson lg to provide
facilities for fundamental research in sclence, englineering,
applied business and the new field of data processing and for
the training of personnel in computer operation, No classl-
fied work will be done and researcih must be of a non-routine
nature, contributing to basic knowledge, The plan now belng
considered porovides that up to seven hours a day of macnine
time will be avallable for participating colleges other than
nI.q,

The equipment 1s to be lncorporated 1lnto
an M,I.T. Computation Center, with Frof. Phillp M., Horse as
Director. I1.B.M. will provide a malntenance staff and has
kindly offered fundg for the support of as many as twenty
research assistants, up to half of whom will be appointed
from other educational instituticne, to undertake research
in the utilization of high-speed computers. However, opera=-
ting ataff coets will have to be shared by the users,

Most effective utilization of the macinlne
might be aschieved if, as a partial contribution for staff
support, each participating lnstitution could assign one or
more members of its faculty to spend sufiiflclent time at M.I.T.
to learn to operate the machine and to supervise the prograim-
ming of problems, These representatives of the institutlons
could consult with other members of thelr faculties on projects
for the computer,

We propose to form an Advisory Commltitee,
with representation from other colleges, whlch would work
with the Director on such matters as schedullng, priority, and
the types of problems which should be submitted,
