Dear Mr. Webbers

As I mentioned to you several weeks ago, I
have checked with the National Science Foundation and
found that the enclosed proposal for an extension of our
present project with a small additional inecrease in funds
is satisfactory with them.

I suggest therefore that you arrange for the
necegsary signatures and make this proposal formal to the
Foundation. At the time we spoke you were not certaln
that this proposal for extension of time would even need
Dr. Floe's signature. He 1s willing to sign, however,
if it l1ls necessary.

I would appreciate it if you could get thli s
off since the Foundatlion is expecting 1it.

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse, Director
M.I.T. Computation Center
