OFFICE OF THE PROVOST August 14, 1962

Technology

Cambridge 39, Massachusetts

Dear Dr, Morse,

Miami University is planning to institute an undergraduate
irogram in systems analysis as a part of our regular offering in the
School of Applied Science. We had hoped to launch the program this
autumn, but various complications have delayed us until the present
moment with the result that it is probably too late. We are pre-
pared, therefore, to wait untl the fall of 1963 if necessary.

We are seeking a man to teach introductory four-hour courses
in data processing and computing analysis and to plan the remainder
of the four-year program. The right person could expect to head up
the project, although we expect to bring in additional staff later on
which might include a director, if it should be indicated. I am en-
closing a copy of the job description.

We would be very much indebted to you if you would suggest
names of persons who might qualify for the position we have available.

With many thanks for your courtesy,
Sincerely yours,
SR

Charles R, Wilson
