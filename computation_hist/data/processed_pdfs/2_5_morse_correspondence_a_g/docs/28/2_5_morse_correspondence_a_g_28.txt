On the other point, the alr conditioning. I want
to let you know that I am no longer worrying about its A
additional cost since I got the figures. We can prove, in
the case of the air conditioning, that 1/3 of its cost

requirements which we didn't care about in the first place.
In addition, for the 160,000 we are not getting the con-.

again) so we are going to have to demand more pressure, even
if it costs more money--otherwise We can't use the 70% for
classes. The need for the additional pressure comes entirely
