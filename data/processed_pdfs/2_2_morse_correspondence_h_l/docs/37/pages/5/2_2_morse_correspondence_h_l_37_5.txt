offect on the course of the ¥° curve. We therefore consider only the case
C —P(i;ysically the curve a represents complete §hielding {)f the central
ion from the wall; since both field and perturbajtlon potential are zero at
the wall in this case, the central ion does not induce any charge at the
surface. The curves b and ¢ represent partial shielding, while when
¢ = d, we have nearly complete shielding.

We have used three methods for solving Eq. [5] subject to the bound-
ary conditions just described:

(A). We may venture to predict a comparison between the atmosphere
formed under these conditions and that which would be formed in a
homogeneous solution with constant K equal to K(x,)(6). The bulk of
the constant K atmosphere is contained within a sphere with radius of
the order of K.

K (z,) = 5ea Sec” Z—C’ > o

K-'(x,) < 0.7(c — z,), so that wherever the ion is, there is room
for such a sphere between it and the walls; a constant K atmosphere
would therefore not be seriously mutilated by being cut off at the walls.
As to the distortion produced by the actual variation in K, we note, first,
that this variation is confined to one of the three principal directions
(namely, that perpendicular to the walls), and second, that its first-order

effect on the potential (the term proportional to %—K-> must vanish by
X

symmetry, as otherwise its sign would depend on the choice of the posi-
tive direction for 2. We conclude that, for purposes of computing 7'
the constant K approximation should be quite good. Actually it turns
out to be in error by only a few percent. : ~

The resulting expression for Y is:
