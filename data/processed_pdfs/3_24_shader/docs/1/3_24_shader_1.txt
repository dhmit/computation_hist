Dear Mel:

We will be glad to talk with your aircraft man about
simulation, if he gets here. Thanks for your kind words regarding
our conference on the subject; we seemed to have a good turn-out,

Incidentally, I have been meaning te tell you (and I
may as well do it here, rather than waiting till we see each other
agein) how pleased we are with the way Loren Bullock is fitting
into the operation here, He's quick on the uptake, has a thorough
understanding of college problems and has the rare gift of being
firm and pleasant at the same time, I'm afraid he deserves a
better job than the one he has here, but we sure hope you leave him
with us as long as you can,

Do I see you at UCLA at the installation ceremonies?

Yours,

Philip HH, Morse
