equipment, to suggest the introduction of new courses inthe field
and to help supervise student research in this area.

Present Courses Related to Machine Computation - Eﬁﬂ; year the
Institute offeru\ twelve courses primarily concerned with machilne
computation. Two of them are given by the Mathematics Department:
M39 —Methods of Applied Mathematics and M4 11— Numerical Analysis*;
eight are given by the Electrical Engineering Department: 06.25 —

Machine-A1ded Analysis (an introductory survey course for under-‘

graduates), 6.535—Dig. Comp. Coding and Logie, Int., 6.536 —

. Machine Computation, 6.537— Digital Comp. App. Prac., 6.538 —

 

 

Electronic Comp. Lab., 6.54 —Pulsed-Data Systems, 6.567— Switching
Cireuits, and 6.568—Switching Circuits; and one, 2.215 —Numerilcal
Analysis, 1s gilven by the Mechanical Engineering Department. The
teaching of all these courses is directly dependent on the avalla-
bility of equipment for demonstration and for student practice.

At present, the total enrollment in these courses 1s about 400,
Each of these courses could be improved if more equlpment were
avallable.

In addition, the following courses touc%?on computing machine
applications or on machine design and use some equipment for demon-
stration or for student use, which use could be profitably ex-
panded if more equipment were avallable:

In the Mathematlics Department:

M371 Operations Research
