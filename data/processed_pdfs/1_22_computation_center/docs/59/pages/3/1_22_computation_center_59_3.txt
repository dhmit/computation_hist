staff set priorities and general policies of operation,
for that portion of machine time available for general
uge. With its support and encouragement the use of Whirl-
wind by atatf and students has grown phenomenally in the
past three or four years. By now the majority of the nh.n.
thesls in theoretical physies, in applied mathematiecs, in
operations research and in theory of structures add many of
the thesis in radlation theory, in aerodynamic theory and
in chemical engineering design use machine computation as
a matter of course. When one adds the research projects
carried on by faculty members, it is not surprising that
the demands had outgrown the time available on Whirilwind.
What was needed was 2 machine planned, installed
and run primarily for research and education use. With
the very rapid increase in the number of large computers
(more than a hundred large ones to be installed in 1957 alone!)
every sclentist and graduate engineer, in the future,
would have to know how to use one in his work. MIT would
have to have a computation center, supplied with a variety
of computing machines of the most up-to-date type, operated
by persons who could teach operating techniques and super-
vised by a research and educational staff interested in
working ocut better methods of machine utilization and in
research on the basic lozic of machine programming .
The staff, in addition to machine specialists,
should include sclentists and engineers, of a variety of

backgrounds, who could work with various students and
