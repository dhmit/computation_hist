Deay Dr, Shader:

We were very pleased to have a chance to report to Mr. Watson
and the others of your party om our progress. The suggestions you
nade will be of value to us and Mr, Watson's indication of his
continued support is encouraging.

As we pointed out then, we find, from time to time, that we
need auxilisry equipment, or small modifications of the 704 itself,
in order to make the machine more useful to its users. Ome example
of this, mentioned briefly at the meeting, is the addition of the
so-called Beal Time Package for the 704 main frame, This addition
would enable several E.E8. studenis to use the 704 for thelir Ph.D,
thesis work in communications, which ctherwise would have to be
done on some outside machine, or not done at all. There are
indications that, once installed, it would be continually useful,

In cases like this, I feel it only appropriate that the
Institute contribute toward the additional cost of these modifica-
tions, that iBM not be asked to contribute more than you are already
contributing., But I wonder whether it is failr to ask the Institute
to pay the same price for the modification that IBM would charge its
compercial customers., Would it not be possible, for example, for us
to pay IBM the actual cost of the real tiwe package, rather than
cost plus profit?

I would be glad to talk over this problem with you im the near
future, to see whether we can work out a mutually satisfactory
