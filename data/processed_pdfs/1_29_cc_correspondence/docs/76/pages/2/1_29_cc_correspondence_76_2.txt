PREFACE

The following memorandum is an edited and abbreviated version of
a Preliminary 709 Monitor Manual (May, 1960) written at IBM. The I'ORTRAN-FAF
Monitor System consists of three basic programs: a Monitor, a Compiler,
and an Assembler. The function of the Monitor is to coordinate compiler
and assembler processing and to simultaneously provide means for initiating
execution of object subprograms. Thus, continuous machine operation is
possible regardless of what combinations of source and object subprograms

the Monitor encounters.

The control cards of the FORTRAN-FAP Monitor System allow one in

a single run with the computer to:

1. Compile several FORTRAN subprograms and punch relocatable
binary decks for them;

2. Assemble several FAP subprograms and punch relocatable binary
decks that are compatible with the FORTRAN binary subprograms;

3. Run the resulting collection of subprograms from (1) and (2)
and previously compiled decks as a single program in the
computer,

4. Or alternatively run the program as consecutive ''chain' links

of a program otherwise too large to fit in memory;

Use of the Monitor system allows the Center to batch Jobs on a
single input tape; thus on-line card reading is replaced by the faster
tape input and the inter-job time is reduced to tape manipulation by
the Monitor. Thus, the Monitor is a supervisory program for FORTRAN,
FAP, and object subprograms. The Monitor calls in the various pro-
cessing programs as needed; it is only necessary to inform the Monitor
what type of processing is to be expected. This memorandum describes

the control cards necessary for Monitor operations.
