a. The instructions for reading input tape and writing
output tape must refer to tapes A2 and A3 by their
respective logical tape numbers,.

b. The STOP and PAUSE statements should not be used.
Programs must be terminated by a CALL EXIT or CALL
DUMP statement, or by a READ INPUT TAPE statement
when there is no more input data.

c. The END card program option controls may be replaced
by Monitor control cards. The END card itself is

still necessary.

Monitor control card information and diagnostic information,

are printed off-line as well as on-line,

THE CHAIN JOB

In the Chain job, one program, too large to fit into core
storage, is executed as a sequence of smaller programs,
Each smaller program, called a link, consists of a main
program together with all its subprograms and constitutes
a ''machine-load".

For execution, the links are stacked on any of three pos-
sible tapes. The first link in the input deck is called
in first for execution by the Monitor executive routine.
The other links are executed as they are called by the
link being executed.

There are two requirements for distinguishing individual
links: a) the start of each link must be distinguished
when preparing the input deck, and b) each link must make
provision for calling the following link during execution

of the chain job.

a. The control card CHAIN (R,T) must precede the physically
first program (or subprogram) of each chain link, re-
gardless of whether the link is composed of source or

object programs. In the card CHAIN (R,T), T specifies
