Dear Professor Panov:

... We received your four reports today and are quite pleased
and interested in them. We have several graduate students who
will be able to make the necessary translation. In exchange I
am enclosing the latest copy of our progress report which deseribes
our first efforts in the new Computation Center. I have put the
name of your Institute on our malling list and will send you
further reports as they come out. Similarly, i1f I see other
material such as reports which may be of interest to you, I will
get them to you.

I hope that you and any of your staff will visit odur
