| In Scarlets with our ‘ digonssion: on 5 Saiz. I fave ands:
errengements with Frank Verzuh and Dean Arden to turn over to them all

Or eu

of the responsibilities I have enjoyed in connection with the a

oh and Engineering Group a% the Bgisal Computer Laboratory. Pie

| Dre Verzuh, FE an | attempt to coordinate the digital Sonpute-
‘tion facilities at MIT, will take over the finameifl supervision of the
group. This will involve not only the handling of the budget, cost
controls, etc., but also our acceptance of problems from MIT sources
outside of our group, the provision of such services as tape preépara~
tion, computer operation, and problem consultation for outside pro-

grammers, the issuance of suitable Teports, and. the  “buigetary’ ‘gontrol I

or personnel.

Dean Avisa will take over the technical direction of the
numerical enalysis and programming research activities of the group.

. Comsequently, he will be responsible for the technical supervision of

the staff. The size of the staff will be maintained at a sufficiently
high level so that some fraction of the staff time may be committed by
Verzuh for maintaining a satisfactory computing service.

It 1s expected that some of the overlapping responsibilities
will become more clearly defined and be resolved within & short time.

With these adjustmente made, I feel that I will be able to
resign my D.I.C. appointment on 1] Septuher A055.

I would like to express my appreciation for the opportunity
of working with you and ‘the other people here at MIT.

| Sincerely 5
