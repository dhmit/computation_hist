5, Instruction, Nearly 90 percent of %he directors atten-
ding the Conference had acadenic appointuments, Thibs is appro-
priate; for much of the task of the Computing Center in a
tniversity is related to instruction, either in teaching new
isers the elements of coding, or in advising bow to pProgram
lifficult problems or in teaching or helping to teach courses
r2lated o computer science. The essentviale of coding are now
simple onoush so that an under-graduate, with little mois than
hipgh=scliooi mathematics can begin to use s rarticular macoine
after 4 Go © hours of lectures (after which he continues %
learn ty using, of course). llany Centers give such short cciing
course:) three or four times a year, for no acadenic credit, ay
an hour which does not interfere with regnlar cisses, Persons
lesir’ng to use the machine are usually required to take such
a course. Other Centers insert the half-dozen lectures on coding
in one or more regular subjects given for creiit, such as a
sourse on general principles of programming for all machines, or
a course in applied nathematics, or a beginning course in theore
etical science or engineering( any course in which the student
mny need to use the computex)

Subjects, given for credit, which are being taught by staff

nembers of some Centers, are:

Introduction to Digltal Computation - Principles of
brogramming and of machine structure. Turing machines and =
other logical foundations, A freshman or sohhomore subject.
