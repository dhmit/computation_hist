Dear Professor Morse:

The substance of the information I obtained in Philadelphia is that
the General Electric plant in Lynn will obtain a 704 machine in September, 1956,
I was told that some of the time would be made available for use by

educational institutions in the vicinity and the implication was that this
would be free of cost.

The man in chalffe is Allen Benson, Building 32, Riverworks Plant, General
Electric, Lynn, Massachusetts.

Sincerely yours,

X ot

S. H. Caldwell
