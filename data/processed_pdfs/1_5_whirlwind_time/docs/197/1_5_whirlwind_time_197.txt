Dear fal:

I have been autnorizZed to credit
your account with 5 hours of machine time on
tne Whirlwind I computer. According to your
request of 1 November 1954, this should meet
your needs through the end of January, 1955.
If you desire further credit allowance beyond
that time, it wlll be necessary that a new

request be submitted.

I nope that these arrangements will
prove satisfactory. |
