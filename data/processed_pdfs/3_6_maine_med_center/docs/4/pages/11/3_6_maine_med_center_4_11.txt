sistivity ratio increases the strength of the ima.ges.incr.eases, and the lung sec-
tions have relatively more effect on the field distribution.

EquaTions 1, 4, 5, and 6 were tested experimentally in the.double-layer tank
by using disks of various thickness in the electrolyte. In this way some errors
were found and corrected; this illustrates another use for the tank.

As a further check, the potential distributions for cases @ and & above
were calculated by the conventional method of potential t}}eory, that is, by
expanding the potential in an infinite series using polar coordmate§ and finding
a solution of Laplace’s equation that satisfies the boundary conditions. The
results were identical to those found by using Hague’s simplified method.

Simultaneous Effect of Lower-Heart and Higher-Lung Resistivities

Again we make the approximation of representing the heart and lung sec-
tions by circles. The heart E.M.F. is represented by +7 and —7. If we let
G, equal the heart resistivity ratio, then it is seen from EQUATION 4 that the

inhomogeneous heart area can be eliminated by substituting + i +1 C for +1
1
and =1 i_GIG I for —I. Substituting these values in EQUATION 6, with G,

equal to the lung-resistivity ratio, the potential at any point outside both the
heart and lung areas is

5y 261 71 Gz—l 7_3
V°—1+GIA[ln-7_2+G2+1lnr4] (7)

with G; = 0.5, and G. = 4, EQUATION 7 becomes

 

 

G [m'—‘ + 0.61n9]

This shows that in addition to the potential changes caused by the lung sec-
tions as expressed by the second term inside the bracket, there is also an over-all
reduction of potentials by two thirds. Ficure 7 shows that the actual reduc-
tion is about one half, but that the observed reduction is uniform (the equa-
tions derived above are accurate only for a disk immersed in an infinite me-
dium). Thus, the effects of the higher resistivity of the lungs and the lower
resistivity of the heart tend to counteract each other in some areas and to be
additive in others, since the effect of the lung sections is to incrcasc the po-
tential at some points and to decrease it at others.

Straight-Line Boundaries Belween Regions Having Finile Resistivities

With straight-line boundaries, two image systems are necessary, depending
on which side of the boundary potentials are measured. Consider a sink —/
and a source 4/ immersed in a conducting medium having resistivity p’,
which is separated from a medium of resistivity p by an infinite straight line.
For the measurement of potentials within the medium in which the source and

In these equations, it is assumed that all space has the resistivity p’. Dia-

Potential Due to a Source and Sink Inside an Ellipse: Mathematical Expression

Since the thorax cross section so closely resembles an ellipse, an attempt has
been made to find an image system for a source inside an ellipse, but this has
not been successful. Hicks® described an image system involving a line-source
and line-doublet distribution between the foci of the ellipse, but the evaluation
of the potential was difficult. Therefore it was necessary to expand the po-
tential in an infinite series of elliptical harmonics, using elliptical coordinates,
and to put in the boundary conditions that the potential V and its first deriva-
tive were everywhere continuous inside the ellipse (except at the source itself)
and that the normal derivative was zero at the boundary. By making an
approximation leading to an error of about 1 per cent, the infinite series ex-
pansion was reduced to finite form.

It can be shown® that the relation between the elliptical coordinates # and
v and the rectangular coordinates x and y is given by the equations:

* e A Nene (10)

(? cosh? u (? sinh? u
cos?v + sin2v = 1 (11)

Then the curves # = constant are a family of ellipses with major axes on the
X axis and minor axes on the Y axis. FIGURE 1 shows the parameters for the
ellipse chosen to represent the thorax section. For this ellipse, # = #,. A
line between the foci would represent the limiting ellipse, # = 0. The lines
v = constant represent a system of orthogonal, confocal hyperbolas.
