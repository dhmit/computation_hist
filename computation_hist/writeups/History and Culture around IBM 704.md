#History and Culture around IBM 704
The IBM 704 was created in 1953 as the first mass-produced computer with floating-point 
arithmetic hardware. This is an arithmetic that uses formulas to represent numbers which is why 
floating point errors exist. This introduced a trade-off between range and precision in computation.
The production of the IBM 704 was discontinued on April 8, 1960.

At the MIT Computation Center, the IBM 704 was used as the official tracker for the Smithsonian 
Astrophysical Observatory Operation Moonwatch in the fall of 1957.

##Gender
In the beginning, women were given the roles of programmers as it was seen as an easy job 
compared to electrical engineering which men preferred. Many thought that programming was a 
perfect fit for women due to the planning required in producing code similar to planning a dinner.
Once men wanted to take over jobs in programming, hiring managers implemented math tests into 
their recruiting procedure which gave an advantage to men who had access to math classes.

##Economy
Computers were not seen as a household product yet as the price of computers was too high and 
took up too much space. For example, the IBM 704 took up an entire room and costed up to $2,000,000.
The IBM 704 however was adopted by many large institutions.

After WWII, the economy was prospering and grew by 37% under president Eisenhower in the 1950s.
American families had 30% more purchasing power by the end of the Eisenhower era. However, this 
was still not enough to make the IBM 704 seem like a good investment. Computers had to become 
cheaper, rather than having families increase their disposable income.
