OPERATIONAL ASPECTS OF PRESENT M.I.T. COMPUTING FACILITIES

lntroduction

This memorandum is intended as an Appendix to the report entitled

ggguirenents for Electronic Conggtigg Equipment for
.1nigg and ror Bducational Research at the Institute

which was submitted to the Administration by the Institute Committee on
Numerical Analysis and Machine Computation on May 1, 1854

The purpose of this memorandum is to describe some of the aspects
associated with the operation of various M.I.T. computing faciliies. Princi-
computing facilities are listed, approximate operating costs are given, and
machine utilization is classified into the following categories:

1. Academic: Classroom Lectures and Thesis Research
2. Adninistrative Office Procedures

3. D.I.C. Sponsored Research

4. Military Applications

Although there are many computers of various sizes available at M.I.T., this
report is confined to a2 discussion of the larger facilities:

1. Aeronautics Dept.-- Philbrick & Simulation Equip.--Prof. W. McEay

2. Dynamic Analysis Control Lab.--DACL--Dr. W. Seifert

3. Elec. Engineering Dept.--REAC--Prof. G. Newton

4. Instrumentation Lab.--REAC & Simulator -- Dr. H. Laning

5. Rockefeller Diff. Analyzer--RDA--Dr. F. M. Verzuh

6. Statistical Services-~IBM~--Dr. F. M. Verzuh

7. Whirlwind--WWl--Prof. C. W. Adams

8. Desk Calculator Groups--RLE~-Prof. H. Feshbhach

9. Desk Calculator Groups--Aero-eclastic--Prof. R. Bisplinghof

Ogggation and Maintenance K Costs

Table I contains lnfornafion rogarding the number of individuals
and their associated annual cost for each of the principal M.I.T. computing
facilities. The :ollowing personnel breakdown is utilized:

1. Analyst: Numerical analysts, CPC progragmers, WWl programmers
2. Operators: Card punching, Tape preparation :

3. Engineers:

4. TechnicÂ¢cians:

5. Secretarial:

6. Administrative and Service

7. Others

Admittedly, this breakdown is arbitrary and somewhat inadequate for all types
of computing facilities; however, it does serve to minimize verbiage and to
permit 2 more direct comparison of costs.
