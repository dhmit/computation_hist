Dear Professor Morse:

Recently the enclosed paper was accepted for publication in the
ATEE journal, Communication and Electronics. As you probably
know, the ATEE has a policy of publishing discussions of papers
along with the papers themselves.

Dr. Juncosa and I feel that you might want to comment on this
paper in which one way that linear programming plus high-speed
computers can contribute to communication network design and
operation is discussed.

With regards to you, Dean Arden, and our other friends in your
OR group.

Yours sincerely,
Roted Kadaka
