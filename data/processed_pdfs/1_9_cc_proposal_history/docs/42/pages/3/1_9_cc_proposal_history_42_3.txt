What would be desirgble would be to cons
equipment into one unit, with a single group of pe3%§:aﬁﬁn§?§§ it
and then to get someone to Support at least the machine mainte-
nance and operating costs. The costs for the Programming staff
(one senior administrator, 6 to 10 computer-technicians, 4 to 6
research assistants plus the 8 technicians now employed’by the
Institute for M.I.T. administrative machine work) could perhaps
be born by the Ingtitute in the way we support shop technicians,
a8 a necessary part of an educational staff. The scientific
8upervision could come from faculty members already here. If

DIC and DDIL projects for enough to pay for part or all of the
8alaries of this programming stagef. For example, if 1/ of the
time were available for DIC work, and the DIC projects paid at a
rate corresponding to the commercial rentals of the IBM equipment
(528,000 per month), they would just about pay for the programming
staff salaries. It probably would not be wise to allow DIC projects
to have too large a fraction of machine time, even at the first

and it not be wise to sell computer time to any outside organiza-
tion, for this would be competing with companies that pay full
ratea for their IBM equipment.

Unfortunately, if Whirlwind is to be the high-speed part
of this combination, the costs will be considerably greater than
those outlined in the preceding paragraph. Whirlwind is s8till an
excellent machine, but it was one of the first omes built and it
was not designed for Space-saving or for cheapness of upkeep. It
could not be easily moved, so that if a combined computer service
were to be set up, the IBM equipment of Statistical Services would
have to be moved to the Barta Building, further away from the ad-
ministrative offices it serves than it 18 now. Or else two sepa-
rate groups would have to be continued, with consequent duplications
of personnel.

IBM Interest - The IBM Corporation has 2 considerable interest in
the Training of scientists and engineers in the use of computing
equipment, and it has had some contacts with" the Institute. 1In
another two years it will be turning out equipment (types 704 and
705) which will be nearly as fast as Whirlwind, will be better
equipped as to input and output facilities, will be considerably
smaller in size and power requirements and which will fit much
better with our present IBM equipment to make a single computing
service center. If IBM can be ‘induced to glve us a remodelled 701
or a TO4 or 705, rent-free, and to remit further charges on the
equipment Statistical Services now has but keeping up maintenance
of the equipment, the Institute would then have a computing ecenter
which could effectively and efficiently satisfy the computing
needs in categories a, b and c. M.I.T. itself would then only need
to pay for the service staff and the power costs, which might be
paid in part by some paid computing service for DIC and DDL projects.
