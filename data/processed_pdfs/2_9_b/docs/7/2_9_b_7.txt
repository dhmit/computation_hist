Mr, Harvey Burstein

M. 1. 7.

Dear Mr, Burstein:

At the Computation Center there are various categories of i
individuals who have need for parking permits. 1 have thought about this
requirement for some time and have tentatively rank ordered them as follows:

Group

Faculty and staff k
Research assistants |
IBM customer engineers

Applied Science, IBM, Cambridge
N.E, Universities weekly visits.

con

1 wonder how you have decided to rank the MIT family when you issue parking ;
permits.

I find from time to time that you have been accepting requests
for parking permits under various signatures, 1 would appreciate it if you
would only acknowledge parking permit requests for Computation Center issued ¢
by me. This is one way in which we may control the actual "need fo enter’.

Finally, I would like to again request a parking permit for a
Bernard Cohen who is a Research Associate at the Computation Center,

Sincerely yours,

F. M., Verzuh :
FiV:ab Assistant Director X
