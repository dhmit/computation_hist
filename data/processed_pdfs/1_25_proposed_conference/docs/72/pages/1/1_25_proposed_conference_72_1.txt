" Dear Professor Morris:

I must apologize for not writing to you sooner regarding the outcome of the
questionnaire I sent on budget and administrative matters connected with university
computing centers, I sent the questionnaire at the end of July and by the end of
September I had received 42 replies,

Even though this was a detailed questionnaire and included several matters
of a confidential nature, almost all of my replies have been very complete, I
therefore feel that I owe these people some concrete results for their effort, At
the present time I will relate to you some of the more obvious conclusions that I
can make, and I will attempt to write up a more detailed summary which can
possibly be used as a basis for discussion at our projected meeting,

The three most obvious conclusions are the following: There is unanimous
agreement on as open a shop as consist@nt with reasonably efficient use of the kind
of hardware that is available, In 40 cases out of 42 the center is supported at least
partly by general university funds, In only 5 cases is the computing center under
the administrative control of a department, In almost all of the other cases the chain
is from director to a vice-president of the university or a dean of faculties or a dean
of the graduate school,

I asked for a brief statement of the philosophy of the Director., The responses
to this were most interesting, some of them quite lengthy, A synthesis from all of the
questionnaires would go about like this: The Director is still trying to sell the com-
puting center as a university-wide research tool, In some of the more established
centers he has to take care that the routine uses of the equipment for statistics and
more obvious scientific calculations do not use up so much of the time that novel
applications are neglected, The usual answer to this problem is to encourage by
furnishing programming talent those problems which are novel and have no other
sponsorship, There is general agreement that trained people at all levels are much
more in need than is new equipment, although in many cases some new equipment
is quite desirable, There is further agreement that the computing center should
guard against becoming a service bureau in the sense of running routine problems
at the cost of exploring new areas, even if such a policy means a financial lost,
