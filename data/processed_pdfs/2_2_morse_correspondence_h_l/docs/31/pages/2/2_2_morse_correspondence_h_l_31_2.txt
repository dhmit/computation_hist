283 THEORY OF ENVELOPE TYPE THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY TESTS

orthogonal coordinates #= const. (isotherms), v= const.
(surfaces of flow), and ¢=const. (planes through the
axis of symmetry).

All observations are made at thermal equilibrium;
the settling time to reach equilibrium has been found
to be relatively independent of the shape of the vessel,
and may be found for special simple cases.

Therefore, we proceed to solve the laplace equation
subject to boundary conditions of constant core and
environment temperatures, and continuous heat flow
in the walls of the vessel:

V20=0. (1)
When U=1u, 0= 01.
When #=1u,, 6 and k30/du continuous (k= thermal

conductivity).
If 6=A(x) is a solution of Eq. (1), then the solution
satisfying the boundary conditions is:

 

 

E A—A,
0=0,+— (63— 6;) in region “‘a” (2a)

ka A3— 1

k A—As
=f3+— (6;—03) in region “b,”  (2b)

ky Ai— A

where A=A(x); A=A(u1); As=A(us), Ra,s=conduc-
tivity of region “a, b,”

(Ag— Ay)/k=[(As— A2)/ko ]+ [ (Ae— A1) /ka.

The amount of heat crossing an isotherm per unit
time per unit area is

W= —kVO=— (03—01)EV}\/(A3—A1)

N.B. Though A depends on % only, VA is a function of
u as well as of v.

The amount of heat crossing an entire isotherm per
unit time 1s:

00/ dt=— (03— 0)kF FVA-dA/(As— Ay),
where

$FVA-dA

indicates integration over the entire isotherm (over-all
values of » and ¢); the expression is independent of .

A(kS) AA .
30/0t £ FVAIA
A(kaoa)/A(kbeb) = AAO/AAb° (4)

In Eq. (3) the right-hand side is found from the
geometry of the vessel, so that measuring Af and
80/t gives k, whereas Eq. (4) may be used to check
the result found for 2, when k; is known, by measuring
A6, as well as Af,.

The amount of heat crossing an isotherm per unit
time is given above. The amount of heat crossing a
plane slab of comparable thickness across the same
difference in temperature is proportional to the area
of such a slab. In order to find out how large a slab
would correspond to a vessel of comparable thickness,
we equate the rate of heat transfer for the vessel and
the slab, finding for the area of the slab:

A= (us—u) f $VAIA/ (As— Ay). ()

There is always an isotherm with just that area; the
area being dependent on %, we can then find the loca-
tion of this “average isotherm.”

Vo is inversely proportional to the separation of the
isotherms. Since heat flow is trapped between surfaces
of flow, V6dA must be constant between any two flow
surfaces. Therefore, near regions of high isotherm prox-
imity, the flow converges (see Fig. 2).

Isotherms always crowd together near highly curved
portions, so that we conclude that the lines of flow are
also quite dense near such highly curved regions of the
isotherms. Therefore, we expect that most heat leaves
the core where the core is highly curved.

B. CHOICE OF THE SHAPE OF THE CORE

possibly a cylinder. In order to minimize heat flow from

the ends, hemispherical guards were installed. Analysis
of the heat flow in spheres and in cylinders shows that
it is impossible to have isotherms that are described by
cylindrical surfaces joined along a plane to hemispheri-
cal surfaces; any different shape of the isotherms, how-
ever, causes heat flow across some portion of the plane
of junction, so that no guards eliminate nonradial flow
entirely. Therefore, a spheroidal core was designed, and
the surfaces u=1u;, us, and u3, together with the flow
surfaces v= const., were found to be confocal spheroids
and hyperboloids of revolution of two sheets.

C. CYLINDRICAL ISOTHERMS: (u=r, v=z)

V2= (1/r)(d/dr)(rd/dr).
A(r)=logr.

The radius of the average isotherm approaches the
arithmetic mean between inside and outside radii of
the cylinder from below as the thickness of the cylinder
becomes small compared to the radius.

Therefore, the average isotherm’s position obeys the
same qualitative statement as that of the cylinder.

 

E. JOINED CYLINDER AND HEMISPHERES

Figure 3 shows how the isotherms crowd toward the
core in the curved hemispherical portion of 'the wall.
Although it is possible to vary the scale of this part of

the drawing by varying the average conductivity of the
guards, it is not possible to match up the hyperbolic
temperature distribution in the guards with the logarith-
mic function in the cylinder. Generally, when two
regions are joined such that their joint surface contains
a discontinuity, then heat flow somewhere along their
plane of junction causes distortion of their isotherms to
join smoothly.
