Reference:; Contract N5ori-06001

Dear Bir:

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology submits
herewlth a proposal for extension of the reference contract to
June 30, 1957 at an additional estimated cost of $20,960.00.

We understand that this proposdl has been the sublect of discus-
glons between Professor P. M. Morse of MIT and Mr. A. J. Wise

of ONR-MIT, Dr. Carl F. Mukenhaupt of ONR-Boston, and Dr. F. J.
Weyl of ONR--Vashington.

There follows & summary of expenditures and funds
remaining on the two projects, Whirlwind Operation and Machine
Methods of Computation, which are currently active under the

. reference contract:

 

Project #6345 (Whirlwind Operation) hes an unexpended
balance of $#97,000 as of November 30, 1955. The current expend-
itures are approximately $10,000 per month. The average "income"
received for Vhirlwind ugage is approximately $3,000 per month -~
a net expenditure of $7,000 per month. If it is agsumed that the
present level of income ($3,000 per month) is malntained during
the nineteen-month period Decembsr 1, 1955 to June 30, 1957, a
minimum amount, essuming some tapering off, of $119,000 will be
required during this perilod.

Prolect #6915 (Machine Methods of Computation) has an
unexpended balance of $71,000 as of November 30, 1955. The current
expenditures are approximately $7,000 per month. If it assumed
thet the present expendl tures remain constant, there will be a
balance of epproximately $22,000 on June 30, 1956. In accordance
with our present plans for terminating the ONR support of this
project on June 30, 1956, there will be certaln additional term-
inating expenditures. It is estimated that $7,000 will be
expended for termination purposes.

This summary is based on estlmates prepared by Prof-
esgsor P. M. Morse.

\â€™ Profesgor Morse further advises that the expected
arrival of an IBM Type 704 Electronlc Data Processing Machine at
MIT about Januvary 1, 1957 willl create a definite need for addl-
tional funds--to finence the conversion of existing Whirlwind
programs to Type 704 programs.
