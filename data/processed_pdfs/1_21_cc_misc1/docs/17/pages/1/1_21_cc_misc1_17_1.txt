Dear Professor Morse:

I will be coming to Cambridge
in a couple of weeks, and I was wonder—
ing if you could have lunch with me,
either Friday the 13th or Saturday the
lith. I will be staying at the Hotel
Statler, so we could have lunch there
if that is convenient, or at some
other place of your choice.

Sincerely yours,
