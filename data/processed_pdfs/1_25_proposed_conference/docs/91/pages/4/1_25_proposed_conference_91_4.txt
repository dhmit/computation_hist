v?xldtsincrease the value of such activities to the academic parti-
cipants.

In conclusion, let me say if you have read this far, your patience is
greatly appreciated. I hope that there will be sufficient reaction to
cause you to sit down and dash off a few thoughts that bear on the re-
lationship between IDA end educational institutions. This reaction

would hopefully include additional items for the listing, uninhibited criti-
clsm of my comments, and additional views.

On the basis of the response obtained, I will then attempt to work up
some form of a document that will at least glve some of the opportunities,
possibilities; and difficulties presented to IDA in its attampt to make

a contribution to education.

Sincerely,
