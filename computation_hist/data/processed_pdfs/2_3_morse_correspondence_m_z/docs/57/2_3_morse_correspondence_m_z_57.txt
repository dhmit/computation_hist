Dear Mr, Baker:

Tuesday, January 8, seems to be a bad day. However,
Dr. Brown is free at 10:30 on Thursday, January 10 snd Professor
liorse is available at 3:30 the same day. Will this be convenient
for you?

It looks like we can get computer time for Jim on
Wednesday, January 9 at 3:30 A.M, and Thursday, January 10 at
4 P.M, in two two-hour periods,

Professor Morse has suggested that the grant be left
with the Electrical Engineering Department, but that the work
be integrated with the operations research program and the ne
putation @nter,

Sincerely yours,

Dean YN, Arden
