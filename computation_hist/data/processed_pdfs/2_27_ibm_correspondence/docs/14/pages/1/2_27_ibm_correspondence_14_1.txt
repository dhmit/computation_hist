Dear Mr. Kearns:

exclusively related to computational techniques. However, most
of the maJor departments and schools suhh as the School of
Industrial Management, the departments of Mathematics, Physics,
and Electrical Engineering have one or more professors who are
interested in computational problems.

 

 

those in the School of Industrial Management. If a student
wishes to work toward an advanced degree, he must first be
admitted to one of the departments. Persons in the School of
Industrial Management who might be interested in data processing
problems of various types are Professors Forrester, Gregory and

Durand. Further information should be obtained by writing to
the department.

I hope the above is of some assistance.

Sincerely,

F. J. Corbato
Assistant to the Director
