. . . ,Ihe salary connected with such a position would be at our regular
D.S.R. (Division of Sponsored Research) scale,- which gives a minimum
figure of $450 a month for a person with a master's degree, working
time, so that you could expect something of this ‘order of magnitude.

 

Before making anything in the nature of a definite offer, Ifeel = .

that it would be desirable to have an interview. We should be glad to pay
your expenses for a day's visit to M.I. T. at some convenient time, if you
feel that you can make it. Also we should like to have a letter of recom-

mendation from Professor Thomas. If you'are‘lnterfested.,mthe__ possibiltty,,_ s
