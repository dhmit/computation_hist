Dear Dr. torse:

For some time this Center has been interested in the
apnlication of certain methemetical and statistical models,
such ag game theory, to the nroblems of personnel utiliza=
tion in the military service. We are concerned with a
variety of problems which may be attacked with the use of
certain of these medels.

An exammle of the sort of problem which we have in
mind is one of minimizing the cost of training Air Force
technicians. There are available nsychological tests
which give a zood indication of a man's nrobable success in
technical school training. 7These tests give differential
predictions for different kinds of training with concomitant
different probabilities of success. With these probabilities
and with good estimates of the cost to train men in each of
the several specialties, it is hoped that a minimizing Â»ro=-
cedure night be used to indicate the most economical way of
assigning individuals to technical training, while at the
same time taking a minimum risk of not meeting the Air Force
requirements,

e are also interested in the application of general
nurnose commuters to the nroblems of personnel utilization,
particularly the solutions of mathematical models which might
be aporopriate for personnel classification and training, es-
pecially methods of managing very large masses of data, which
considered separately have 1ittle predictive wvalue, but whiech
considered as 8 whole, permit good estimates of future per=
formancs.
