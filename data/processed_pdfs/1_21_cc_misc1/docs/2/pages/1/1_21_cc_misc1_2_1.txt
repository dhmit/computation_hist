Memorandum to:

Professor C. L. Miller
Room 1"263, }'I.I oTo

Aifter I discussed the new Civil Engineering
undergraduate curriculum at the faculty meeting yester-

day afternoon, Professor Morse asked if there was any
help that the staff of either the Computer Center or

the Operations Research Center could give us in regard
to the new course, 1L.04T.

His offer included both in-
structing time and laboratory aild.
