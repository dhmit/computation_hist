formal, in the design and use of computing equipment has always |
been closely related to the availlabllity of such equipment, at

the Institute. It was available here quite early because of the

jnterest of Vannevar Push and his students. The Electrical Engi-

neering Department had most of this equipment before 1940, a

Differential Analyzer, a Network Analyzer and others, fhe few

courses and were attended chiefly by E. E. majors. As the equip-
ment increased in effectiveness, however, staff and students of

other Departments became interested until, by 1940, at least half

 

 

of the 24 attendees of 6.60 Math--Anal. by Mechanical Methods
were from other Departments.

Since 1945, the Institute has added a great number of computing
devices to its facilities: Whirlwind, some I.B.M. equipment,
several large electronic analogue devices, and 8o on. Some of
these are in the Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering Depart-
ments, so that more students have close contac?t with thelr con-
struetion and use. Because of the growing importance of such
equipment in engineering and sclentific training, the Institute

set up an interdepartmental Commlittee on Numerical Analysis and

Machine Computation to coordinate the educational use of His
