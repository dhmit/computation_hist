Dear Mr. Merrill: ey

TN .
I have just received information rok Dr. Ershov a an All-Soviet
Conference for Computational Mathe putational Tech

niques will be held in Moscow from October 12 through 18. Since this is
the first such conference that we have known about ahead of time, it would
appear very useful to all of us, since Ershov is speaking at and attend-
ing the ACM meeting in Cambridge, if we could arrange to have one or
more U. S. representatives invited in return.

He has given me the address of the organizing committee (translated
from his Russian):

Moscow V-234

Moscow State University
Mechanical-Mathematical F=culty
Chair of Computational Techniques

It appears to me that we should propose that they invite one or more
American computer people to give a paper at their meeting. This might,
however, interfere with Perlis's or other's plans to go to Novosibirsk
later next year, however, so I throw this out as a possibility.

Sincerely yours,

John W. Carr, III
