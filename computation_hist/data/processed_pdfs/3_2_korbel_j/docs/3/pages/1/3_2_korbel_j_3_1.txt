Propossl for s Btstisticel Investigstion of Lshor Force Pnticipstion
snd Iobility to be convicted hy Septe-ber 30, 1958.

This request is for $23,805 to fins-cs e study of the lsbor force
psrticipetics responses of individusls. The object would he to estinsts
the prohshilities thet individusls would enter, reesin in, depsrt fro-
or reesin out of the lsbor force under vsrious codinstions of circus—
stssces or inputs. The inputs to he considered would include the deuch
graphic end econolic cherecteristics of the individusl end his fuily;
his pest ststus with respect to lsbor force psrticipstion; end certsin
chsrscteristics of his environ-Int such ss region, urbsnisstion end the
stste of lsbor delsnd.

These estiestes would be used to i-pluent the lonte Csrio type
simulation of the United Ststes socisi-econolic systee proposed by ()rcutt.1
Such s simletion requires lsrge numers of psrsmters or sets of over-ting
chsrecteristics describing the hehsvior of the isdividusl decision-“inc
couponents of the systeu. These open-sting chsrscteristics ere the
prohshilities of verious types of response or "outputs" under vsrious sets
of prior circuutsnces, stiluli or "inputs".

Iesides serving the Orcutt sodel, such I sultivsriste stetisticsl
investigstiou would slso he's veluehle hy-products. Due to the si-ulteneous
sction of the vsrishles referred to shove upon lsbor force psrticipstion end
turnover, it has been extreuely difficult to disemgle their influences.
Published tsbulstioes relsting to lebor force psrticipstion end gross flows
into snd out of the lehor force hsve not been sufficiently uross-olsssified
to sustsin the necessuy ststisticsl snnlysis. The funds beiu requested
would he used pri-erily for covering the expense of finer cross clsssificstions
of Current Populntiou Survey results thss hsve heretofore been carried out,

mltivsristc stetisticsl mslysis spplied to such cross—clsssificstions

 

would isolste the seversl influences sud their intersctions so ss to

 

slleviste the necessity for casing to conclusions such as the following:
"whether the well-educsted won-n to nerries end hes children is sore or less

likely to be enployed then the nether who hss less education is not known."2
