‘tion facilities at 3111“, will take over the financial supervision of the
groin» i'hi'a 111.1 involve not only the handling of the budget, cont
controls, etc., but also our acceptance of problem from m sources
outside of our pony, the provision or such services he tape prepara-
tion, computer operation, and problem consultation for outside pro-

grammers, the iasumce of suitable reperta, and. the “budgebarf control
of personnel.

Dean Arden will take over the technical direction of the
numerical analysis and. programming research activities of the group.
Consequently, he will be responsible for the technical supervision of
the gtai‘f The: sire of the staff will be maintained at a sufficiently
high level so that none fraction of the staff time may be emitted by
Verzuh for maintaining a. satisfactory cmputing service.
