suggested Guidance for the Research.

The research activities of the Computation Center are
guided and coordinated by an Advisory Committee consisting of

overall policy guidance 1n all activities. But to gulde the work
in social science outlined above W€ will need another, more

participating institutions will be invited to Jjoin a special advisory
