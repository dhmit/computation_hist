have to limit their actual contaet with machines to one or two
hours of demonstration per term, whereas they could and Mld ex-
pand this time enough so each student has a chance to participate
in the operation, 8o he can actually get a "feel" for the process.
Such an expansion of contaect hours is impossible at present; iith
careful scheduling 1t could be accomplished with an approprlatély
located 704, with adequate space and auxiliary equipment. Eveﬁ
with the courses listed above, 1t could easily grow to 3000-4000
student contast-hours per term.

As soon as more equipment 1s available, more courses in
business data handling can be initiated and the course in operations
regsearch can be expanded. Probably other courses, inc sub ject nnot
yet envisaged, will also be made possible.

Plang are now being made to expand our research program in
operations_research, in systems engineering and in the quantitative
analysis of 1ndustrial and governmental operation. Funds will be
sought to increase the number of assistantships and fellowships
which can be granted for research in these fields, 8O that we can
compete with other fields for the good students. None of these
plans could be implemented unless we are sure We will have the
best computing equipment, adequately housed and appropriately

staffed.
