TAPENO

BSS

 

 

It usually is desirable to refer to a tape unit symbolically;
the TAPENO pseudo-operation is used to equate a symbol
appearing in the location field, with a tape unit, appearing
in the variable field. The variable-channel tape operations
enable the programmer to change the tape number, tape channel,
or both simply by changing the TAPENO pseudo-operation and
reassembling. When TAPENO is used, the specific channel
designations A through H need not and should not be used

even in such instructions as RCHo, LCHX, etc.

The symbol appearing in the location field of the TAPENO
pseudo-operation must be a single letter between I and Z
inclusive. The variable field contains a channel letter
(Aâ€”H), followed by the tape number, followed by the letter
B if the tape is to be treated in the binary mode. The
absence of a terminal B implies the BCD mode.

If X is defined as

X TAPENO A2B,

then the instructions RCHX and RCHA are equivalent. The
instruction is assembled as if the X in the operation code
were replaced by the channel-letter A. (The instructions,
LCHX, SCHX, TCOX, TCNX, TRCX, TEFX, BTTX, and ETTX are
treated in a similar fashion.)

If the operation code also requires a tape number (such
as RTDX, RTBX, VTDX, VTBX, WRSX, WEFX, BSRX, BSFX, and
REWX), then the instruction is assembled with the X re-
placed by the TAPENO definition. For example, with the
X as defined above, WTDX, WTBX, WRS X, and VTBA 2 are

equivalent.
