| Dear Father Walsh:

I am pleased to enclose a check for $1, 150. 00 for the second
semester portion of the Boston College appointments to the M.I1.T.
Computation Center as described on the attached sheet. The IBM
Corporation is very grateful for the work of the Research Associates and
Assistants in the program for they have contributed a great deal to its
success.

There are now thirty-four colleges and universities in New
England participating with M.1.T. in the Computation Center. The new
IBM 709 has been in operation for four months, and already seventeen
of the colleges have made use of it. For your information, I am enclosing
a table of usage for the months September - December, 1960.

I am delighted that Boston College is developing an increasing
interest in computing and I hope you will soon be able to have more
extensive facilities on your own campus. Please do not hesitate to call
me if I can be of any aseistance.

Sincerely yours,

M. Loren Bullock
University Representative
