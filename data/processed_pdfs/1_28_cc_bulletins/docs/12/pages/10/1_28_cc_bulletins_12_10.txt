CLA BbREMARK

Note that the blamk that would appear nmormally in column 11 is displaced,
Substitutable location fields may be used similarly, If a substituted
"loeation field" is longer than seven characters the operatiom field will appear
in the compiled instruction directly after it, but separated by a blamnk,

11, Substitutable ggggation Codes

12,

Operation codes are substitutable, The dummy argument mames used
as operation codes must be mo longer than three charascters and nay appear
anywhere in the operation field.

If an operation code is mot found on the argument l1list, the contents
of columms 8, 9, 10 on the inmput eerd are stored im the macro definitiom exactly
as punched. The programmer should be careful in using SAP mnemonics as MoP
arguments: for instance, in the following example both appearances of CAL
will be treated as substitutable.

BCD Withim Maero Definitions

If the variable field of a BCD card within a macro definition begins
with a number or a blank, them the indicated number of words (the mormal SAP
convention is that a blank means 10 words) will be stored as part of the macro
definition, However, if it is desired that some or all of the BCD informatiom
be substitutable, the requirement of a count im columm 12 causes a problem.
For this case two alternatives are provided:

1) If a comma is found im columm 12, the comma is replaced by a BCD
count of 1, and the remainder of the variable field of the BCD card is scamned
to pick up the single dummy argument which should follow., The first blank
encountered will terminate the scan. When the macro is used, a single BCD word
may be inserted to follow the count of 1, Examples
