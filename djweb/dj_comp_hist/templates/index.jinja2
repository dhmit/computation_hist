<!--This is the base page. I want to take the links to the data off of this page and create a data tab that will
bring people to a webpage that looks like this one currently does. I'm thinking of taking the other tabs off and
having them all exist under browse. Then, I'd put tabs for other parts of the project, such as the simulations. I
don't know how to make a new page or change the way these links are set up, though-->
