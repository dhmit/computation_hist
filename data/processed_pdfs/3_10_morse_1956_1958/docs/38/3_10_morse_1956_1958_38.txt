Classroom space for 704 course -= August 20 - 31, 1956

The following rooms and space have been formally reserved
with the Schedules Office for the period August 20 ~ 31, 1856:

Room Capacity

52-153 16
52-154 36
82-155 48
52-156 35
2-190 200

The present plan is to have the formal lectures in Room 2-180

(capacity 200) each morning. However, this room is reserved for our
use all day long =o {that we may schedule a number of afternoon lectures.
Unfortunately 2-190 is not air conditioned, but it does have lantern
projection facilities which will be of value during the conference.

The space in Building 52 consisting of eight (8) rooms on the
~ first floor will allow us to accommodate a group of 100 with an average
of about 12 persons per room. Since each room cen handle at least 16;
we are again safe os far as capacity is concerned.

Thig arrangement will be satisfactory siuce the morning lectures will
be held in Building 2 followed by luncheon at the Faculty Club at noon,
and then the afternoon session on the first floor of Building 52.
