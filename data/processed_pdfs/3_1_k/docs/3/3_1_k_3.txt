none of the atudents who are likely to graduate with me this year would
be suitable for yonr purpose, as they do nothave sufficient machine

connection, to Dr. T. W. Olle, a former student of mine (Phe De. Manchester,

praduation has been employed by tiie SHAPE ‘o:puilny Canter at the Hague on

w.rmly as : competent and energetic young man, fully versed in hia trade.
Unfortunate.!y he is rot movable immediately: but shonld you be interested

Ad ty recommend 40 him that it may be in his interest to
