Dear Professor lMorse:
In accordance with the finenciel discussions held at our cone

ference on October 29, I am enclosing a copy of a report entitled
SUMMARY OF STATISTICAL SERVICES OPERATION which cowers the fiseal

 

period 1063-1954, Among other things, this report gives a break=

down of the income obtained from verious eustomers in three prine
cipal categories:

l. Administrative offices,
2¢ DIC and institute research,
Js Non=iM.IsT¢ customers.

I think this summery is of inbterest since it provides an
indication of the distribution of the services offered by this office;
furthermore, it shoudd serve as a bisis for predicting what may hapren
during the fortheoming fiscal periode You will notice that the
Machine Computation Committee contract (DIC 6915) expended §1523.16
whereas the Operations Research contract expended $1192.15 during this
periods In a sense, these amounts are rather misleading because they
give no indications of the amount of free time which was ($iven to both
of these groupss To shed some light on this matter, I ha%ve prepared
a second report entitled FREE IIME ANALYSIS, whith indicates the CPC
time which has been given to verious groups free of charge. That is
to say, it does not indicete the labor and persunnel time which has
been (piven free of charge to these grohps. The reason is, of course,
that €he CPC time is the most veluable since it costs $15 a hour., I
would like, therefore, to have included similar figures for free labor
end personnel time. At the moment, it does not appear that the infore
mation this would relay would Justify the effort required to get this
date from the ledger. Perhaps succeeding reports of this type will
give a brealtdown of machine time, personnel time, and materialse.

At any rate, from these two reports we may make the following
