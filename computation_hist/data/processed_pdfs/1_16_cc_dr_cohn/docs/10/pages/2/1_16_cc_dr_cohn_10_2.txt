A PERIODIC ALGORITHM FOR CUBIC FORMS I1.*

By HARVEY CoHN.

 

art II. In this continuation of our discussion
of a cubic sign-discrimination algorithm, int.roduced in an earlie‘ar volume of
this JoUuRNAL [7], We shall turn our ajctentlon to the computatlo?l of units.

First of all we shall show (leaning once mor‘e‘ 01.1 the Minkowskiay
algorithm) that all units are di.scoverable by th(.e nelghb?r process ” of
Part I [7], pp. 829-833. In so doing we n.lust rest?lct our lattice to a mody]e
M of preferably (but not necessarily) all integers in a totally real cubic fie]g
@. The field @ need not be abelian but the module 2 must be non-singular
(i.e., of dimension three over the rationals). The units would then lie in 9
the order of the module .

Secondly we shall consider the manner in which the units shoulg be
written. As we observed in [7], p. 833 certain 3 X 4 matrices are propor-
tional only under certain rearrangements of rows and columns. This malkes
it desirable to have a hypercomplex notation, which also brings out normal
symmetries of the matrices.

In comparing our modified algorithm with its Minkowskian progenitor
we start with the realization that what we are doing is refining the algebraic
properties of the algorithm at the expense of the geometric properties, hut
the algebraic simplifications make numerical work * more feasible while the
geometric complications make themselves felt only in existence type proofs
which are disposed of here. This dichotomy is illustrated in the geometric
and algebraic portions of the present work.

Existence of Units.

16. Types of neighbors. We consider a reduced matrix ¢ in the sense
of 4 (above) consisting of four column vectors which we shall write as

we shall classify the 24 neighbor possibilities (explained in 10 above) into
three types depending on the partition of the symbols serving as second and
ihird element in the neighbor operation :

Type 1 Type 2 Type 3
P, 8 or Q. B 0,8 or P, R R,8 or P,0Q
(QPS), (PQR) (PQS), (QPR) (PRS), (RPQ)
(16.2) (RPS), (SQR) (RQS), (SPR) (QRS), (SPQ)
(QSP), (PRQ) (PSQ), (QRP) (PSR), (RQP)
(RSP), (SRQ) (RSQ), (SRP) (QSR), (SQP)

LeMMA. Every reduced matraz ¢ has either one or two (reduced)
neighbors of each type.

Outline of Proof. We must consider the subdivision into cases as deter-
mined by the relative magnitudes of each row: (| pil,| |, |7, |si]),
(compare 11). There are actually twenty-four different cases (to within
elementary interchanges of rows and columns and changes of sign in rows).
The details are omitted in the interests of brevity we simply remark that
this method was used in the (weaker) statement made earlier [7], p. 830
that there are from three to six neighbors.

17. Occurrence of independent units. The units deduced from the
Minkowskian algorithm were “ controllable ” in the sense that.if we take a
succession of neighbors to one Minkowskian triple by “ lowerl‘ng the.same
face” (say ;) each time we would obtain a unit whose anJugate is less
than unity and whose other conjugates are greater than unity In a.bsf)lute
value. If units are formed corresponding to two different they are inde-
pendent by the classical argument of Dirichlet. .

The same thing can be done here, except that the “ face” correqundmg
to @; belongs to none of the vectors in the quadruple (16.1), e.g. l.t ‘(133
