IBM 704 Computer

Westinghouse has recently installed and has in operation an
IBM 704 computer. We currently have some time available
and, if you need 704 computer time, we would be happy to

let you use our machine at a rate of $500.00 per hour,

We have set this rate as equivalent to the IBM Service Bureau
rate in view of the comparable facilities; that is, we have
four tape units instead of six.

At the present writing, we are not in a position to do any
programming. We have machine time only available without
assistance of technical personnel from Westinghouse.

If you are interested in machine time, please contact either
the writer or Mr. Frank Engel, Jr., Advisory Engineer, Ana-
lytical Department, East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, direct
and we will be glad to work out a suitable arrangement.

We will appreciate your transmitting this announcement to
the other personnel in your organization that might be in-

terested in the use of our computer.
