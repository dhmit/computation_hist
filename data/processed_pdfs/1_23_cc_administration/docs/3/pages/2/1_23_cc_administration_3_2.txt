Extension of NSF (2940 Page 2

Plans for Next Year

 

All of these projects, and more, will stretch the capabilities
and energies of the Computation Center staff. We expect to add
two more senior staff members this summer and hope to persuade two
men now completing their Doctor's degrees to stay on as Junior
staff members for a year or two. It is certain that most of the
research subjects outlined in our original proposal to NSF will
be begun this coming year; it can be expected that the NSF portion
of support for this work will reach the yearly rate of $35,000
as indicated earlier, and it 1s expected that this yearly rate
will continue at about the same level for several further years,
as was forecast in our original proposal (see Enclosure B).

We therefore request that Grant NSF G2940 be extended to
June 30, 1958, with additional funds of $13,000,

Signed
