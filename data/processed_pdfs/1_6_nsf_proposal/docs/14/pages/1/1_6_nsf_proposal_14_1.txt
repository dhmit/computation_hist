SUBJECT: Material for Nationsl Science Foundation Proposal

 

In accordance with our discussions regarding the proposal to NSF,
I am enclosing the following information.

 

The M.I.T. Computation Center will have a Type 704 Electronic

| Data Processing Machine with the following machine complement:

.5 12 magnetic tape units, 2 magnetic CORE storage units containing a
. total of 8,000 words, 1 magnetic drum unit containing 4,000 words

of storage, the usual on-line punched card reader, alphabetic printer,
and punched caxd recorder as well as the 3 off-line magnetic tape
controlled printer, magnetic tape controlled card punch, and punched
card-tomagnetic tape converter s respectively. ToTai-meekine
S ¥ il Forentel--is skt 5,06 In addition
to the 704 there will be 10 auxiliary punched card maehines including
card punchee , collators, sorters , reproducers, interpreters, and the
Type 407 Accounting Machine. regate machine rental y & in
excess of § 50,000 per nonth’ w a@: é\,m&hc\ l\‘BM

The Type 704 EDPM unit is one of the fastest large-scale
commercial computers available today. Since the M.I.T. installation
. will be but one of many in the field, techmniques, programs, and
numerical procedures developed for this machine will be of umiverssl usey
