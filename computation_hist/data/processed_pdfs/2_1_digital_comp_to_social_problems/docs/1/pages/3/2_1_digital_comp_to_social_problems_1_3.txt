interest, however:

1. A basic investigation of the machine techniques for
computation in the general field of linear programming--dynamic
programming—~input—output analysis, which promises to be of con-
siderable importance in economics and in operations research. The
economics departments at both Harvard and M.I.T. are interested
in applying such techniques to their work. Professor Orcutt at

appears likely that new programs, planned to utilize the considerably
greater high-speed storage of the new machine, can greatly improve
the speed of solution. It is likely that fundamental improvements

in techniques of solution of these problems will also prove valuable
