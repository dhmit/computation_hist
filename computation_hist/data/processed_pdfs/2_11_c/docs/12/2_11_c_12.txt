a course'or so and oould'go to various seniners around the place.
If, for example, hewanted to eventually get a doctor's degree,
he could work at the center for a year or e‘o‘and then take a
part-time Job while'working for his degree. ,.

We have a wide range of problems from those of language . h _
translation to those of calculations of nuclear characteristics.
We do not code the .usual problem which comes to us, so these
persons would be engaged mainly in the special and interesting

problems and in writing out programs rather than detailed
coding, (although there may be exceptions).

I would appreciate it it you could let me know of any
person who might be interested in taking such a position either
this spring or next summer, or in suggesting that such people
should write me directly. The salary we would offer would be
normal to universities, no as high as industrial positions, but

the man would have the opportunity or further class work and would
have contact with a wider variety of problems than in industry.

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse
