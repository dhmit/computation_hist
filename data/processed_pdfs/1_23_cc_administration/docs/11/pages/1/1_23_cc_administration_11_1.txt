MEMORANDUM
To: Mr. R, P, Webber, D.S.E, February 10, 1958
From: Director, Computation Center

Subject: Proposal to Extend Contract NSori-g0 withont Increase of Funde,
WWW

A o During the past year the persomnel of the Computation Center
have been using two computing facilities; the Vhirlwind I installation
in the Barte Building and the mew IBM 704 installation in the new
Compton building, The work using Whirlwind has been supported by
contract NSori-60 and that using the 704 bas been supported by other
grants, although the nature of the work is closely related. Now that
the Whirlwind eguipment has been turned over to the Lincoln Laboratory,
the work of the Center uses the 704 equipment exclusively with consequent
inereage in effectiveness because work is now sll done at one place,
using one machine, and duplication of office and machine operaticns is
eliminated, :

2, Work a8 doscribed in task orders of N5ori-60 continues to be
ecarried cut by the Center, though now the 704 is used to try out the
programs and suxiliazy eguipment rather tham W W.1. For example,
Anendment No. 13 (6/28/51) etates im part:

"3 On and after 1} July 1951, secticn (a) shall read as follows:

(A) The Contractor shall furnish the necessary perscunel and
facilities for and, in sccordance with any imstructions
issued by the Technical Officer or his authorized repre-
sentative, shall cenduct a coordinated ressarch program
in applied mathematics utilizing facilities in the Center
for Machine Computation, including the WHIRLWIND Computer,
which shall include but not necessarily be limited to the
following:

 

(1) research in methods of numerical analysis and the
formulation of scientific problems for machine solutionm,
together with tke training of personnel on these methods;

(2) support of the scientific and engineering applications
group previcusly associated withk Project WHIRLWIND so as
to make the WHIRLWIND Computer useful and available for
the above research, including a continuation of the
congtruction and improvement of the WHIRLWIND Computer;
and

(3) an investigation of digital computing machine components."‚Äù

Work coming under sub-headings (1) and (3) of this amendment is
being continued by the Center,
