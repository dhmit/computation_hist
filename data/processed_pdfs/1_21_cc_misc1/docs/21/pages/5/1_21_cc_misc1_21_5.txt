MEMORANDUM
To: Mr, R, P, Webber, D.S.R. February 10, 1958
From: Director, Computation Center

Subject: Proposal to Extend Contract NSori-60 without Increase of Funds,

During the past year the persoanel of the Computatiocn Cemter
have been using two computing facilities; the Whirlwind I imstallation
in the Barta Building and the new IBM 704 installatiom in the new
Compton building, The work using Whirlwind bas been supported by
contract NSori=60 and that using the 704 has been supported by other
grants, although the nature of the work is closely related. Kow that
the Whirlwind equipment has been turned over to the Lincoln Laboratory,
the work of the Center uses the 704 equipment exclusively with consequent
inecrease in effectiveness because work is now all dome at one place,
using ocne machine, and duplication of office and machine operations is
eliminated.

VWork as doscribed in task orders of NSori-60 continues to be
carried out by the Center, though now the 704 is used to try out the
prograss and auxiliary equipment rather tham W.W.I. For example,
Amenduent No. 13 (6/28/51) states in part:

"3, On and after 1 July 1951, section (a) shall read as follows:

(A) The Contractor shall furnish the necessary persconel and
facilities for and, in accordance with any instructions
issued by the Technical Officer or his authorized repre-
sentative, shall conduct a coordinated research program
in applied mathematics utilizing facilities in the Center
for Machine Computation, including the WHIRLWIND Computer,
which shall include but not necessarily be limited to the
following:

(1) research in methods of numerical analysis and the
formulation of scientific problems for machine solution,
together with the training of personnel on these methods ;

(2) support of the scientific and engineering applications
group previously associated with Project WHIRLWIND so as
to make the WHIRLWIND Computer useful and available for
the above research, including a continuation of the
construction and improvement of the WHIRLWIND Computer;
and

(3) an investigation of digital computing machine components."

Work coming under sub-headings (1) and (3) of this amendment is
being continued by the Center.
