Dear Dr. Price:

I am extremely sorry not to have been here while
you were here. I had looked forward to talking over with
you in some detall plans for our work in the soclal seclences.
We had not intended to start in earnest on this program
until this f2l1l1 and I had hoped that I could use your advice
in planning the start. It was of course not surprising to me
that things here were at such loose ends when you arrived and
I had hoped that, together with you, we could arrange things
better when I got back. Your leaving of course leaves us
somewhat up in the air and I will have to act on some of your
suggestions without your valuable presence.

I do hope that you were able to get some work done
while you were here and I should very much hope that you could
visit here once in a while this fall to help us get started.

T believe we could arrange to pay your expenses for these
trips. Could you let me know what times in October and
November you could come here for a day or two or as much as a
week ?

I am most anxious to get this project started right,
I realize the various shortcomings that you mentioned to

Corbatos and am anxious to take care of them as completely as
possible,

Again let me thank you for your suggestions.

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse
Director
