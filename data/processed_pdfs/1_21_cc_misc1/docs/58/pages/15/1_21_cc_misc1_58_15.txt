.. A few years ago a machine user had to become familiar with

2inary arithmetic and with all the other idiosyncrasies of the primary
machine operating code, just as the early auto owner had to be familiar
With spark and choke and clutch, As time goes on it 1s less and less
necessary for the occasional user o master all these details in order
to use the machine, even if he has to devise a program for a new problem.
In the first place, many of the more usual calculations will have been
diready programmed so that, for example, if one wishes to compute a
Bessel function or to apply the chi-squared test for the fit of a
formula to a set of data, one need only use the ready-tested program;
In the second place;â€”it is possible to provide a heirarchy of "trans-
lation procedures" -- assembly and operator programs, ete. -- whereby
the machine itself will traanslate the desires of the user, expressed
in language more femiliar to him, into the specialized "language" of
the basic machine code. This may be termed programming at the second
