for some index k depending on £ providing only that |2 — *| < e.
Conversely, if a lattice has these properties for some ¢, 7 and Q + 1 n-tuples
as described, then the lattice is stable.

 

 

This is the type of property that Mahler [7] established for certain cases
where his theory of “bounded reducibility’’ applies. The property is an easy
consequence of the definition of stability given above. As a simple corollary
we note that when £ is stable, then for some positive ¢, 5, and all |2 — @ < ¢
we have M(®) < M(*) — 77[8 - g*l.

T.hus, ifl a sense, M(£*) is a local maximum by virtue of the Q + 1 specific
lattice points for which the value is assumed.

satistying condition (5.2) for stability. Hence it would seem precarious to expect

The vectors are to come increasingly close to the 2Q vectors of the unit star in
“me order (without coinciding). Furthermore each vector is selected to be
inearly independent of the set consisting of earlier chosen vectors (if any)
ogether with the 2Q vectors of the unit star. This process will at every step
'ef‘"e cones about the vectors of the unit star inside one of which the next vector
