NOTE ON FIELDS OF SMALL DISCRIMINANT

HARVEY COHN‘

The problem of ﬁnding totally real ﬁelds of any degree and small
discriminant is of interest, aside from intrinsic reasons, because of its
connection with critical lattices for the product of the coordinates.
The ground-work, however, seems to be largely unexplored. This is
probably illustrated by a somewhat persistent conjecture [41’ that
for totally real ﬁelds of degree (g—1)/2, where g is a prime >3, the
smallest discriminant is g‘"—3’”, achieved for R (cos 21r/ g), where R is
the ﬁeld of rational numbers. (This islthe maximal real sub-ﬁeld in
the ﬁeld of the gth roots of unity.) This conjecture was often made im-
plicitly even before its veriﬁcation [l] by Davenport for g=7 (the
case g=5 having been trivial). We disprove this for these g, such as
13, 37, etc.,for which (g+1)/2 is also prime. We use relative quadratic
ﬁelds built on base ﬁelds of small discriminant, a device used previ-
ously by Mayer [3] in his work on biquadratic ﬁelds.

The counterexamples are constructed by adjoining to the totally
real base-ﬁeld k the quantity a‘”, where n is a totally pasitive integer
in k which is not a perfect square; we call k(p‘”) =K. Next we consider
the prime ideal p dividing the odd rational prime p and the prime ideal
q dividing 2, in the ground-ﬁeld k. Then according to the well known
methods of Hilbert [2] the discriminant D. of K, and the discriminant
d, of k, are related by D =d2N(b) where N(b) is the norm (over R)
of the rehztive discriminant 29. Assuming for convenience that d is
add, we have 31:63“ where © is the product of all p and q that di-
vide (a) to an odd power, and I is the product of all q for which
the congruence “EU mod q’“ is unsolvable for I an integer in k,
with e equal to the exponent of the power to which q divides (a). In
the cases worked out fully (below) it will prove advantageous to
choose it relatively prime to 2 and such that the congruence paf‘
mod 4 is solvable, for then I: (1).

We take for the base-ﬁeld k=R(cos 21r/l), of degree (l—1)/2,
where l is a prime >5. For this ﬁeld d=l“—3W.

(i) First we take ,u=5. Since (5) is unramiﬁed and ,uEl mod 4,
then b=(a) and N(b) =5”‘””. Therefore K“) =R(cos 21r/l, 5‘”) de-
