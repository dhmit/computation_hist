Machine Complement of the M.J.T. Computation Cente

The M.I.T. Computation Center will have a Type 704 Electronic
Data Processing Machine with the following machine complement:
12 megnetic tape units, 2 magnetic CORE storage units containing a
total of 3,000 words, 1 magnetic drum unit containing 4,000 words
of storage. the suns on~line punched card reader, alphabetic print
and punched card recorder .as as well as the 3 ofi-line magnetic tape
controlled printer, magnetic tape controlled card punch, and punched
card-to-magnetic tape converter, respectively. Total machine
complement net monthly- vental is slightly over 345,000. In addition
to the 704, there will be 10 auxiliary punched card machines including
card punches, collators, sorters, reproducers, interpreters, and the
Type 407 Accounting Machine. The aggregate machine rental is in
excess of § 850,000 per month,

 

Toe Type 704 EDFM unit is one of the fastest large-scale
comercial computers available today. Since the M,XI.T. installation

will be but one of many in the field, techniques, programs, and
numerical procedures developed for this machine will be of universal use.

in the Office of Statisticnd Services he is concerned wiih the

utilization of IE punched card equipment to fulfill the nesd of the
M.I.T. educational and rescarch projects. In this connection go

number of research contrac ts have been executed for various branches

of ihe armed services. In July, 1955 he was placed in charge of the
operation of the Whirlwind Computer -~- the high-speed machine currently

sed for scientific research at the Institute. Again, several research
projects are being conducted using this computer as a basic tool.
