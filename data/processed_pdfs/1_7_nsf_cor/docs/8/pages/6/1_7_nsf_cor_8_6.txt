card-punching, testing and running of their problems. We
estimate $50,000 a year can come from payments from other

groJects for the programming service described, leaving about
70,000 a year to be obtained from other sources.

The Rockefeller Foundation has granted the Computation
Center about $100,000 for three years, beginning July 1, 1957,
for the support of a staff to investigate applications of
digital computers in the social sciences. Thus only about
$35,000 a year is needed to complete the support of the Center
staff, enough to support that part of the staff concentrating on
the physical science aspects of the activity. In order to get
ocur plans well under way, this grant should be continued for
about three years (as with the Rockefeller grant), after which
tg: pdrzgram should be re-evaluated to determine needs beyond

Proposed Research - Possible Initial Directions of Investiggtign

1. Investigation of Structure and Syntax of input languages;
the possibilities of coding directly in mathematieal, logical or
business language.

2. Development of routines capable of translating from
algebraic notation to computer code and vice versa, including
possibly automatic selection of numerical technigues and auto-
matiec error analysis. '

3. Development of numerical analytic techniques particu-
larly suitable for use by digital computers; such as more
general expansions, truncated Chebyshev polynomial sums for
simulating standard functions by a common block of instructions
but small sep2rate blocks of coefficients and cÂ¢ycle counters and
methods of automatic determination of best grid spacing, by trial
plug Richardson extrapolation or other means.

4, Investigation of Monte Carlo techniques for large
problems.

5. Extension and/or improvement of present techniques for
communication between machine and operator and for the more
flexible control of machine operation, ineluding possidble
improvements in input-output equipment.

6. Experimental analysis and control using data trans-
mitted directly between computer and experiment.

7. Investigation of micreprogramming and other methods for
increasing the flexibllity of computer design. The possibility
of inclusion of a very flexible control unit in a large-scale
computer which would permit ready alteration of an order code.
