will not have the 8,192 word magnetic drum nor the special half-
word logic feature which are present on the 704 at the Center.
As with the present magnetic tape peripheral equipment, there
will be two 150 line/minute printers, a tape-to-card punch,

and a card-to-tape reader.

Il Programming Systems
A. Fortran-FAP Monitor System

A large fraction of the present users of the Center
are using the 704 Fortran programming language. For the 709,
the Fortran language 1s pasically unchanged but there is a
ma jor improvement 1in that the compiler is now a part of a
Monitor System that allows control cards and includes a SAP-
1ike machine language assembly program called FAP. The control
cards of the Fortran-FAP Monitor System (hereafter called FMS
for brevity) allow one in a single run with the computer to:

1. Compile several Fortran subprograms and
punch relocatable binary decks for them;

2. Assemble several FAP subprograms and punch
relocatable binary decks which are compatible
with the Fortran binary subprograms;

%, Run the resulting collection of subprograms
from (1) and (2) and previously compiled decks
as a single program in the computer,

L. Or alternatively run the program as consecutive

"echain' 1links of a program otherwise too large
to fit in memory;

5. Use of the FMS system allows the Center to
batch jobs on a single input tape; thus on-
line card reading is replaced by the faster
