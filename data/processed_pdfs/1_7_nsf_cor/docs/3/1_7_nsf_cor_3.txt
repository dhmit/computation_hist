PROPOSAL FOR EXTENSION OF NSP GRANT No. NSFG2940
=" 222A OI0N OF NSP GRANT No. NSFPG2940
to June 30, 1960

In recent discussions with NSF staff it was suggested
that it would be appropriate to request funds for the next
three years, instead of Just for next year. Since the
program outlined in the Original Proposal, dated April 1956
and the recent Request for Extension, dated March 1957, is
for a three-year period, it certainly is appropriate to

request support for all three years now, since this has been
suggested by NSP.

I am therefore appending to this an estimated budget

for the two years from July 1, 1958 to June 30, 1960, whieh

is to be considered as an additional part of the Proposal

sent to NSF by DSR April 9, 1957, extending it for two more
years.
