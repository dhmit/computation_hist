Program

Identification Lvery symbolic program or subprogram must contain a
FAP card as its first card. This card indicates to
the Monitor that what follows is a symbolic program
to be assembled (rather than a FORTRAN source program
to be compiled). The FAP card contains the letters
"FAP" in the field defined between columns 7-72 and
an asterisk in column 1. The remainder of the FAP

card must be blank. Note that no comments are permit-

ted on the FAP card.

 

 

COUNT The COUNT pseudo-operation gives an estimate of the
number of cards in the symbolic deck. The assembler
uses this estimate to place half the intermediate

information on one tape and half on another. Thus,

 

one of these tapes is in use while the other is re-
winding. In order to know when half the information
has been processed, the assembler must know the

symbolic card count.

The COUNT pseudo-operation follows the FAP card; its
location field is blank and its variable field contains
a decimal integer, an estimate of the number of cards

in the symbolic deck.

If no COUNT card is included, the assembler assumes a

card count of 60,

Program
Termination Every symbolic program must be terminated by the pseudo-
operation END, punched in the operation field. Comments

may be punched in columns 17-80 only.
