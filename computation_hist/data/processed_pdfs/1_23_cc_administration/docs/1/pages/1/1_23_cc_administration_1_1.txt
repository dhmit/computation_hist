PROPOSAL FOR NSF GRANT TO SUPPORT COOPERATIVE PROGRAM
FOR NEW ENGLAND COLLEGES
FOR RESEARCH AND EDUCATION IN MACHINE COMPUTATION

Bacg√©round - Last year 27 colleges and universities in
New Engla gan a cooperative program of training and research in
digital computer use using the facilities and staff of the Computation
Center at M.I.T. IBM contributed the machine, a 704, and the main-
tenance staff, M.I.T. provided most of the supervisory and faculty
staff, the other colleges contributed faculty time of various amounts.

The results of this cooperative effort are promising. Two
full-length courses in machine programming (two weeks, 8 hours each
day) have been given, each to classes of 120-150 of students and
faculty members of the cooperating colleges; several shorter courses
have been given, at M.I.T. and at some of the other schools. During
the 8 months since the 704 has been in operation, problems in the
following subjects have been put on the machine:

 

Aerodynamics Languages

Antropology Mathematics

Astronomy Mechanical Engineering
Business Problems Medicine

Chemistry Metallurgy

Chemical Engineering Meterology

Civil Engineering
Education

Economics

Electronics

Electrical Engineering
Geology

Naval Architecture
Nuclear Engineering
Operations Research
Physics

Psychology

Public Administration

 

(Details of these problems sre given in the latest semi-annual
report, of January, 1958)

At present, (February 1958) about 150 preblems are active,
of which about 100 are from M.I.T., 50 from the other cooperating
institutions. The number of active problems is increasing rapidly and
the proportion of problems from the other institutions 1is also
increasing. At present the single-shift (5 days a week) operation is
running at about 80 per cent of capacity. In the near future, Saturdays
will be made operating days and in the spring we will have to go to
two=-s8hift operation.
