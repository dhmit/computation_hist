Memorandum to:

Professor P. M. HN
Dr. FF. M. Verzuh
Dr. F. J. Corbato

Subject: 704 Fortran Classes, June 8 -12 and 15 - 19, 1959

The attached lists are the representation from the New England
colleges at the two one-week Fortran classes recently held at the
IBM Boston Education Center. The large number attending plus
the wide representation from many colleges made these classes
extremely significant, and I am sure that we shall be seeing the
effects both on the campuses and here at the Center.
