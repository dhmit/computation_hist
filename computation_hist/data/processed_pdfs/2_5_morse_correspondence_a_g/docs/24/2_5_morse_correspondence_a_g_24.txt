Dear Jay:

 

am sure thet you will be relieved that I Nave persuaded the
Computation Center people to teke over this chore and Frank
Verzuh will probably do it. However, we would like to reaf-
firm the Invitation to you to take Junch wilh this group in
dining room 3 at 12:00 m, together with Reieh Freeman as host
and one or Two other colleagues.

Whether or not nol" will be ready toc show of by ‘that time
we cannot now predict, but in any case it seems appropriate
that the Computation Center people who sre charged with
needling the economists inte the apprazciation of the uses of
non” should carry the ball on this occasion,

The Reglstry of Guests nas been completely at sea in the whole

matter and has not yet found out from Mr, Dickson the nature
or the precise number of who is coming and why,

Sincerely yours,

Adviser to the President
