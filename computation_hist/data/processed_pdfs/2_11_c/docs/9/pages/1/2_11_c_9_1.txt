Dear Professor Morse:

MIT Computation Center. We at the Radiation Laboratory are
interested in working with the campus in establishing a
computer center at the University of California in Berkeley
and to this end I think we would find it helpful to have a copy

of this progress report at the Radiation Laboratory for our
staff to review. Could you send us a copy?

Sincerely,
Kent Curtis
