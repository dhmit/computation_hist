Dear Professor Morse,

Here is a copy of the Preliminary Program for the meeting of
New England members of the American College Public Relations
Association, showing the session at the Computation Center

on Thursday morning, January 9. I hope what you see written
seems appropriate,

I do not have any record of whether you have planned to join
the group for lunch at the Faculty Club, though I have a
feeling we have had some discussion of this. I hope you will
plan to do so.

 

I have asked for an indication on registration materials of
how many may want to attend the Computation Center program,
and I will keep you posted of the result as the time draws
nearer,

Meanwhile, my thanks for your help - and best wishes for the

holidays,
Ve yncprely,
Pini? Ve. chr:
