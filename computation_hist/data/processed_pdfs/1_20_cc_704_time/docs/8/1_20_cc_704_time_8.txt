Dear Mr. Stags:

 
 
        
      
   
   
        
 
   
     
  
 
 
   
  
   
 
 
 
   

This material is being sent you in res onse to a
letter you sent to I.B.M, inquiring about the 70' installation
at M.I.T. As the enclosed folder indicates, the installation
is for educational and research uses by staffs and students

of the cooperating New England colleges, and no time will be
available for classified or non-publishable research. The
machine, however, is available for the use of staff or students
on problems of mutâ€”-l interest to a faculty member and to an
industrial firm, provided the results may be published in a
scientific Journal. Therefore the 704 may be used on problems
of the sort you mention if a member of the M. I. T. faculty is
found willing to supervise the work and arrangements, financial
and otherwise, can be made to use graduate students for part

of the work.

Since it appears that your problems would fall
naturally into those of primary interest to the Electrical
Engineering Department, I suggest that you get in touch with
Professor Gordon S. Brown, the Head of that Department. Prob-
lems sponsored by his Department have access to the 704 for
the numerical solution of their problems.

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse, Director
M.I.T. Computation Center
