Dear Frank:

The 1956 O/R summer program, now finished, has
been a very successful one, due primarily to the energy
and enthusiasm of yourself and the rest of the staff of
the course. Professor Wadsworth and I want to express
to you our thanks for your contribution of time and
thought. It's been fun to run a course wlith the sort of
cooperation and help you have given us.

Thanks,
