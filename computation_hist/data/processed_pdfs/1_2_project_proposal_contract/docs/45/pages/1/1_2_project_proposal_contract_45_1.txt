Lear Sir;
We referred your proposal of October 1? #92708 to /

Prof. P. M. Morse, who is chairman of the MIT Committee
on machine Methods of Computation.

 

 

The Institute presently has in operation, supported
by the Air Force, a Differential Analyser, a REAC, and the
Vhirlwind Digital Computer (to which the Navy also contri-
butes.) We have also an UNR program conducted by Prof.

‘ Morse and some of his colleagues.

Becauae of the undoubted ovarlap between what we
&re now doing, and what you wish done under “Statement of
’ork", we believe it U0ul( be advisable to have Ir. Morae
talk with Lt. 001. H. C. Henry {nr to hr. Skinner Who, we
unxerstend, is senior civilian in anC, £n< would be war-
tioulsrly interested in thin ares.

Iecauoe of the numbers of people involved and the
compleyity of the problem I think it woulo be advisable
if tho suﬁﬁestec mentinﬁ coulﬁ ho held 5t the Institute
where the quiyment and pnrsonnel can be epsily assembled.

 

Very truly yours,
