The Industrial Dynamics Sumner Session this year will be
held Eran June 1/. to June 28. The organization of the program will
be very similar to what it was for the two weeks during August last
year. This means that during the first week we will probably want
to arrange a demonstration of the way in which the 70!. is used in
computing dynamic models of industrial systems. On Tuesday, Wednes-
day, and Thursday evenings of the second week we would hope to have
expedited running of problems which have been set up by the class
members in the afternoon and which will be taken up for discussion
on the following day.

Please let me lmow if you foresee any problems in this

schedule .
