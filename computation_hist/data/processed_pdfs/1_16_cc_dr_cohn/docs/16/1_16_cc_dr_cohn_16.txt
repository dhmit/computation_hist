ON THE FINITE DETERMINATION OF CRITICAL LATTICES
HARVEY com:1

1. Introduction. We are concerned here with the determination of
critical lattices with respect to a given ﬁnite convex body K contaiu~
ing the origin and symmetric to it. According to the usual terminol-
ogy, a critical lattice is a K—admissible lattice of minimal determinant,
while a K—admissible lattice is one all of whose points, except the
origin, lie on or outside K. it is not hard to show [5, p. 13]2 that a
critical lattice exists for every such K.

In d-dimensional space a lattice is determined by (12 real variables or
d vectors af, 04;, - - - , 11;. If K is deﬁned by a gauge function, in
vector form @(x;) g 1, then the problem is to minimize the de»
terminant of the of subject to the inﬁnitude of side conditions

where (Pi) runs through all integer sets except the origin. Now, as
mentioned earlier it is possible to show the existence of a critical
lattice of positive determinant, in fact, by the use of a compactness
argument. We shall show, however, by means of a theorem in the
companion paper [1 ], that the inﬁnite set (1) can be reduced to a
ﬁnite set whose number of inequalities depends only on d. Thus, for
instance, we are assured that when K is bounded by algebraic sur-
faces, then among the (possibly continuous) set of critical lattices, a
lattice with an algebraic basis can be found.

Results such as these are implied in the classical reduction theory
of quadratic forms and of star bodies [2]. Indeed, Minkowski [3, pp.
51, 101] solved the problem for convex bodies explicitly when (i=2
and 3, giving the most economical set of inequalities. The sets given
here will be far from economical, but the methods will be compari-
tively simple and geometrically intuitive.

vector: on the surface of the ﬁnite rymmetiic convex body K, and belong-
ing to a K admissible lattice. Then the lattice her a basix from the follow-
ing ﬁnite set:

This result is due to Minkowski [4, p. 189]; we therefore simply
note some special aspects of the lemma which tie in with familiar
results. In case there are more than d vectors (and their negatives)
on the surface, let us choose (of) so as to produce a minimal positive
determinant. Then for d=2 the basis can always be chosen as
(of, mg) itself, while for d=3 it can be chosen as (0)}, mg, w;) or
(norm; (wf+w;+w;)/2), as was known to Minkowski [3, p. 101]. If
K is specialized to an ellipsoid, then for r1§3 only the basis (an)
will occur,

3. Reduction to ﬁniteness. In the search [or critical lattices, we
ﬁrst restrict the K-aclmissible lattices to the subclass having 4 inde-
pendent vectors on the surface of K. This is no restriction since every
K—admissible lattice can be contracted to a K—admissible lattice with
the further property. We then let (0):) be such a set old independent
vectors. By the ﬁnite bases lemma, the lattice has as its basis a set
(9;) chosen from among the ﬁnite collection in (2).

Then the conditions (1), subsidiary to the minimizing of the de-
terminant of the 9“, can be rewritten as <I>( 21>; 9321, where (Pi)
are still all integral lattice points, not the origin and where equality
is achieved when the argument of <1) is one of the vectors a.
= Z‘-l (ls-9;, from (2). Now the convex body K determinesawnjugalt
convex body K0 in the p-space by means of the inequality in the pr:
‘1’( 2%- 9:)s1. Furthermore Kn contains the 2“-hedron determined

the estimates au - - . ada<dl and £1ij Iaiii for k>j (an easy conse-
quence of (221)), we ﬁnd that for instance pigd"”(dl)-W. Hence
by the main theorem of the companion paper [1], I; will contain no
p-integral lattice points, other than the origin, in its interior if it
fails to contain those in a hypersphere of radius Cdpd‘('l"”_

Thus the system of inequalities (1) can now be replaced by the
ﬁnite collection of the ﬁnite systems (one system for each basis)

In principle, 01 course, we select the basis whose system gives the
smallest determinant; and in each system we would have had to

change some inequalities to equality and to ignore many more.

When d>3, however, there seems to be no easy way to determine a
minimal system.
