FINITENESS CONDITIONS FOR A CONVEX BODY

1. Introduction. In certain problems of geometric number theory,
: e study of critical lattices, it 1s important to know when a
ex body surrounding the origin will contain no lattice
point other than the origin in its interior. In this brief note we shall
discuss a situation in which it suffices to know that only a finite set of
lattice points are not interior to the body. In the companion article
[1]* we shall show that the results of the present article enable us
to reduce the determination of critical lattices in d dimensions to a

finite number of steps.

finite conv

9. Main theorem. Let K be a convex body in d-dimensional eu-
clidean space containing in its interior the hypersphere 24(r) of radius r
and center at the origin (r <1). Let us always consider the lattice of
points with integral coordinates. Then if K faals to contain in its in-
terior those lattice points (other than the origin) in a second sphere
Ta(Ca/riY), then it will contain 1m its interior no lattice points at all
except the origin. In fact K will then lie entirely within the second
sphere. :

ProOF. We shall establish the value Ca=24"'dl'((d+1)/2)x— (4-1/2,

We let (x;) be an arbitrary point outside of Z4(r), that is, we let
S«=R?>r? and we join this point to its negative by a line, namely
A(x;), through the origin. We let II(x;) be the (d—1)-dimensional
hyperplane through the origin and perpendicular to this line, and we
let Z4_; (r; x;) be the intersection of this plane with the solid sphere
24(r). For our immediate purposes we define k(r; x:) as the (solid)
cone formed by the segments joining each point of Z4_; (7; x:) with
(x;); and for later purposes we define K(r; x;) as the (solid) cone with
spherical base formed by joining with (x;) each point of Z4(r). Now
K(r; x;) will prove useful when we seek the best Cg, since this solid
is a minimal body which any convex body K must contain in order
to contain both Z4(r) and (x). For our immediate purposes, we need
only note that the convex body K will (easily) contain k(r; ¥:) and
that the latter body has the very handy value wq_;#9-'R/d for its
volume, where w;=7*2/T(1+%/2), the k-dimensional volume of the
unit sphere in 2 dimensions.

ON FINITENESS CONDITIONS FOR A CONVEX BODY 545

We now note that «(; x:) will contain a lattice point (not the origin)
if R= Ca/r?~". This is a simple consequence of Minkowski’s theorem
on convex bodies [3, p. 60]. For the body formed by the union of
k(r; x:) and k(r; —x;) is symmetric and has volume not less than 2¢.
Hence there would have to be a lattice point. (not the origin) in each
of the two symmetric halves. From this the theorem follows easily.

3. Best constant. The preceding estimates can be improved
slightly. For instance we may take into account the fact that the
convex bodies, (7; x:) and its integra] translates, can not pack space
more densely than do the (d—1)-dimensional spheres (which are pre-
cisely their intersections with planes parallel to II(x;)). Then we im-
mediately obtain an improvement of Cy to C}= Cwa_yy$-/32-(¢-D
(where vy? is the maximum euclidean distance separating the clos-
est points of any d-dimensional lattice of determinant unity). But
using even the lower estimates [2, pp. 23-24] on y4_,;, we find the
improvement is not substantial, that is, as d—«, log Cs~log C/
~(d/2) log d.

Going in the other direction we can show that there is a best con-
stant for Ca as r—0. To recapitulate, our main theorem was deduced
from Minkowsk1's theorem. It could also have been deduced from the
simultaneous approximation theorem, as the remaining proof will sug-
gest, but the constant Ci would not have been as good. The converse
of Minkowski’s theorem, or the Minkowski-Hwlaka theorem [4], is
inapplicable since the problem is not affine invariant. The converse
of the simultaneous approximation theorem, or (essentially) Perron’s
transferal principle [2, p. 67], is, however, applicable and we shall
now look to it for a proof that a best Cas, which we shall call Cj,
exists.

For the calculation of the best constant, we take a minimal con-
vex body, which is “evasive” of lattice points, namely K*
=K(r; p8:/(Z67)'/?), reaching to distance p from the origin in the
direction (6;(=1), 8s, - - - , 84). The 6; are chosen, from the Perron
transferal principle, to span (say) a real algebraic field of degree d
(for convenience, 0 <6; <1). Then a constant gs (called Cain [2]) will
exist with the property that “the forms | px — px, for 2 Sk <d, admit
a simultaneous approximation no better than (gap/@=")-1,” that is,
for p> Pi(e), the inequality | pf — pi] = ((gat+€)p)/ ?)~* will hold
for some % depending on p, and ¢, and satisfying 25k Sd.

We now let p increase from 7 until it reaches the first value po for
which K* has a lattice point (p:) on its surface. If we took r small

“enough (<7o(e)) then this lattice point would satisfy the inequality

p1>Pa(€) by the irrationality of the 6; when k>1. If we let §
= [Zos(p 8 — 201" 2/(26%)1? denote the distance from the lattice

point (ps) to the line A(8:), then easily > 98 (since 7 is the maximum
distance from a point of K*toA(6:)), and 60> [pY @=D(g,4€) (267) 1/2].
Therefore using the trivial relationships po= (ZpH)V2 =p; and 26; <d,
we find po> [(gate) a—14(d-1/2pd—1]-1 This gives us a distance that the
convex body K* can attain without containing an interior lattice

point other than the origin. Thus it easily follows that Cd = CY,

=(g LdU2)~ED.
Even using Very simple methods, we can improve ca somewhat; but

still, on the basis of present information on ga[2, p. 72], we can show
only that as d—%, log C;/(d log d) lies between 1/2 and —1. At

any rate, the function Ca/re=% appearing in the main theorem, is
seen to contain the best possible power of 7.
