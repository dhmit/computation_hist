Research in Electrocardiography

HE application of laws which govern

the flow of electric currents in tissues

to the excitation of heart muscle has
led to the discovery that many fundamental
principles of electrocardiography were clearly
formulated long before facilities to express
them by experimental means had become
available. Lately, the easy access to electro-
cardiographic instrumentation has occasion-
ally reversed the process of deductive reason-
ing. There 1s a tendency in electrocardiographic
research to adopt rules made to fit experi-
mental observations and to consider geometric
teaching devices as scientific proof. It should
be stressed that (a) the primary gathering of
experimental data, both from human subjects
and from animals, is a necessary prerequisite
to the advance of clinical electrocardiography,
and that (b) it is equally essential to engage in
the analysis of mathematical concepts for the
solution of practical problems. Both types of
research are necessary if empiricism is to be
replaced by scientific knowledge. The paper
by the Wilson school* on the precordial electro-
cardiogram may be cited as a classical example
of the first kind; Bayley’s paper® on certain
applications of modern electrocardiographic
theory, as an example of the second. In the
former, experimental information related to
clinical electrocardiography is presented with
a minimum amount of speculative background,
in the second, certain relevant aspects of theo-
retical physics are analyzed to formulate an

electrocardiographic theory using a minimum
of illustrative experiments.

The analysis of the form of the action cur-
rent of the heart has to consider three funda-
mental research areas, (a) the electrochemical
properties of the excitable cell and cell aggre-
gates which represent the source of the action
current, (b) the fluid volume conductor
properties of the thorax (a structure of ques-
tionable homogeneity) and (¢) the influence
of the boundary of the thorax (skin and
subcutaneous tissues) which defines the con-
ductor (b) as one of limited dimensions and
may, thereby, alter the distribution of elec-
trical currents at the body surface. Corre-
sponding to these three areas, three outstanding
contributions may be cited, all published
before 1890,'* which offered a mathematical
treatment for these basic components of
electrocardiographic analysis. Knowledge of
their existence, if not a detailed study, should
be of importance to those interested in the
bioelectric phenomena of the heart.

THe ELecrrROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF THE
[KxcrraBrLe CELL

A hypothesis advanced by Bernstein® as-
sumes that the source of bioelectric currents
1s located at the boundary between the inside
of the cell and its surroundings, and that this
boundary has the characteristics of a semi-
permeable membrane. Across the membrane
some ions pass freely, others are held back

escaped general attention. Nelson’s paper is
of fundamental interest since it shows a
method for solving boundary problems in
electrocardiography, at least for straight line
boundaries and for boundaries of a circular
plane. Tt should be added that Thomson car-
ried the problem further for the solution of
the effects of boundaries of a sphere, but it
was W. M. Hicks" who apparently first pub-
lished a complete analysis of spherical bound-
aries in 1880.1 According to Hicks, the image
of an electrical source X located within a
sphere of radius R at a distance a from its

center 1s a source X! at the distance —, and

a line of sinks reading from the Image source
X' to infinity.

A single observation may be cited which
points to the practical significance of considera-
tions of this kind: A zero point of reference,
the ideal position for an ideal indifferent elec-
trode, has always been considered to be lo-
cated halfway between the source and sink
of a dipole. It is not so located if the boundary
is taken into account.

This brief discussion should bring to mind
again the fact that the basic laws of electricity
developed during the 19th century are ap-
plicable to a theory of electrocardiography
today. As in other disciplines, research in this
field has its roots in the past from which

APPENDIX

Excerpt from Silvanus P. Thompson: The Life

of William Thomson, Baron Kelvin of Largs.

London, MacMillan, 1910, vol. 1, p. 151-150.

The doctrine of electric images, several times
mentioned. seems to have been in Thomson's mind
before he left Cambridge; but it developed ¥self
with surprising rapidity during his sojourn in Paris,
and shortly after his return to Cambridge he com-
municated it to Liouville in three letters, the sub-
stance of which was printed in the Journal de
mathematiques in October 1845 and June 1846.
This method, which even now is not adequately
appreciated, is so elegant, and so fruitful in its
applications, that it merits some attention from
the scientific reader. It furnishes a most cogent
illustration of the value of that which has been
aptly termed the cross-fertilization of the sciences,
the value of introducing into one branch of science
the concepts that have arisen in another. To explain
the concept of electric images, it may be well to
begin with a concrete and familiar case of optical
images. very one knows that if a candle 1s placed
in front of an ordinary plane mirror, the image of
it, seen by looking into the mirror, is, as it were,
another candle of equal size and brightness with the
first, situated apparently exactly as far behind the
mirror as the real candle is in front. In fact, if the
mirror were to be removed from its frame, and a
second candle set in the position where the image
previously appeared, the amount of illumination
received at any given point in front of the mirror
from the two candles would be identical with the
amount received from the one candle and its image.
The limitations of the frame would prevent the
image, or the substituted candle, from being seen
from every direction. If the mirror be conceived to
be indefinitely extended, and its frame to be In-
finitely wide and high, these limitations would be
removed. If, instead of a plane mirror, a spherical
mirror or silver ball were substituted, the image of
a candle placed in front will appear to be a smaller
andle situated now within the spherical surface,
and at a distance behind the silvered face not equal
to the distance of the candle in front, but nearer to
the face. The apparent size and distance of this
image can be calculated by easy geometrical rules:
and again it will be true that if the mirror be re-
moved, and there be substituted an equivalent
smaller candle in the place where the image ap-
peared, the illumination at any point in front will
remain unaltered by such substitution.

Now, consider a small insulated conducting
body, such as a small metal sphere, charged with

positive electricity. If placed in the middle of a
large empty room it will project its influence into
the space around it mm radial straight lines, acting
as though the electric charge upon 1t were concen-
trated at its centre. Now suppose a very large sheet
of copper, or some other good conductor of elec-
tricity, to be placed at the side of the charged
sphere at a short distance from 1t. It an be shown
that, for all points of the space in front of this
sheet, the sheet acts as an electric mirror; the
effects in this region being the same as if, in the
absence of the sheet, there had been a second
charged sphere placed exactly as far behind the
sheet as the actual sphere is in front of it. But there
is this curious peculiarity, that in order to procure
an equivalent effect this ‘image sphere’ would have
to be charged with an equal quantity of negative
electricity. The ‘image’ of a positive charge is a
negative one, and vice versa. If we suppose the
sheet removed and the ‘image’ replaced by a small
actual sphere, negatively electrified to an equal
degree, the space between and around the spheres
will be traversed by a system of curved lines of
electric force emanating from one and terminating
at the other. If we remove the second sphere and
replace the sheet, the lines of force in front, emanat-
ing from the positive sphere, will still curve round
exactly as before until they reach the sheet. The
sheet will, in fact, receive (by induction) a negative
charge: and this charge will be distributed over its
surface according to a certain law, the density of
the charge being strongest at the point of the
surface nearest to the sphere, and weaker over the
surface outwards from this center. This case illus-
trates not merely the conception of electric images,
but also the much more refined conception which
Thomson had arrived at in 1842 (and Green before
him) of the replacing of an electrified body or point
by an electric charge distributed over a surface in
such a way as to be in equilibrium. If, to take
another case, the positive electric point charge 1s
placed in front of a large uninsulated metal sphere,
to act as a spherical mirror, there will again be an
electric ‘image’ formed within the sphere, and this
‘image’ will be negative; but its distance behind
the reflective surface will not be equal to the dis-
tance of the electric ‘object’ in front; and though
simple rules can be given for finding the position
and magnitude of the electric ‘image’, these rules
differ from those for the finding of the conjugate
images in optics. An electrical image is, then, an
electrified point, or system of points, on one side
of a surface, which would produce on the other
side of that surface the same electrical action which
the actual electrification of that surface really does
produce. The method of images can be extended to
many applications. For instance, if an electrified
point is situated between two parallel conducting
sheets, not only will it generate a primary ‘image’

out, is the analogue of the optical toy alled the

that are not small are brought near to one another
reacting on one another’s charges so that the dis.
tribution of charges over the spheres is d'storted
out of uniformity, the distribution of the charges
and the resulting force of attraction or repulsion
