Attn: WORK,

i informed Ur, E. Po Little during the eerly part
of the summer that the activity on this contract woulé not
pe initiated in full volume on June 1, 1832 because of the
personnel procurene nt problems This, in pert, explains the
delay in the submission of this first guarterly report.
The other reason 18 simply that there are over 300 pages

ir the report and ils preparation was an exceedingly timew
consuming task, At any rate, one reproducible (a transparant
cgalid) and four coples are being submitted under separete

represented hy this report was performed ssing funds of this
contract. ¢pecificelly, this thesis recresents several years'
work, and it is only the final stages of it which were performed

during this quarterly period.

Attached you will find an abstract of this thesis
repert which will give you an idea of its content. I hepe
this will be helpful to you,

in conclusion, I wish to stale that the succeeding
progress reports will not be as tardy as this one. Specifie
cally, Luarterly Report Fe, 2 Is tc »¢ submitted to the
printer on December 1st, and you should receive it as soon
as the succesding publication technicalities will permit,

Very truly vours,

This report is primarily concerned with the solution
of uoundary-value preblems by means of autcmetice computing
equipment (both enalogue and digital), Specifically, in
addition to the familiar desk calculator, the fellewing
digital computers were used in this study: the type 602A
Electromechanical Calculator, the type 604 Electronic
Calculator, the Card Frogrammed Talculator, and the M,I1.T,
ihirlwind Computer, The anfilogue studies were obtained by
uga of the M,1.T. Rockefeller Differential Analyzer,

This study is primarily concerned with the sclution
of ordinary differentisl equations in which certain boundary
conditions are specified at two or more values of the
Independent variaple, Such problems are generally called
boundary-value problems, It is clearly evident that the
solution of such problems is inherently mere difficult than
the solution of initialevalue problems in which 211 conde
tions are specified at one point, The particular problems
studied are further complicated by the fact that their
solutions are required over an infinite range which cone
tains regions of nen-gnalyticity.

A computational philosophy is presented which empha-
sizes that a machine wust Le evaluated on & firm engineering
and economic basige-a basis which must include the entire
cemputetional procedure, An evaluation is given of the.
relative advantages and limitations of the five computers
used In thls study. A fair svaluation must include the

time for: problem preparation, numericel analysis,
programming, coding, machine setup, machine solution,
checking, and se forth, The accuracy and cest of 8 particu
lar sciution must also ve Included,

This report else illustrates the manner in which the
techniques for solving simultanecus linear slgebralc szqua-
tions are apnlied tec the seluticn of the boundary value
proclem, A detalled description of the entire compute

tional procedure characteristic to each cesputer is aiven
in an associated Appendix,
