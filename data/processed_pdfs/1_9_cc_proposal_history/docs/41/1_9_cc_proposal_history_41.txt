Memo to: President James R. Killian, Jr.

From: Professor Philip M. Morse
Subjects Proposed Computer Training and Research Center, Outline
Sr and Problems ARF | a

 

1. Present Situation - Two separate installations (Whirlwind and
IBM, located apart and with separate staffs. Present budget
(approximate, including 40 per cent overhead charge on salaries):

A. Whirlwind (excluding Lincoln use, but including
full-time programming research staff) g175,000 per year

B. IBM (excluding machines and staff used for MIT
administrative services but including rentals
for rest of IBM equipment) . 85,000 per year

C. Funds to support research assistants learning
use of machines and aiding in programming 70,000 per year

Present Total $330,000

B 1s now financed by charging those DIC projects which can afford
it and giving the rest of the time free for class training and
Thesis research. C is now financed by a grant from ONR which will
terminate in June 1956. 4 is now financed in part by charging
those DIC projects which can afford it and, for the rest, by an
ONR contract which also terminates on June 1, 1956.

Disadvantages of Present Arrangement - Two group, separate loca-
tion, w some duplication o man-power and considerable loss in
effectiveness. All present equipment going out of date, will not
satisfy Institute needs in two years (see previous memo, attached).

Proposed Reorganization - The proposed new center for Computer Re-

search and Training would be built around an IBM 704 computer and
auxlliary equipment, to be donated by IBM. IBM would use it for

two of the four daily shifts (the night ones) and we would have

full use for the other two shifts (about 80 hours a week working
time). This equipment would have more capabilities than our present
two sets of machines and the two shifts should take care of our
educational and research needs for several years to come. The
budget for this center would be approximately:

D. IBM Rental (which includes provision for
operators and maintenance personnel provided by
IBM) at commercial rates, for comparison g400,000 per year


"De

E. Full-time staff for programming, research and
assistance in laboratory classes (one adminis-
trative head, one research head, fourteen staff,
salaries plus usual 40 per cent overhead, plus
travel, etc.) $150,000 per year

F. Funds to support research assistants, who would
help full-time staff and also learn machine use
(including usual 40 per cent overhead on
salaries) 70,000 per year

G. Costs for power, equivalent rental for space, ete.,
which might be charged against the 40 per cent
overhead included In B and C ?

(Budget for special equipment and staff used by MIT for adminis-
trative purposes, registration, alumni, ete. - $17,000 per year -
is not included here. Presumably this activity and its budget
would continue unchanged.)

Power requirements, including power for air conditioning required
by equipment - 125 KW

Space requirements for equipment, staff and classroom - 8,000 square
feet working area

D would be donated by IBM. Part of E and F could be obtained
from grants from ONR, NSF and possible industrial grants, but it
is unlikely that more than 860,000 a year can be raised this way,
unless some presently unknown source 18 uncovered. The rest of
budgets E and F (about 160,000 per year) could be raised by
charging those DIC projects which can afford it, as we are doling
now. If we charged for machine time at $250 per hour (less than
"commercial rates), we would need to “sell” about 700 of our
avallasble 4,000 machine hours per year, which would not cut too
deeply into our educational and research agtivity. A survey of
the present computing services to DIC projects indicates that we
will probably have encugh demand from projects able to pay so we
would not have to sell computer time outside MIT, unless govern-
ment support for DIC projects falls off considerably. This system
of charges would not be unfair to the DIC projects, because if
budgets E and F were supported entirely by direct grants, we would
use the center entirely for tralning and research, would not serve
these projects at all and they would have to rent thelr own machines
or buy time outside. It would be preferable to do it this way, of
course, 1f we could raise all the funds for E and F without having
to sell time.

Since some of the staff of E would be spending part of their
time teaching courses on machine use and supervising laboratory
work on the machines, possibly part of this budget should be charged

to departmental budgets. Also possibly special fellowships and
other grants could be obtained to help with F.

Space Problems - To house this equipment, staff and space for
classes, we would need 8,000 square feet working area, at least
twice as much space as our present IBM installation (item B) is
using. There are several possible ways of getting this space (no
order of preference is implied in the following 1ist)!

1. Take more space in Building 20. (Probably not possible.)

2. Build a new building to house it. (Not very expensive
construction, but would need air conditioning.) i:

5. See if IBM could provide space for it in a possible new
building they are considering building in Cambridge for
thelr own sales crgenization (not feasible unless the IBM
building were on or very close to the campus). The Barta
Building, now housing Whirlwind, would not be desirable
and, 1n addition, Whirlwind will be used by Lincoln Labs.
for several years after we relinquish it.

Participation by other Universities - If MIT can give our sister
colleges in New England some benefits of the Computing Center, 1%
would be a little easier to explain why we got such preferential
treatment. Even without the desire of IBM for us to do 80, it
probably would be good policy to extend an offer of help, even to
The extent of having a coordination committee of representatives
from some of the other institutions. The cooperation would not
amount to much unless the other institution contributed actively,
which would mean in practice having at least one of their staff
at the center at least half the time. In fact, it wight be
appropriate to say that any institution which wishes to partici- |
pate actively should contribute directly to the support of budgets
E and F, either by cash payments or contribution of personnel.

Possible Timing - IBM indicates that it will not have a 70) avail-
able for us until about January 1957. Until that time the present
arrangements given in items A and B can continue, these groups
getting thelr funds by charging the DIC projects. Since MIT is
already giving courses on machine use, IBM has offersd to give

us a 60 per cent educational discount on the machines in item B,
until the time when the TOY will be sent to us. This will ease
the budget pressure on B. Item C will have to be discontinued on
June 1956, unless machine earnings have increased sufficiently for
Some money to be avallable to hire graduate assistants. .

In this transition period the two groups A and B are being
coordinated, so they can be combined into one group, when the new
equipment comes, with minimum loss of efficiency.

The main question requiring decision in the near future is
that of housing. The present plans and the donation of the egquip-
ment by IBM cannet be implemented unless the 8,000 square feet of
working space is available for the proposed Computing Center by or
before January 1957.
