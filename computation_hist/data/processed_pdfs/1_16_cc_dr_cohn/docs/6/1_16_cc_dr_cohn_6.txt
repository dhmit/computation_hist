THE RIEMANN FUNCTION FOR *u/dxdy + H(z + y)u = 0

By Harvey Conn

1. Introduction. Some interesting hyperbolic differential equations can be
represented in the form

(1) 9u/dx dy + H(x + yu = 0.

An instance of (1) as the wave equation in space was first considered by Euler
[5; 480-81]. Instances of this equation in the field of differential geometry
(Laplace) are given in Darboux [3; 52], and instances in the field of compressible
hydrodynamics were considered by Riemann [6; 173] for linear flows and by A.
Steichen (see Ackaret [1; 317]) for plane flows.

We shall concern ourselves entirely with the evaluation of the Riemann
function of (1), by means of which Riemann showed how to solve (1) for given
boundary conditions. The Riemann function, despite its crucial importance,
seems to have been found in closed form only in the special cases H(r) = —\
and H(r) = —A(X + 1)/r°, X\ constant. Moreover these cases are just those
solved by Riemann, who, in turn, has even been anticipated to some extent by
Euler [4]! Undoubtedly, the Picard iteration process and its existence proof
for the Riemann function in general, drew attention away from the evaluation
of this function. Nevertheless, the fact that the Riemann function has been
evaluated only for these two simple cases restricts the number of physical
situations to which equation (1) can correspond and still remain simple enough
to permit solution in closed form by use of a Riemann function.

It will therefore be our purpose to consider the possibility of finding the
Riemann function for a greater variety of functions H(r). The methods will
be twofold. First of all we shall use a specialized artifice to obtain the
Riemann function in closed form for a few types of H(r), namely H(r) =
—AA + Du*/sinh® u(r + ») (A, p, » constant), and some of its limiting cases,
H(r) = —X exp ur, —A(\ + 1)/7°, and —X. Then we shall consider a certain
Fourier integral expression for the Riemann function of (1) with arbitrary H(r).
This latter expression is due to Riemann, who derived it in a heuristic manner.
We shall also indicate a rigorous proof of Riemann’s expression, since this long-
neglected expression is of potential importance with the further development of
analysis.

2. Some properties of the Riemann function. For later reference we shall
summarize some existence and uniqueness theorems as obtained through the
Picard iteration process (see Courant-Hilbert [2; 317-322]). For equation (1),

This series is seen to be convergent and to represent a solution to (3). Equation
(3), or system (2), also has a unique solution, or otherwise expressed, any solution

cally.

These statements are made because the iteration process will motivate the
rest of the paper.

RIEMANN FUNCTION 299

We observe that (5) is an ordinary differential equation of second order with
only one initial condition. This, however, is natural since (5a) has only one
solution regular at U = 0. For if we were to expand both U and f(U; 2 y')
into powers of (x — 2’) and (y — %’), we should find that they each begin with
the term (z — 2°) (y — ¥")H(z' + y’), whence f(U; 2’, y') = U + a(2’, y')U? +

Thus at U = 0, equation (5a) has both characteristic exponents zero,
which implies that (5a) has a solution R, regular and equal to unity at U = 0
and a solution R, with a logarithmic singularity at /' = 0. Thus (5) uniquely
determines a Riemann function R = R,(U; 2, y'). )

Unfortunately only very few cases are covered by this artifice. The condition
that the Jacobian of (U/dx) (dU /dy)H™" and U with respect to x and y vanish
can be regarded as an identity in 2” and y’ for any given z and 3. This identity
in turn leads to an ordinary differential equation if we develop H into power
series about the point » = x + y. Then the identity implies the vanishing of
an infinite series in the variables 2’, y" with coefficients expressible in terms of
H(r) and its derivatives. Since the coefficients of such a series must vanish,
we obtain an ordinary differential equation for H(r), namely

d/dr[H'd°H /dr* — 3/2(dH/Hdr)’] = 0,

which has as its general solution

(6) Hr) = —A\ + Dp’ /sinh® u(r + »)

where A, u, v are constants. This is the value of H(r) for which we shall derive
a Riemann function via (5).

In obtaining the Riemann function corresponding to the value of H(7) given
in (6), we find that

U=—=N\N+1)log (1+ V),
where

sinh u(x — 2’) sinh u(y — ¥)
sinh u(r + y + ») sinh u(x’ + y" +»)

In terms of V equation (5) becomes

Vl — V)&R/AV: + (1 — 2V)dR/AV + AA + DR = 0

R=1 at V=0,
and its solution, a hypergeometric function, is the Riemann function corre-
sponding to H(r) in (6), namely,

(7) Ri, y;2",y) = F0 + \, =X; 1; V).

The form of H(r) in (6) is seen to have a few simpler limiting cases. First
of all, we can change A to A exp » and let » — =, obtaining in the limit H(r) =

previous values of H(r) yield the special cases H(r) = —A(\ + 1)/(r + b)?
and Ha) = =X respectively. #08

In these special cases, we can perform the limiting process (of confluence)
and find that when H(r) = —A\ exp u7, (7) becomes

Likewise (8) yields the Riemann function for H(r) = —\ when v is replaced hy
its limit — A(z — @)(y — ¥)- :
"Thus the Riemann function is found in closed form when H(r) is the rather
versatile function —A(A + 1)u’/sinh® u(r 4 »).

4. Riemann’s Fourier integral expression. Perhaps a more promising method
of finding Riemann functions is one mentioned by Riemann. By changing
the variables of (1) tor = x + y and s = = — y and separating the new variables,
Riemann solved a class of boundary value problems by means of a Fourie
superposition. On comparing this solution with the one that would have heen
obtained by using the Riemann function, Riemann [6; 179-181] arrived at 4
heuristic result which we now state in the following form:

If we let

(9) R* = 1 [ exp tk(s — s")W(r,r’"; k) dk

where W(r, vr’; k) 1s defined by the ordinary differential equation

d’W/dr* + [k* + HP)]W = 0
(10)
Ww = 0, dW /dr = 1 at r=r'

)

then, changing to the old variables, we find R* satisfies the relation

(11) R* = 3sgn(x — 2’) + sgn(y — ¥)]|R(z, y; 2’, y').

| We can express W in terms of well-known functions only in a few cases, for
instance where H(r) = —X or —A(\ + 1)/7°. In these cases W takes the values
(12a) sin(r — )(k* — N/K — N)?

and

(12b) dn(rr')! Im[H,\Yy(| k | HAZ ( k | 7),

respectively. Further development of the theory of differential equations may
make enough functions “known” to permit IW to be expressible in closed form

found by our artifice and we could therefore regard (11) as the source of identities
relating exponential functions, Bessel functions, and hypergeometric functions.

We might mention these identities in passing, since they do not appear in
standard treatises on Bessel functions. By a suitable change in variables, the

identity (11) yields, when H(r) = —A,

where x, y, and z are positive and \ is real. The first of these identities could
be proved directly by separation of the integrand into exponentials and careful
deformation of the path of integration. The second identity does not seem to
invite such a direct approach.
