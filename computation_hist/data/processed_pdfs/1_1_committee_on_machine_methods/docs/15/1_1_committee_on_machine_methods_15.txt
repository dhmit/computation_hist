Minutes of the Fifteenth Meeting
of the '
Committee on Machine Methods of Computation

April 11, 1951

Pegseng ggesent: R. R. Everett, E. Feshbach, Z. Kopal, C. Lin,
P. M. Morse, and E. Reissner

The Committee ﬁiscussed several new proposals for research
assistantships for the program for next year. The Mathematics
members reported that they had no further recommendations at
present, though there might be more to recommend later. Pro-
fessor Kopal reported that Leigha who had been offered an as—
sistantship, has taken a job elsewhere, and that Frazier has been
given a full—time job with Whirlwind. This, consequently, leaves
the one Electricel Engineering possibility, W. K. Taylor from
England, as still being on the list. Kopal hopes to hear from
him in the near future. The Physics Department reported that
Mr. Speisﬂan had taken a position elsewhere and proposed Leo
Sartori to take his place. This was approved by the Committee.

  

Morse reported the 2' a1 program for the Conference on Use
of Computing Machines in.1ndustry for May second and third.
After a short discussion on the methods of supervising the re-
search assistants next year, and on the supervision of Verzuh's
thesis, the Committee adjourned.

There will be a meeting of the Committee next Weﬁnesday,
April 18, at 10100 A.M., unless it turns out that there are no
anglications fer consideration.
