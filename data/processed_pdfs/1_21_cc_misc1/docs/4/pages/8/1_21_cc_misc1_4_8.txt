(2) Normal paradigmatic order for inflected words
will not be followed, but each will be listed regard-
less of form in order of appearance in the Institutes;

(3) Certain common words will be eliminated from the
Concordance proper, to cult bulk and costs, es=
pecially machine time and printing.

The computer-influenced portion of our task begins with the
selection of the character set which will be used in transferring
the text from its published format to a computer-readable medium.
The medium selected for this task is that of punched cards. The
card punch machine imposes certain limitations on the way we may
transcribe our text to punched cards as it has a rather limited
character set. This character set includes the twenty-six alpha-
betic symbols, the ten decimal digits, the period, the space, the
comma, and a few other business-oriented symbols such as the
dollar-sign, the percent-sign and the slash,

Symbols found in text materials such as the question mark,
exclamation point, colon, semi-colon, dash, etc., must be re-
presented on the punched cards in such a way that they may be en-
tered into the computer operations and emerge as part of the final
concordance, Other symbols which do not appear in the Latin
should not be precluded at this juncture if at all possible. These
include the hyphen and the normal accents of the western European
languages.,

A scheme has been devised to represent these two categories
of typographic symbols which may be encountered. The first cate-
gory is that of punctuation symbols and the second is that of charac-
ters which are parts of words. By using one of the business-oriented
symbols as a prefix followed by one of the thirty-six alphanumeric
characters to represent each of the desired typographic symbols we
can greatly expand our effective character set. By allocating a
separate prefixing symbol or symbols to each of the two categories
mentioned above, we will facilitate subsequent computer processing,

Once the character set has been agreed upon, we proceed to
the task of prescribing a format for the actual key-punching of the
