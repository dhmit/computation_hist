This report is primarily concerned with the solution
of uoundary-value preblems by means of autcmetie computing
squipment (both enalogue and digital)., Specifiealls, in
addition to the familiar desk calculster, the fellewing
digital computers were used in this study: the type 6024
Electromechanicel]l Calculator, the type 6504 Electironic
Calculator, the Card FProgrammed Taleulator, and the M,I1.T,
ihirlwindg Computer, The anfilogue studies were oblained by
uge Â¢f the M,1.T. Rockefeller Differential Analyzer,

This study is primarily concerned with the selution
of ordinary differentisl equations in which certain beundary
conditions are specified at twg or = values of the
Independent variaple, Such prodblems are generally called
boundary-value problems, It is clearly evident that the
soilution of such problems is inherently mere difficult than
the solution of initialevalue problems in which 211 condie
tions are specified at one point, The particulsar problems
stucdied are further complicated by the fact that their
solutions are reguired over an infinite range which cone
tains reglions of nern-gnalyticity.

A computational philesophy is presented which empha-
sizeg that & machine must bLe evaluatled on & firm engineering
and gcenomic basiseea haslis which must include the entire
computetional precedure, An evaluation iz given of the .
relative advantages and limitations of the five computers
used In thils studys A fair svaluation must include the

time for: problem preparaztion, numericel analysis,
programming, coding, machine setup, machine solution,
checking, and se forth., The accuracy and cest of 8 particue
lar scjution must alzo be Included,

This report salse iliustrates the manner in which the
techniques for solving simultanecus linecar slgebrale szquae~
tions are apirlied to the soluticn of the bouncary value

tional procedure characiteristic to each cemputer {s given
