Dr. Phillip Morse, Director

The Computation Center

Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Cambridge, Mass.

Dear Dr. Morse:

I certainly enjoyed my visit with you several weeks ago. I have
been studying considerably about computation centers, both before
and after my visit, but this was the first chance I had had to
see a first-rate operation close up.

The Vanguard of our IBM 650 has started to arrive and I gather
that the rest of the equipment is not too far behind. Conse-
quently, it behooves us to move with some dispatch in landing

a director. Our committee is to meet next week and I want to
place before them the name of the man you suggested to me. I
had such a very busy schedule in Pittsburgh after leaving Boston
that I did not have a chance to look him up. Nevertheless, if
my colleagues think well of him we will probably want to invite
him down for an interview at an early date.

 

I told Joe Morris the other day about our visit and how impressed
I was with the M.I.T. setup. He was real pleased to hear from
you again and I know that as we proceed with the center he will
want to visit your operation himself.

With kindest regards.

Sincerely yours,
