Commter. (scept those of the Lincoln Laboratory). will be
emu-cred by M.I.'I'.‘s comittee on Machine Methods of Computation.

5. Projects connected with ELL-0m! contracts will not be

it is definitely in the best interests of all concerned to
carry out their programs on Whirlwind.

8. Projects undertaken for outside sponsors. including 01m
prime contractors. will pay the established rate: for use of
the computer. It is the intention of the Committee on Machine
Computation that such projects he kent at a minimum.

9. It is recognized that the computer will continue to be used
for research in coding technicues. thesis work. class exercises.
