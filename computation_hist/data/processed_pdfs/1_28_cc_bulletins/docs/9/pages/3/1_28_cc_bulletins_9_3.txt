CC~143-1 An Edit Program for BCD Tapes, January 24, 1961 - A
program for producing e new or up-to-date BCD tape fiom the original
BCD tape and a deck of ALTER cards. A recoumeunded procedure for
altering and maintaining a large program or programming system in
symbolic form.

such as the size of matrices, etc., may be specified at loading time

Subprogram Changes

The following modifications to subpirograms on the library tape
have been made,

F2PM - Now disables all traps and has been corrected so that NAME
(ENTIRE) requests work properly. In addition, the output routines of
F2PM were modified speeding them up by about 40%.

(I1#S) and (STH) -~ Changes in these basic FMS output routines have
speeded them up by approximately 40%.

XSIMEQ and XDETR - Modified to set floating point underflows to
zero, New version also takes less space than old,

Open Files

When using the open files of subprogram decks in the Processing
Room, check the tab card preceding each subprogram set for the number
of cards you should have,

A list of the subprograms on the FMS library tape, the number of
locations they require and the subprograms in their transfer vector has
been compiled and is available in the Conrsulting Room, 26-153,
