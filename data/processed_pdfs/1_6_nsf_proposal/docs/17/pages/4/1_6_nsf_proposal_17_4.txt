Investigation of new techniques and applications of

linear programming, including procedures analogous to the methods
of steepest descent developed by Hestenes and Stiefel for the
solution of linear equations.

Computations of interest in pure mathematics:

Character table of selected characters of the
symmetric group. |

Checking congruences of interest in algebraic
number theory.

Further extension of factor tables and prime
number 1ists past 1012 via the sieve of Erastosthenes,
utilizing, say, Corbat√©'s new factoring program.

Coding of Tarski's decision method for elementary
algebra and geometry. Tarskl has shown that ele-
mentary algebra and geometry can be decided by a
computer. To implement this would be a task of
considerable magnitude, but 1t would 1llustrate the
logical capabilities of a computer to a degree not
heretofore done.

8. Techniques for achieving fully automatic computer
operation and logging. These will be investigated as an integral
part of the computing system. |
