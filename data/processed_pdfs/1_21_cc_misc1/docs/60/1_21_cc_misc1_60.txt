Dear Ray:

| | Just a postscript to our discussion of the

shortage of "mathematical physicists" and others who
are willing to stray from the "fasionabie line". I'm
sure you:'know the real reason for the shortage. No
department encourages anyone, faculty or student, to
stray from the "fashionable line" because 1t knows 1%
can't get financial support for anything away from the
"fashionable line". You know the sort of treatment
I've been getting from NSF and others in trying to get
support for an "inbetween field". Can you blame me if
I warn young students away from this rat-race?

- Yours,

Philip M. Morse
