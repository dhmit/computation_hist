T A SR Other relationships have been developed between thermal

conductivity and the compressibility (or elasticity) and den-
sity or related qualities such as hardness.® These depend on
the relation between the wave velocity, which is related to
the quantities concerned, and the conductivity as shown in
equation (10). For groups of compounds having the same
order of magnitude of mean free path (such as a group of
glasses and a group of halides), these relations appear to hold
qualitatively. The difficulty in testing them is that a compara-
tively wide divergence of values has been reported for the
conductivity of any pure material. For instance, the ther-
mal conductivity of aluminum oxide has been reported in the
' literature as having values of about 0.01,'° 0.02,5¢ (.03,
0.03,'* and 0.065" at 100°C., and this range of values is not
unusual. A major part of this difficulty has been the appar-
ent reluctance of most investigators to prepare samples of
high purity and low porosity for measurement: most values

occurs in Cr-Al,O; cermets where the addition of metal and
consequent formation of a Cr.0;-Al,0; solid solution serves
to decrease the over-all conductivity below that of pure
AlO3.'"  As far as the authors are aware, only one system
(KCI-KBr) of solid solutions of ionic materials has been
studied and this below room temperature only.>® In this
system the conductivity decreased rapidly with the addition
of foreign atoms, as is shown in Fig. 2. For the two
temperatures (0°C. and —190°C.) investigated for KCI-
KBr solid solutions the addition of impurity followed

i.e.,

The importance of solid solutions would seem to justify fur-
ther work to define more closely the effects found and the re-
liability of Matthiessen's rule over a wider temperature range
and for other compositions.

Y% MgO could be added to BeO with no change in the rela-
tive conductivity from that of pure BeO.

A refractory body may be considered as a combination of
one or more solid phases and an air phase (pores). Equations
for the effect of porosity on thermal conductivity have beern
developed by Eucken® and Russell'®; although different in
form they lead to essentially identical results—that the con-
ductivity will decrease almost linearly with the fraction pores
as long as the solid phase 1s the continuous phase (which may
be assumed for most ceramic bodies with the exception of in-
sulating brick), whereas a high curvature is to be expected
when the pores are continuous.

No complete data are available for the thermal conductiv-
ity of well-defined systems. The relations developed should
apply identically to electrical conductivity, however, and
have been found to hold very well for emulsions, as shown in
Fig. 3.

Data for a serics of diaspore brick (from 30 to 709% po-
rosity) indicate a linear effect up to about 800°C., as do other
data in the literature. Data for temperatures above 800°C.
are not available, and no data are available for which the
thermal conductivity of the solid phase has been separately

The effect of grain size on the conductivity of solid ceramic
materials has not been thoroughly investigated. Eucken
and Kuhn®® found a very definite decrease in conductivity
of marble compared with a single crystal of calcite, and re-
ported that the thermal resistance due to the grain boundaries
was constant at 0°C. and at . —190°C. Their results with
alkali halides were inconclusive, and no other data for ceramic
materials are known to be available. Several investigators
have found a large effect for the thermal resistance of metallic
grain boundaries.

V. Effect of Temperature on Thermal Conductivity

The variation of thermal conductivity with temperature is
known to be considerable for many materials; consequently
the temperature of measurement and of application must be
carefully specified. In general the results of various investi-
gators for any one material have shown much closer agree-
ment on the effect of temperature than on the absolute values
obtained (as is indicated in Fig. 1).

For crystalline materials, various theoretical treatments of
the effect of temperature on thermal conductivity have been
attempted. The first of these was presented by Debye in
1914.4 The equation for conductivity being
