I am not quite sure from your letter whether you
are asking me to write part of your chapter or not, or whether
you are asking if I could give you some information on the use
of digital computers in games, if you could figure some way of
getting this information from me with a minimum amount of
trouble on the part of both. If you are looking for specific
examples I am sure that the group at Rand and the correspond-
ing group at ORO have programmed more specific examples than
anyone else in the country. I am sure that if you visited
elther place you could get a fair amount of material to
bolster your chapter. I am also quite sure that to expect to
get such material by mail would involve an inordinate amount
of time on the part of the Rand or the ORO people or else
would result in worthless information unless you are a
specialist in this field yourself.

I have done a considerable amount of general think-
ing along these lines and have been instrumental in getting
some of the work started at Rand and at ORO and elsewhere.

We have done a few cases of industrial interest on the
machines available at the Institute and we expect to do a
great deal more, If you were here, if I had the time and if
you had the backgrourdof the Rand or other special experience,
I might be able to add some general thoughts to what you had
already collected.

I am not sure this would be worth a trip across the
country for you. If you feel it is, please write me again.

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse
