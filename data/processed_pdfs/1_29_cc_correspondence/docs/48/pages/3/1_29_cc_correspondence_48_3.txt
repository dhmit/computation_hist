Where: A is the FWA of the coefficient matrix, stored by columns,

B is ths dimension.,

C is the FWA of 2n X n consecutive registers, separated from
X,A,D and E, which msy be used by the program for temporary

"“Qﬁ:ﬁ:éﬁ; Contentes of these registers will be restored.

D is the FWA of the right-hend side.

E is the FWA of a set of B single-register flosting-point numbers,
the i-th number being an estimate of the meXimum megnitude of
error in any element of the i-th row of the coefficient matrix,
Thess numbers are stored in every second register, and are
undisturbed,

Obe - In addition to thé registérs mentioned above, the 3n+3 registers following
the coefficient metrix are destroyed, COMMON through COMMON+7 is required,

Dc. Error stops may occur in the following locetions:
