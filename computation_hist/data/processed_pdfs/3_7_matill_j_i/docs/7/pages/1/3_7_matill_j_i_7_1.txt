Dear Phil,

On January 9 and 10, 1958, we will be entertaining about
150 college publicity, publications, and public relations
people for the annual meeting of the New England District,
American College Public Relations Association.

I assume that essentially all of the New England colleges
and universities which are participating in the Computation
Center will be represented. This being so, would you be
willing to arrange a meeting of publicity people from these
schools, to see the computer and to hear about the program
for cooperating New England colleges? This I assume would
include a visit to the computer and a brief discussion of
the program — together with some examples of work which is
underway through the cooperative program.

We will haVe some time lﬁiﬁLin the morning of January 9 {

and again that afternoon; or we could put this one on the_,

program for Friday morning, January 10.

Would you be good enough to discuss this one with your

colleagues — and in due course let me know what you con—
elude?
