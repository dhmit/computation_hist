THE MasSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, an institution devoted to the advancement and development of science and
technology, was founded in 1861 by William Barton Rogers, a distinguished natural scientist and its furst president. Today
with an enrollment of 5,300 students, M.I.T.’s graduate and undergraduate schools offer twenty-one programs of study, with
many oplions, in the fields of science, engineering, architecture, city and regional planming, industrial management, and the
related humanities. M.1.T. s justly proud of its record of leadership in these fields, having proneered in the establishment

of such courses of instruction as architecture; electrical, chemical, aeronautical, and samtary engineening; meteorology; food

te"(hmn!ugy; and naval architecture and marnne engineering.

’ ——In general, though with some exceptions, the Institute’s educational plant s confined lo the East Campus (the area

east of Massachusetls Avenue) while living and recreational facilities are on the West Campus. The main educational group,
centering around the Greal Court, is a single continuous structure, but il 1s divided for convemience into numbered sections
referred to as “buildings.” Rooms are numbered according to building and location in the bwilding. The first figure indi-
cates the building, the second, the floor, and the last two, the room. Thus Room 10-250 means Buildine 10. sec"on(/ floor.

A SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT
THE KRESGE AUDITORIUM AND
THE M.1.T. CHAPEL

The Kresge Auditorium and the Chapel are units in a center on
the west side of Massachusetts Avenue devoted to student life out-
side the classrooms. Construction of a student building is
contemplated.

The Auditorium is unique in that its dome, a triangular curved

slab of concrete with a load of 1,500 tons, is supported by the three
corners. These rest on massive buttresses. The dome represents

one-eighth of the surface of a sphere.

The concrete at the top of the dome is only 3-1/2 inches thick.
In proportion to its area, it is thinner than the shell of an egg.

Layers of glass wool and cinder concrete on the dome insulate

material, acrylic plastic mixed with Fiberglas, beach sand and
other materials, used for the first time on any building.

Interior walls of the Auditorium are not connected structurally
with the dome, permitting it to expand and contract with the
temperature. The space between the dome and walls, as much as
six inches. is filled by rubber gaskets. On the left is a choir loft
and on the right a loft for the Walter Holtkamp organ. The stage
curves outward to provide visibility from all parts of the Audi-
torium. and curtains move on curved tracks. Acoustical design was
so carefully worked out that a pin dropped on the stage can be
heard in any seat.

Responsible in part for the good acoustics are the “clouds,”
rectangular baffles suspended from the dome which reflect the
<ound and also serve to mask air conditioning and lighting equip-
ment. Refrigeration machinery which cools the Auditorium during
the summer also serves to make ice on the adjacent skating rink
during the winter.

The Auditorium was one of the first buildings wired for tele-
vision broadcasting. There are points at which as many as six TV
