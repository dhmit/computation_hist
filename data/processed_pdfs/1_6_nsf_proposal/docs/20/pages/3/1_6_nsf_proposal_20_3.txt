put out a combined progress report. In some published papers,
credit could be given to one organization alone; in others, credl% .
would go to both. Bookkeeping would be gsomewhat more complicated,
but since most of the expense would be for salaries, 1ittle for
permanent equipment, this could be done. It probably would be
necessary tq have the usual government overhead for both contracts.

The proposed budget asked of each agency for 1956-57 is
given below. The corresponding amounts for the following two years

wguld be g45,000 for 1957-58 and #50,000 for 1958-59, as jndicated
above.

Propeosed Research; Possible Initial Directions of Investigation:

1. Investigation of structure and Syntax of input
janguages; Â¢the possibilities of coding directly. in mathematical,
logical or business language.

2o Development of routines capable of translating from
algebralc notation to computer code and vice versa, including
possibly automatic selection of numerical techniques and auvtomatic
error analysis. <

N Development of numerical analytilc techniques particu-
jarly suitable for use by digital computers; such as more general
expansions, truncated Chebyshev polyncmlals sums for 2imulating
standard functions by a common block of instructions but small
separate blocks of coefficients and cycle counters and methods of
gutomatic determination of best grid spaciling, py trial plus
Richardson extrapolation or other means,

nL_  Investigation of Monte Carlo technigues for large
problems.

5., Extension and/or improvement of present techniques
for communication between machine and operator and for the more
flexible control of machine operation, including possible improve-
ments in 1nput-output equipment.
