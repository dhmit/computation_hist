Dear Dr. Leone :

_ I am returning your questionnaire on free machine time. as
it does not seem to be applicable in our case. The IBM 704 installed
here at the Institute is primarily tor. the Universities all!“ lnzland
and is not available for work originating eluvhere or for industriol
‘or military work. -

I think probably the background of the organization here
and the arrangements under which it works can lost easily be obtained
iron our first progress report rather than trying to answer the
questions in your questionnaire. Accordingly, I an sending you, under
separate cover, a copy or our progrees report.

Very truly yours

Philip ll. Horse
