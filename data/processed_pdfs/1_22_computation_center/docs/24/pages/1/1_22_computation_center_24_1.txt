This time we give you a bivariate approximation to
the integral

holding to better than .0013% for méleéoo and 24m Lo,
(The upper limit of integration is t<=%%; awkward
notation!) 1In this error statement, m is considered
to be a continuous parameter. Any similarity be-
tween the wording of this newsletter and that of
Note-21 is due to sheer laziness.
