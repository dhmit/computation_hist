Room 26-142
M.I.T.

Dear Professor Morse:

Many thanks for your contribution to the program for the New
England newspapermen last Thursday.

I think some of them found the first session on mathematics
quite puzzling. But you and your associates showed them the pertinence
of the previous material to problems which they could grasp. The
choice of examples of the computer's work was excellent.

My only regret is that time was so limited. You would have been
deluged with questions if we had given them more time at the Computation
Center.

Some of the Harvard people the next day yielded to the temptation
to lecture these fellows about the sins of the newspapers, and it diverted
them from the subject matter. I think they got more out of their day
at M.I.T. because everyone on our faculty stuck to his subject and
did his best to increase their understanding of it.

With best wishes,
As ever,
o, (or
