Dear Mr . Roggeve en:

We are very pleased to announce a new program which will make the
Royal Precision LGP—BO computer available to many schools which
previously could not purchase a computer. The Royal McBee Corpora~
tion will make a contribution of 25% of the purchase price to any
accredited educational institution which buys an LGP—BO digital com-
puter. This reduces the price from $39,600 to $29,700. We make no
educational demands; you are free to use the computer as you wish.

We only request that you make any programs which you develop available
to us.

You may be interested to know that we are presently programming the
LGP-3O for a very elaborate earthwork problem. The State of Indiana
has purchased a computer for their highway engineering problems and
will receive delivery this month.

If this new program interests you and you would like more information
please contact us.

Yours very truly,

ROYAL McBEE CORPORATION
