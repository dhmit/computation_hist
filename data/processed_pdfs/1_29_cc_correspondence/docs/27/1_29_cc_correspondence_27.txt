Subject: Recent JBM Revisions and Extensions of the Portran-FAP Bomftor System
: a

The Computation Center plans to imtroduce the recent IBM revisions
and extensions to the Fortran-FAP Momitor System om April 3, 1961, The
revisions provide a faster operating system; both Fortran compilation and
BSS loading time have been significantly decreased. The extensions imelude
the additional control ecard options such as LABEL and LISTS described im the
slightly revised Reference Manual T08/7090 Fortran Programming System (C28-
6054-2). These changes are extensive and must be made compatible with our es

existing system,

Because these revisions require changes in present prograwning
practices, the Center is delaying the imclusion of thew in the System wntil
the above date. These changes are:

1, All gymbolie subprogram decks within a Job or chain link must
precede all the binary subprograms decks for that Job or chaim limi. No
H llerith cards way appear in a deck between the first binary card amd the
CHAIN or DATA card. |

2, The faster BES loading program does not allow execution to
take place if the program loaded (exclusive of COMMON) overlaps the losder
and its tables, Thus a few Jobs characterized by a large umount of Program
and little COMMON which run under the present system, say mot rum im the

3, The Chain tapes have been changed internally to Ad, BZ, and
B3. Thua A4 (logical 8) is the recommended chain tape amd may not be used
as a scratch tape for chaim Jobs; Bl can be used instead. Source language
Compatibility is maintained though 1.@,, the statenent

CALL CHAIN (REC BI)
will compile im such a way that physical tape Ad is used instead of Bl.
4. The DATE control card will be ignored and treated ss a COMmEnt

if vaed, Im the MIT system, the date on which a job is rum will atomatically
appear on the page tending
