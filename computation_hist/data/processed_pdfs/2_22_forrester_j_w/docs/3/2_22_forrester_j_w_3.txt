Professor Philip M. Morse
Director of the Computation Center
6-101

Dear Professor Morse:

I have just had a letter from Professor Ferris W. Norris,
Chairman of the Electrical Engineering Department at the University
of Nebraska. They are planning to start a computing center at
the University soon which will be equipped with a 650 or a Univac I
or some medium priced computer.

He writes, "We are also interested in finding someone
with an adequate mathematical background and experience with com-
puters, who might be appointed as Director of the Center, and
who would also undertake to organize suitable courses in "Numerical
Analysis! and in 'Computers and Their Applications'. Perhaps you
know one or more persons who might be interested in being considered
for this position. Any information or recommendations you might
make in this connection would be greatly appreciated by the committee.‚Äù

If you have any suggestions of men who might be interested
in this position, I would appreciate it if you would write directly
to Professor Norris or send me the information which I can relay to
him.

Sincerely,

F ster
