The military history timeline uses an open source tool called TimelineJS.
I chose to use this tool because it already has a nice presentation and allows for easy edits on 
a spreadsheet. However, if we want to make changes that are not on the spreadsheet, it also 
allows for that. More infomation can be found at:

This is the link to the google spreadsheet that connects to the timeline:
