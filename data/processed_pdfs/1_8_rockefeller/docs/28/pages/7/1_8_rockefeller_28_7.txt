ito gee what are the consequences of uirioue atrategies. If‘the

"games" are to oorrespond. ven distantly, to some actual social
situation, the rules mn:t,beignitecanplicated and the scoring
will require s great deal of statistical computation. It has
been found that only by the use bf comput ing méchinos cﬁn the
scoring beAspeeded up surficiéntly so that enough games can be
run thrcugh-to provide an overall grasp of the situation under
study. Such "gaming techniques" are closely related to the
experiments of Bavelas on the behavior of task-oriented groups.
The use of a properly programmed computer would provide such
experiments with a powerful and flexlble means of changing,
‘”contrelling; and analyzing these.gxpgrimenta in social psychology.
In this field we could work in close collaboration with the
"Center for International Studies st KIT and with the psychology
departments in several other colleges.

Suggested Guidance for the Research
The research activities of the Computation Center are

guided and coordinated by an Advisory Commlttee consisting of
representatives from each of the participating colleges each
chosen by the president of their college. This Committee provides
overall policy guidance in all activities. But to gulde the work
in social science outlined above, we will need ancother, more
specialized group. If financial support for this activity is
forthecoming, about six top-flight social sclentists from the
participating institutions will be invited to join a special advisory
