This last ingredient is the part which is left out of the
contribution which IBM has made to the Computation Center. To put
the Center at the forefront of research, we must have a full-time

staff of enthusiastic machine Specialists, to teachnatuéents how
to make the machine do its tricks and to join with research workers,
who come with a "gleam in their eye", forming teams which can utilize
to the fullest the computer'’s capabllities in research. This staff
will be hard, but not impossible, to recruit. We have the beginnings
of one formed now, at present slanted chiefly toward research in the
physical sciences, and we have obtained an NSF grant of Z35,000 a
year for 3 years to support it. We have the graduate student bodies
of the participating institutions to pick from and we have already
begun to make contact with those students who are Interested in
machine utilization?"fhere are about two dozen IBM Research Assis-
tants appointed for this year; We should be able to pick from the
best of these a few who would like to stay on for two or three years
more, after they have obtained their advanced degrees in engineering,
mathematlecs or science, to be a part of our research staff, potential
members of research teams.

Budget for the Social Sciences.

To make up a staff which could handle the social Science
problems as well as the physical science ones would need another
4 or 5 good men, research men plus the technicians to back them up,
plus a small budget for travel and incidental supplies and equipment,
approximately £35,000 a year for three years. It would take about
5 years to get rolling and the developments should be reviewed at

the end of » years, to see where to go next. Such a staff should be
