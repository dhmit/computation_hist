Dear Phil,

Enclosed please find a copy of a letter from Taub to
Walker in which tfÂ¢suggests a date for our meeting, if we
would like to hold it in Allerton House during May.
Personally I have no objection to the date and wonder how
you feel about it.

If you would like me to come and talk to you please let
Miss Hill telephone Union 1-2900, Ext. 380 what time would
be convenient, Tuesday afternoon usually is the best day
but I can arrange others.

With best regards.

Sincerely yours,

Ls

Walter F. Freiberger
Associate Professor of
Applied Mathematics
