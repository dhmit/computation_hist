Professor P. M. Morse
Room 26-142

Dear Professor Morse:

Shortly we must publish an announcement of the Fall Series
of Industrial Liaison Symposia. Each symposium is described in
a paragraph about the material to be presented and about the
level of comprehension expected of those who attend. These
paragraphs average ten lines in length. I have enclosed the
last announcement for illustration.

If it is convenient I would like to meet with you during
the week of August 1llth to prepare this paragraph for the Com-
putation symposium which we discussed in our last meeting. We
would like to have these paragraphs completed by August 15th
and hope that this will be possible.
