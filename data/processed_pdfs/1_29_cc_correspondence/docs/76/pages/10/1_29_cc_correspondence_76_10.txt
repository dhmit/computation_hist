This consists of the following:

a. The output tape, A3, contains the information which
comprises the first two files of a compilation in the
single compile mode; that is, the source program and the
map of object program storage.

b. The object program in relocatable binary is stacked on
tape B4 for peripheral punching without the required

library subroutines.

The different Monitor control cards and their effects are:

a. CARDS ROW. (Not recommended.) This card instructs the
.Monitor to punch on-line standard FORTRAN relocatable
row binary cards, preceded by a BSS loader if a main

program.

b. CARDS COLUMN. (Not recommended for normal use.) This
card instructs the Monitor to punch on-line columnar
binary relocatable cards (no loader), and do not stack

binary output on tape B4 for peripheral punching.

Note that CARDS ROW and CARDS COLUMN cannot be used with

the same source programs.

Â¢c. LIST. This card instructs the Monitor to list on the
output tape following the core storage map, the object
program in FAP-type language.

d. LIBE. (Not recommended for normal use.) This card in-
structs the Monitor to search the FORTRAN library for
subroutines during compilation of each subprogram and
include these with the object subprogram. This control
card is normally not recommended inasmuch as, when
compiling several subprograms, multiple copies of library
subroutines may be punched. Moreover, during a compile-
and-execute job the loader of the object program auto-

matically searches the library for missing subprograms.
