The Chi-Sguare Integral (Part EEL)

Before displaying further apprroximations, let us
bpresent the 'analysis' that went into our choice of
parametric form for the Cross—section fits of Note-20,
We sought a parametric form that would be as useful
in the fitting of cross—-sections for low values of

m as for large values of m,

When m is Large

Referring to Fisher, we learn that the Chi-Square
Integral is approximated by

ngé-v2m—l

(1) G =t

Ve

for large m. This suggests that we use a variable
such as

2) A =~[2m=1 - 232

in a form such as

 

(3) F2(X) = A . w
l+alA+a2A2+a5Aé] ‘

 

for approximation over Osu?{m. Our reason for this
choice is that (1) behaves much like a decaying
exponential function of (2) and the right member of
(3) handles such a function very well. But how could
& form like this be used for small m?

When m is Small

The Chi-Square Integral is essentially the Incomplete
Gamma function. Here's a little sample approximation
