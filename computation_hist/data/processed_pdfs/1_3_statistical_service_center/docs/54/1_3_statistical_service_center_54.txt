The purpose of this mamorandus Ly. to sresent a rate
structure for the Card Programmed Calculator which evolved
88 & consequence of our meeting on October 22, 19253, It
is proposed that this rate structure be effective for the
period July 1, 1953 until fur ther nesien,

Although a number of dpersting clans were di scuseed,
the following recommendations were made at this Nea, |

1.) The monthly machine rental charges for the CPC
(Including two 941 units, and two auxiliary
machines) is $2400, This figure is the primary
shift charge and it includes a 20% educational
discount granted by the 18M Corporation.

2.) The monthly coet of $2400 is to be recovered by
assessing a charge ef $15 per hour for each hour
"of scheduled machine use. (it is believed that
a charge for scheduled hours will minimize the
"lost ¥ CPC wachine time and, hence, increase
overall operating efficiency).

3.) The method of cost z2llecation is Intended to
assess CFC malntenance costs to the particular
user scheduled te use the machine &i the lize
it "breaks down", Operaticnal experience during
Lhe past 10 months reveals thet as much as R8
hours per month msy be required for TEST, SERVICE,
and PREVENTATIVE Maintenance of the CFC,

8) Net average DAYSFIFT hours = 160-28 = 132 hes o/month
b) Minimum No, of usage hours required to recover
cost = 160 hrs./month, i.e. 160 hr, x $15 = §2400,

6.) EDUCATICNAL Research

a) 8,25 Mechire-alid Analysis « Senior subject
Ta Electronic Digetal Computation « Graduate Sud fest
ec) 18,

e) Thesis Research
are specdfic subjects which demeénd CPC machine time. Unfore
tunately, clients in these categories do HOT have Necessary
funds ts pay the §15 per hour machine charge.

1t was recormended that the above subjects and clients
be allowed use of the CPC free of charge subject to the
following restrictions

8) Approval for machine use is to be determined by
recommendations received from the Machire Computation
Committee and Fe 1 Verzuh,

b) Educational Research of this type employing the CPC
should preferably be performed at night whenever possible,

7.) Scheduling of CPC Machine Time

A schedule of CPC machine usage will be prepared each
Friday for the forthcoming week. The principal users of tre
CPC (sectivn 4) will be given preferential treatment as far
as TAYSHIFT hours are concerned, However, the z2ssignment of

8,) Operating Personnel

 

Turing the past fiscal fry Ms C, Connors and F, B,
Van Wyk were carried on the period, ef the Air Force Contract
{DIC B-7019) and acted as coerdinators for CPC Self-Service

operation, During the present fisesl period, provision wilt

be made for paying the salaries of two persons from the
Cperations Resssrch Contract and these individuble vill ye
trained te act as coordinators, vw

However, She proposed mode of night shift o;eration

 ¢emands thet a competent individual with 1B background be

hired to act as coordinator during the night shift. As yet,
this man is pot available,

9.) Self-Service Operational Methods

During the past 10 menths, the staff of the Office of
Statistical Services have compiled a group of Five (8)
different general purpose control pénels to permit more effec
tive use of the CFC on & self-service basis, Correspondingly,
five different cperational manualst S«10, S«11, S=«12Z, E13,
and S~14 have been writlen and crinted for general elreulation,
The avallability of these control panels and ssseciated
Manuals is largely respensible for the current mode of effec
tive SELF-SERVICE CPC operation,

Furthermore, & second set of Board Wo. I has been
prepared to peranit use cof other CPC machines in the Boston
area, if the need should arise,

10} Furchase orders aud Billing Procedures

8) Regular clients must submit purchase orders covering
intended CPC usage in an amount determined by the
new rate of £185 per mechine hour,

b) Non-Regulér clients will submit purchase orders
