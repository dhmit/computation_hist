Subject: Proposal for Research and Training Project in Applied

Mathematics, Using Large-Scale Computing Equipment,
‘Particularly Whirlwind

Vhirlwvind Project has now reached a stage of development

 

where its potentialities can be utilizad, together with the other
computing equipment at weernoloaT, in a coordinated research and
training program, of the sort anticipated by ONR during its several
years of support of the Project. Both the Institute and the Navy ere
vitally interested in the use of large-scale computing devices for the
solution of scientific and Sinai prcblems, and for the promoticn
of training for students interested in this field, |
Of course a part of the time of Whirlwind will be used for
the solution of a special Air Force problem, and i% is expected that
the Air Force will contribute an appreciable part of the support of
the Whirlwind Project, for the development of equipment snd methods
for the solution of this problem. Nevertheless, approximately balf
the working time of the machine itself will be avallable for the funda-

mental program, mentioned above and outlined below.


L=25 | Pagas 2

Since a research and training program mist be clogely linked with
other faculty activities, it is proposed that supervision of thig pari: of
the progrem be undertaken by the recently created Center for Machine Compu
tation. The interdepartmental Advisory Commitiee to this Center provides
a broad representation of the various scientific, engineering and training
activities likely to be involved. | |

The program which ONR might wish to support can be divided ino
four sections::

1. Research in methods of numerical analysis and the forrmu-
lation of scientific problems for machine solution, together with support
of training of students in these methods.

2. Support of the scientific and engineering applications
group previously referred to with Project Whirlwind so as to make the
WW computer useful and available for the above research, and an aid to
the research being carried on by MIT faculty and students.

3. A partial support of the maintenance of the WW computer.

4+ Ressarch on and investigation of digital computing machine
components.

It is understood thal details of the program, which is neces
sarily evolutionary in character, will be worked cut from time to time with
the Scientific Officer of the ONR.

It is contemplated that $300,000 per annum for a period of at
least two years will be required to get this program under way. Detall
of the budget is as follows:

Item 1 £100,000
Item 2 100,000
Item 3 50,000
Item 4 50,000

The detalled budget for each of the items may run approximately

as followss
