Institute orfenﬂ}twelve courses primarily concerned with machine

'computation. Two of them are given by the Mathematics Department:
 M39— Methods of Applied Mathematics and M4ll —Numerical Analysis™;
' elght are given by the Electrical Engineering Department: 6.25 —

Machine-Aided Analysis (an introductory survey course for under-

graduates), 6.5%5 —Dig. Comp. Coding and Logiec, Int., 6.536 —

. Machine Computation, 6.537—Digital Comp. App. Prac., 6.538 —

Electronic Comp. Lab., 6.54—Pulsed-Data Systems, 6.567 —Switching
Cireuits, and 6.568—Switching Circuits; and one, 2.215—Numerical
Analysis, 1s given by the Mechanlical Engineering Department. The
teaching of all these courses is directly dependent on the availla-
bility of equipment for demonstration and for student practice.

At present, the total enrollment in these courses is about 400.
Each of these courses could be improved if more equipment were
available-

In addition, the following courses toucﬁ?on computing machine
applications or on machine design and use some equipment for demon-
stration or for student use, which use could be profitably ex-
panded if more equipment were available:
