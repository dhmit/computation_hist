Dr. F. M. Verzuh - June 27, 1958

everflow from your shift, I am sure that you will want to go to three
shift operation.

Dr. R. N. Johanson has full authorization to authorize any -
thing that is in agreement with the contract between IBM and MIT, so
that any further discussion of this oy other matters can be handled by
him. Requests or situations that are not covered in the contract will
be handled by Dr. Johanson or, if he feels it necessary, will be
referred to Dr. M. A. Shader.

Iam sorry that I missed you on my visit to MIT today
but look forward to seeing you some time in the near future.

Sincerely yours,

J. F. Blackburn
University and Research
Institute Representative
