ceeding pections of this report contain the following ix_:fomticn:

i, A list of half-vord logic instructiouns.
2. A brieZ description of the effect of halt-word logic on 704
commands,

The above list of half-word logic imstructions was prepeared by Hr.
Thomas Apple of Applied Science Cambridge. From time to time there may be
additional modifications tc this list. If and when whis information is
available, it will be as supplements to this memo - CC-29,

It should bo noted that there are only a limited number of 704
computers which possess this half-word logie. You are cautioned not to
write programs which you expect to put on other machimes not having this
feature, (At the moment there are only two or three machines which have

half-word logic--MIT, Foughkeepsie, ete). You should therefore govern your -

progragming accordingly.
