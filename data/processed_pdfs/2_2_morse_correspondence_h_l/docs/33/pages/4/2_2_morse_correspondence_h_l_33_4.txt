condenser at least equals that of the shunted resistance,
ie. Cw.=G, where w.=2mc/\c, where ¢ 15 the velocity
of radiation in vacuo, C the capacitance of the condenser
and G the conductance of the shunted resistance.
Therefore A\.=2mcC/G. The conductance anc.l capacl-
tance can be expressed in terms of the conductivity of a
metal strand, o, ; the permittivity of a gap, &; the cross-
sectional area of a strand, which is also the plate area
of the condenser, 4 ; the length of a strand, /; and the
total length, d, of all the gaps in the strand:

G=0c,A/l and C= (ed)/ (4rd).
Therefore,

= 1dcle/ (od).

When the permittivity of the gaps equals that of
vacuum, ce= (376.7)"* mho. For bulk gold the conduc-
tivity is of the order of 105 mho/cm; this value 1s an
upper limit for the conductivity of a strand. Denoting
the ratio of the conductivity of a gold strand to that of
bulk gold by “k,” one obtains ,~10% mho/cm,
0<h<1. Therefore A\:~1.33X10™" l/dh microns. The
assumption that the condensers do not co.ntfibu.te ap-
preciably to the conductivity of the black 1s justified if

N, <100, ie.,if dh/I>1.33X107".

As conservative estimates, let /# be not more than 1072,
and let the total length of gapsina strand add up to not
more than 1 percent of the length of the strand. These
values would lead to a lower limit of dh/l, namely
dh/l~10~4, which still exceeds 1.33X107¢ by a large
factor. Therefore it may be concluded that A,< 100y, so
that the condenser effect need not be considered in the
wavelength region A>100p.

The relaxation effect is therefore very suitably studied
by means of radiation of wavelength greater than 100p.
Drude? and Zener® have considered forces acting on the
electrons that are proportional and opposite in direction
to their velocity, hence frictional in nature. They
derived the following expression for the conductivity:

where o= conductivity, 7= concentration of electrons,
¢=electronic charge, 7=time necessary for average
velocity to drop to a fraction 1/e times its original value
(relaxation time), ¢= velocity of radiation in vacuo, and
\=wavelength of radiation. Letting A go to infinity in
Eq. (10) produces

odc=klima= 2we*nor. (11)
Dividing Eq. (11) by Eq. (10) gives
(ucoaca/ucoa)=1+7*(2wc/N)> (12)

From Eq. (11) it is seen that dc measurements only
give information about the product of the electron
concentration and the relaxation time. Eq. (12) shows

that measurement of the conductivit}f at varioue wave-
lengths can produce data from yvhlch to derive the
relaxation time independently. It 1s noped that a series
of Hall effect measurements Now being performed will
yield independent information about the electron

concentration.
RESULTS, PART II
The dc Conductivity

Equation (12) can be used to determine the relaxation
time if the reduced conductivity per square, wcoqca, is
known. This value was found by.plotting, in Fig. 1,
(ucoa)~ vs (2m/N)% using as expe.nment.al values those
reported 1n Table II. Extrapoletlng ‘thlS curve, which
theoretically should be a straight line, gives as the
ordinate intercept (ucoaca)™, for the ordinate axis
represents A= . Harris and Beasley' have reported
values of dc conductivity obtained by direct electrical
measurements, which are applicable to the samples
described here. Table IIT lists the values of ucoq.a deter-
mined both by extrapolation of the data of Table IT and
by direct measurements performed on these samples
prior to the long-wavelength measurements. The extra-
polated values do not agree very closely with those
obtained by direct measurement. The discrepancy is
believed to be the result of slight sintering of the samples
as a result of the measurements with long wavelengths.
While the samples did not appear to the eye to be sin-
tered, and while the transmission at 7u was found to be
practically unchanged after the longer wavelength
measurements had been made, slight sintering does not
affect the optical properties equally at all wavelengths.
The physical reason is that sintering removes some of
those gaps that prevent current flow through inter-
rupted strands at wavelengths greater than 100x. Thus
the dc conductivity and the conductivity for very long
wavelengths increase on sintering. At 7u the admittance
of the gaps is so much larger that they do not inhibit
current flow; on this basis the higher conductivity at
7u as compared with that at 100u was explained above.
The removal of gaps therefore does not increase the
conductivity at 7u nearly as much as that at 100g. It has
been observed that a sample that sintered sufficiently so
that a brownish cast was observed, had at least a three-
fold increase in dc conductivity. Since the discrepancy
between the values obtained by the two measurements
reported in Table III is much less than threefold, the
amount of sintering that would account for the dc
discrepancy is not nearly enough to alter the appearance
of the sample in visible radiation. For the same reason
the measured values at 7u are not nearly as sensitive to
sintering as those made in the wavelenegth region beyond
100x and with direct current.

listed in Table IV, and agree remarkably well with each
other and with the value 7~107" sec reported® for bulk
metal. The agreement between the values calculated
assuming different values of the density ratio is reassur-
ing. Thus a relaxation time of electrons in gold blacks
of the same order of magnitude as that of electrons in
bulk gold can account for the wavelength dependence
of the conductivity observed for four gold black samples.
The choice of wavelengths A= 345y and A=455u was
made before the theoretical analysis was performed.
In Fig. 1 these two values are seen to be so close together
for the study of relaxation times as hardly to represent
independent measurements. It is hoped that the results
presented here may stimulate further measurements in
the region 105u<\ <345y in order to check the linear
dependence of the reciprocal reduced conductivity per
square on the square of the reciprocal wavelength.

CONCLUSIONS AND SUMMARY

The range of wavelengths larger than 105u appears
very useful for the investigation of the behavior of

«electrons in metal blacks and their absorptive power.

While dc conductivity measurements only give the
product of electron concentration and relaxation time,
the determination of the conductivity by optical means
at various wavelengths provides an independent means
of determining the relaxation time.

The relaxation time of electrons in blacks was found
to be of the same order of magnitude as that in bulk gold.
This would indicate that the amplitude of oscillation of
the electrons is so small that the fine state of division of
gold in a black does not hinder the response of the elec-
trons to radiation of wavelength greater than 100u.

A closed expression was derived for finding the con-
ductivity of thin films at large wavelengths in terms of
the observed transmission and absorption of any film,
whether a black deposit or a bright film. It has been
shown that the reduced conductivity per square of film
is a very fundamental property of metal films and a very
useful one because (A) it determines directly the optical
behavior of the film and at long wavelengths approaches
the absorption per unit transmission asymptotically,
(B) it is dimensionless, and (C) it can be determined
vﬁvlithout a very accurate knowledge of the density of the

m.

The optical constants are not nearly as useful because
they are strongly dependent on the density of the black.
While it was originally thought that they had to be
determined first from optical measurements in order to
find the conductivity, it now turns out that by means of
Eq. (9) the conductivity is found much more easily than
are the optical constants.

The following conclusions can be drawn from the pres-
ent investigation about the structure of metal blacks.

a x is the ratio of the density of bulk gold to that of the gold black deposit.,

As the blacks have an extremely low density and yet
conduct direct current, they probably consist of yarn-
like strands relatively far apart. The dc conductance
of metal blacks is about 10~ times that of bright
deposits of comparable weight per unit area. This
low ratio is due both to the longer conducting path in
blacks and to the lower concentration of electrons in the
blacks. This comparatively low concentration has two
causes, namely the low concentration of metal in blacks,
and the low concentration of electrons in the metal
strands.
