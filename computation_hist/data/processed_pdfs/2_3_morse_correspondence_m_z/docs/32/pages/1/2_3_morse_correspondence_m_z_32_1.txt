I trust 5ou finally got home from Washington. My plane Just made it
to Laguardia as the weather closed in.

The Clebsh-Gordan picture looks rather grim. Say 1 and l' are to be
combined to give L. Then for given magnetic quantum numbers m and m'
as well as for a given 1 and 1' there are a total of

(1+l') —[rm~m'l+4.

possible L's. This expression must be summed on m: lmls l, and m':
[m'lg l', and then summed on 1 and 1' from zero to some maximum value
which we wish to include in the table.

The leading term in the resultant sum goes as l5 (sob). A fractional
coefficient in front of this term can be gained § taking account of

the various symmetries of the C.-G.'s but this is immediately obliterated
as soon as you include half—integer angular momenta.

Did I hear somebody say lmax 30.
Nick sends his warmest regards.

P.S. There exists a ”Numerical Table of the C.—G. Coefficients" by
Albert Simon, Oak Ridge: ORNL-lYlS, up to l=l‘=\’)/2. This seems
good enough for most problems feasible without a high speed
computer.
