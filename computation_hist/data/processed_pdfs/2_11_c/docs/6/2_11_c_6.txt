Dear Dr. Leone :

_ I an returning your questionnaire on free machine time, as
it does not seem to be applicable in our case. The 1311 .704 installed
here at the Institute is primarily tor. the Universities e1 New England
and is not available for work originating elsewhere or for industrial
‘or military work.

I think probably the background of the organization here
and the arrangements under which it works can lost easily be obtained
Iron our first progress report rather then trying to answer the
questions in your questionnaire. Accordingly, I an sending you. under
separate cover, a copy or our progress report.

Very truly yours

Philip I. Horse
