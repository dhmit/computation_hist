and probably should not; satisfy ali the demands, A much more
realistic task would be to concentrate on 1) the educational tasks,
which will be Supplemental to the on-campus small machines for the
other New England colleges and which, for the MIT eclass needs, can

Even with this sort of limitation on the use 'of the Center
faclilities, the demands on the Center will grow. But the growth,

if thus limited, can, we believe, be handled by the ‘cooperative
effort of IBM ang MIT. A 7090 within the year would, not delay most
of the work outlined above,tqq;seriously, And, as outlined below,

made for the next step. On the other hand, if a 7090 cannot be
