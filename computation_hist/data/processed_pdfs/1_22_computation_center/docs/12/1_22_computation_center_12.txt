Mr, P, V. Cusick

Dear Paul:

In accordance with your recent discussions concerning the
overe ditures incurred in connection with furniture procurement
for the new MIT Computation Center, I am now advising you of the
present status of the furniture procurement to date. Specifically,
furniture has been procured primarily from three (3) firms:

E & I Cooperative Service, Gemeral Fireproofing Company, and
Contract Interiors, respectively. The following tabulation indicates
expenditures to date for the three catepories:

E & I Coopemative Service $ 5,626.72

General Pireproofing Co. 5,376.46
Contract Interiors 775.93
Others

1,272.82
$13,051.53

It is apparent from the above that we have spent monies
in excess of the amount appropriated on our Budget Authorization which
was for $12,500,

As I discussed with you and Professor Floe, the purpose of
this letter is to indicate the present status of these expenses ang to
enclose the attached list of expected additional expendi tures amounting
to approximately $10,000, 1 would appreciate discussing this matter with
you concerning receipt of the necessary authorization to go ahead in
obtaining additional equipment which is sO desperately needed in the
Computation Center,

Sincerely yours,

F. M.. Verzuh
