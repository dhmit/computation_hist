: Sub ject: Courses Related to Computing Instruments at M.I.T., Past,
Present, and Future
| Early Development - The amount of training, both formal and in-
. formal, in the design and use of computing equipment has always
 peen closely related to the availability of such equipment, at
the Institute. It was available here quite early because of the
interest of Vannevar Bush and his students. The Electrical Engl-
neering Department had moet of this equipment before 19405 a
 pifferential Analyzer, a Network Analyzer and others, fhe few
courses concerned with machine computer design and use were E. E,
| courses and were attended chiefly by E. E. majors. AS the equip-
| ment increased in effectiveness, however, staff and students of
| other Departments became interested until, by 1940, at least half
of the 24 attendees of 6.60 Math--Anal. by Mechanical Methods

 

were from other Departments.

Since 1945, the Institute has added a great number of computing
devices to its facilities: Whirlwind, some I.B.M. equipment,
several large electronic analogue devices, and So on. Some of
these are in the Mechanlcal and Aeronautical Engineering Depart-
ments, so that more students have close contact with their con-
struction and use. Because of the growing importance of such
equipment in engineering and scientific training, the Institute
set up an interdepartmental Committee on Numerical Analysis and

Machine Computation to coordinate the educational use of tis

equipment, to suggest the introduction of new courses inthe field
and to help supervise student research in this area.

Present Courses Related to Machine Computation - 8s year the

 

Institute of feré twelve courses primarily concerned with machine

computation. Two of them are given by the Mathematics Department:
- M39— Methods of Applied Mathematics and M41ll —Numerieal Analysis’;
eight are given by the Electrical Engineering Department: 6.25 —

Machine-Aided Analysis (an introductory survey course for under-

graduates), 6.5%5 —Dig. Comp. Coding and Logie, Int., 6.536 —

. Machine Computation, 6.537 —Digital Comp. App. Prac., 6.538 —

Electronic Comp. Lab., 6.54—Pulsed-Data Systems, 6.567 —Switching
Circuits, and 6.568—Switching Circuits; and one, 2.215—Numerical
Analysis, 1s given by the Mechanical Engineering Department. The
teaching of all these courses is directly dependent on the avalla-
bility of equipment for demonstration and for student practice.

At present, the total enrollment in these courses is about 400.
Each of these courses could be improved if more equipment were
available.

In addition, the following courses touch, on computing machine
applications or on machine design and use some equipment for demon-
stration or for student use, which use could be profitably ex-
panded if more equipment were available:

Less Formal Training Opportunities - At least as important as the
formal courses mentioned above are the other chances for students
and staff to learn about computing equipment. The Whirlwind staff
gives several short courses each term in machine coding methods
for anyone who wishes to learn. Attendance has been between 20
and 40 per course. The Committee on Numerical Analysis and Machine
Computation has had about 16 Research Assistantships available for
graduate students of high standing in any Department, who wish to

learn computing machine techniques and who intend to use these


He

techniques in the course of their thesis research. These assistant-

 

ships have been very fruitful in the spread of the understanding
of machine capabilities throughoyt the Institute, for not only
does the graduate student and his immediate assoclates learn
about computing machines and thelr use but, even more important,
his faculty advisors in the varlous departments have a chance to LAY
learn of the usefulness of the new machines in their special #
fields. These advisors have sent more students to learn about
machine computation and have initiated more research using machine
results. For example, most of the professors of theoretical physics
are supervising thesis research in nuclear theory or solid state
theory, the computation of which will be done by Whirlwind or by
the I.B.M. equipment we have. Our research in nuclear reactor
design will have to be done with machine help.
Many of our best and most imaginative machine programmers
have been introduced to computing equipment via these Assistant-
ships. They started out being interested in machines as a tool
to help them in thelr research in physies or chemical engineering
or whatever; they ended by being interested in the operation of
the equipment itself. Such assistantships or fellowships are a
vital part of our training program; their number should be in-
creased as soon as more machine facilities become available.
Future Expansion - With a few exceptions, it will not be necessary
to increase appreciably the number of courses concerned with
machine computation, if more machine facilities become available;
what will be important will be the increase in contact hours per

student with the equipment. Some of the courses listed above now


have to limit their actual contaet: with machines to one or two
hours of demonstration per term, whereas they could and should ex-
pand this time enough so each student has a chance to participate
in the operation, so he can actually get a "feel" for the process.
Such an expansion of contact hours is impossible at present; with
careful scheduling 1t could be accomplished with an appropriately
located TO4, with adequate space and auxiliary equipment. Even
with the courses listed above, 1t could easily grow to 3000-4000
student contast-hours per term.

As soon as more equipment 1s available, more courses in
business data handling can be initiated and the course in operations
research can be expanded. Probably other courses, inc sub jectonnot
yet envisaged, will also be made possible.

Plans are now being made to expand our research program in
operations research, in systems engineering and in the quantitative
analysis of industrial and governmental operation. Funds will be
sought to increase the number of assistantships and fellowships
which can be granted for research in these fields, SO that we can
compete with other fields for the good students. None of these
plans could be implemented unless we are sure We will have the
best computing equipment, adequately housed and appropriately
staffed.
