Dear Phil

I am glad to have a description of the project relating to
the use of the high—speed digital computer for social science re—
search. The individuels mentioned in your letter are those most
likely to have both a direct interest and a knowledge of other soc—
ial scientists who would share the same concerns.

Ezra Glaser has agreed to write a memo for us concerning
the problems and possibilities that relate to the use of computers
in social science research. He has arranged to devote a month, or
so, to the preparation of such a memo. I am hopeful that his thoughts
may have some bearing on the project that you have in hand. He can
be reached at National Analysts, Inc., 1015 Chestnut Street, Phila—

delphia 7, Pennsylvania .
Sincerejy

p.s. Sam Stouffer's nme has probably already been brought
to your attention as a possible member for your advisory
committee. Robert Bush, now at the New York School of
Social Work, might also be another candidate. He was

trained in physics and later got his Ph. D. in social
relations at Harvard. PH
