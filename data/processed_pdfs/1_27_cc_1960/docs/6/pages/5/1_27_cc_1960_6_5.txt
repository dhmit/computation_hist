the experiment or the scientist can go on to the next step and
request the next computation in tura. On the 704 this would
reguire the exclusive use of the machine, though only a fraction
of the 704 speed would be used;. obviously again, time-sharing
techniques are needed, |

These, and many other programs now in progress, such as
the character-recognition studies ~~. . _ - , the research
on economic forecasting end on operational behavior using large-
scale simulation techmniques, should be of particular interest to
LB, for they have direct bearing on the progress of computer
design and utilizs cion. hey represent the sort of cooperative
research between experts in different fields which .KEIT does so
effectively, and they involve the combination of research and
education for which ilIT 18 pre-eminent. This work deserves
support by IBi, in addition to the educational activities which
are already being supported by the present contribution of the 704,
They can most effectlve1yw%y the installation of a 7090, replacing
the 704, in the near fubture; IMIT will then be able to provide
the «aS=eme ancillary equipment to push ahead with dispatch.
Because of the "inter-connectedness" of much of this research,
it can best be carried out (perhaps it can only be carried out)
in the atmosphere of mutual cooperation amd exchange of infor-
nation provided by the Computation Ca}'ser.@
