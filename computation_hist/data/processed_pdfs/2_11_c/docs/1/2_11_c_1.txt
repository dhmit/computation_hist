Dear Mr. Caddell:

I am replying to your recent letter sent to
Professor Morse concerning a visit to the MIT Computation
Center.

Professor Morse will probably be tied up at the
time of your conference, but I will be glad to see you if
you wish. I have spoken to Dr. Verzuh and he has indicated
that he will not be available on Friday but that it would
be possible to see you on 4:00 p.m. on Thursday, April 21.

Sincerely,

/

F. J. Corbato
