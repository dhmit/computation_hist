might be very attractive if it had the following properties.

2.

Copies to:

Fellows are programmers of some experience
in industry.

Their companies pay the difference between
their normal salaries and what the Center can
pay.

They help with the more attractive problems
the Center is currently working on. The
announcement lists opportunities for work on:

a. Compilers

b. Artificial Intelligence
c. Simulation Studies

d. Numerical Analysis

e. Pattern recognition

Seminars in suitable topics are held.
It is advertised that fellows will

a. gain experience on new types of
problems,

b. meet other expert programmers
from other places,

c. participate 1n the development of
a programming theory.

Probably it will not be necessary to have a degree
program although this may be desirable.

Some announcement should be made at the next
SHARE meeting.
