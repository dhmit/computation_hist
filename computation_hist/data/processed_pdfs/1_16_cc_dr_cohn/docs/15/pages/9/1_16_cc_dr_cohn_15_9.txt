Looking at the :01 row we ﬁnd the elements of like sign cornpai‘e as

in numerical magnitude:

written as (RR. ), (Q.P. ), (QS. ), (SR. ) respectively.

Looking at the .7:2 row we obtain six more entries, ( .P.R.), ( 13.3.);
(Q.P. ), (SP. ), (R.Q ), (RS. )', and looking at the $3 row we obtain six
ﬁnal entries, ( .Q.P.),( .133); (RE. i, (BS. ), (RI). ), (SQ. ).

We now have 18 entries (possibly repetitive), and the rule is simpl,v
that the neighbors are those remaining when the triples oi the above 13 type»
are eliminated. Thus going back (11.1) we see the entry ( .lt.Q) dispoSUS

of the integral modules with lowest discriminant. The case A9: 196 is the
