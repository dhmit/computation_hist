the various control cards, source decks (with or without data)
and object subprograms may be intermixed in the same job-file.
The different types of job-files may be intermixed on the same

input tape.
Y DIAGNOSTICS
FORTRAN compiler diagnostics are indicated by messages on the on-
line printer. The Monitor has its own diagnostics, independent

of the FORTRAN diagnostic system. On-line operator options for

machine error stops, however, are given in the same way.

I11. STOPS

 

50g 1-CS stop. Bad library tape or check sum. Depress
the Start Key to try again.

Start Key.
