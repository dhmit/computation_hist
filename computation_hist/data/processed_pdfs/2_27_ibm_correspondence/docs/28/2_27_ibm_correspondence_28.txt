Room 6-107

In accordance with our letter to you dated April 27,
1960, an IBM 7090 system has been placed on order for the
M.I.T. Computation Center for delivery in early 1962. For
your information the actual specifications of the 7090 system
and the two 1401 systems for peripheral operations are listed
on the attached sheets.

The basic 7090 is essentially the same system as
the present 709. Not included at the present moment are the
Direct Data Device on the fourth channel of the 7090 or provision
for CRT output. These and other special devices will have to
be decided upon during the next six to eight months.

Sincerely yours,

M. Loren Bullock
