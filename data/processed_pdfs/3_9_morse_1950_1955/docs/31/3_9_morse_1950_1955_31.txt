Dear Professor Martin:

In accordance with the request received from
Professor Morse, the following calculating machines have

been transferred to Room 2«2683 for student use in connec
tion with Subject M411,

Serial Purchase Purchase
CA No. No. Type of Mach. Date Price
Monroe CA=J 295439 10=place l=9«4] $585,
Nat .Cash CA-5 542688 3000 machine T=1«40 §1815,25
Marchant CA-9 171131 8-place 12=dad? 5546,
Marchant CA~-13 125558 E=place S5=10=45 £548,
Marchant CA-14 195270 f=place S5«10«45 £546,
Marchant CA«1l5 195269 B=place 5«10«45 $546,
Marchant CA«16 195292 Beplace 5«10«45 $546,
$5414.25

These machines were purchased by the Center of Analysis for
use in the desk~calculator section. More recently, these
machines have been used jointly by the staff of the Numerical
Aralysls Laboratory and by students in the former numerical
analysis subjects 6,531 - 6,534,

It is evident from the above purchase dates that
the machines are not new and have seen considerable use. I
have therefore recommended that the existing service con-
tracts on the Marchant calculators be maintained in order
that reliable service will be available during the forth=-
coming period of heavy student use. Accordingly, 1 have
submitted 5 invoices ($30 per year per machine) to
Miss Goodwin for payment.

Neither the Monroe or the National Cash Register
machines have been on a service contract, and repairs are
therefore obtained by calling the respective agency.
