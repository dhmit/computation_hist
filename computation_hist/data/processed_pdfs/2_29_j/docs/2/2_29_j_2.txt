Dear Mr. 'sortner:

Professor horse has forwarded to no your letter
requestins~intornation on the solution 01’ fourth order
bihamonio-type boundary value problems. I do not know anyone
who is solving such problems at present. However, it is
quite possible tint one or the 500 problems now using machine
time does involve the solution of such problems.

If you could give me some sore detailed information
as to the source or us work, a further investigation would
be possible.

— I an enclosing a copy or the Computation Center's
semi-annual report which has rather extensive lists or the

work being done at the present time.'1'his may be or help
in determining proper references.

Sincerely vours,

Dean N. Arden
