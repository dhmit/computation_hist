Deay Dr, Shader:

We were very pleased to have a chance to report to Mr, Watson
and the others of your party on our progress. The suggestions you
made will be of value to us and Mr, Watson's indication of his
continued support is encouraging.

As we pointed out then, we find, from time to time, that we
need auxilisry equipment, or small modifications of the 704 itself,
in order to make the machine more useful to its users. Ome example
of this, mentioned briefly at the meeting, is the addition of the
so-called Beal Time Package for the 704 main frame, This addition
would enable several Â£.8E. students to use the 704 for thelr Ph.D.
thesis work in communications, which otherwise would have to be
done on some cutaide machine, or not done at sill. There are
indications that, once installed, it would be continually useful,

In cases like this, I feel it only appropriate that the
Institute contribute toward the additional cost of these modifica
tions, that iBH not be asked to contribute more than you are already
contributing. But I wonder whether it is fair to ask the Institute
to pay the same price for the modification that IBM would charge its
commercial customers. Would it not be possible, for example, for us
to pay IBM the actual cost of the real time package, rather than
cost plus profit?

iI would be glad to talk over this problem with you im the near
future, to see whether we can work out a mutually satisfactory

procedure for getting these needed modifications and additions, and
specifically to see what can be done about getting the real time
package installed here, in time to be of use to the present group of
students,
