Note that for » — 8 the fundamental units are shown as conjugates of a

single unit while 7 =4 does not occur, in accordance with the conclusion
of 92 above. In this way we obtain a group ®* whose multiplication rules

can be given as follows:

where B” = (EZ*)E’ and a;= aZta;Z".

Now, the only possible proportionalities that mix rows are those coming
from the group %, i.e., based on wunits, for the cube of any element of ®*
is an element of ®, hence based on a scalar unit. (See section 21).

Case I: M not equwalent to a normal module. Here r—2.4. or 8 and
2. =3

every ® is one of a set of 7/2 (i.e., /2 different “ points” in the chain ”
diagrams of 12).

Case IT: M equwalent to a mormal module. Here r=2 or 8 and
every @ is one of a set of 3r/2 except when the ¢ is proportional (row by row)
to one in which three of the quantities P, Q, R, S are conjugates. (In the
exceptional case @ 1s one of a set of r/2 again). |

In the table [7, p. 832] we find evidence of some of these cases for
r—8. (ase I corresponds to A* =148, while Case II (or its exception)
corresponds to the proportionality classes that occur by twelves (or by fours).
Note that the module for A? = 196 is neither an ideal nor normal, yet the
correspondence “by fours” means it must be proportional to a normal
module (with even a normal basis). The numerical work is being carried
much further than in Part I, but it will be the subject of a separate report.

25. Concluding remarks. In Part I, Section 2, a modified quadratic
simple continued fraction algorithm was outlined. It turns out to be more
conventional than first thought, in fact it is equivalent to the continued

fraction algorithm with the “ mediant ™ fractions thrown in. The geometrical

. . - . . . "‘ - .
construction given in 2 can be seen to be a variation of Smith’s construction

[10].
In Part III, the concluding portion, we shall treat the algorithm as a

means of discovering “small norms 2 (analogously with the Pell Equation).
