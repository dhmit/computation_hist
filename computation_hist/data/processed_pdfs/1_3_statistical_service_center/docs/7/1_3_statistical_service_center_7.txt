introduction

The purpose of this memorandum is to present a revised
rate structure for the Office of Statistical Services which
is to be effective during the fiscal period 1952-19353,

On October 1, 1 952 a report was issued entitled “Rate
Structure for the Office of Statistical Services during the
Fiscal Period 1952-1553" which presented a proposed rate
structure for that perlod. At two meetings held on
October 17th and 21st attended by Messrs, John A, Little
and F, ¥, Verzuh, this proposed rate structure was discussed
and evaluated, The method of cost allocation for the labor
charge and the materiel charges was considered acceptable;
however, the proposed machine charges were not approved,

The machine charge is designed to compensate for cere
tain operational or overhead expenses incurred in this office,
1t was decided that a considerestion of the following items
would facilitate the formulation of an equitable machine
charge!

1. A definition of the actual Items which comprise

the overhead charges.

Ze The determination of a fair method for allocating

the overhead charges on 2 machine utilization basis,

3, The distribution of & portion of the overhead

charges to the underwriters of the 604 [lectronic
Calculator and the Card Progremmed Calculator.
Since the letter two machines are not supported by
the administration, they are hereafter referred to
as the "Special" computers,

4, The formulation of an slternative method for unders

writing the rental costs of the Special computers.

Definition of Overhead Charges

Since 8l]l the underwriters ¢f the special machines are
DIC projects, Mr, P, V, Cusick was consulted to determine
whether he concurred with the basic proposal for allocating

a portion of the cverhead charges to the underwriters. With
his approval, the following plan was formulated.

The supervision and administrative costs amounting
te $7864 on an annual basis, (See page 5 of the
Rate Structure Report of October 1, 1952)

The capltal=-euipment costs associated with machine
operation, e.g. machine plugboards, card files,
fans, typewriter, desk calculator, etc, During
the fiscal period 15511952, the capital equipment
costs amounted to $2770.72. Admittedly, some of
these costs are of a nonerecurrent nature, and

an estimate of such charges 1s given in & later
section,

The miscellaneoussoperating expenses consist of
office supplies, express charges, reference texts,
travel expense, nachine ribbons, and other misc.
expenses, During the fiscal perfed 19511852 the

miscellaneous operating expenses amounted te £1145.04,

Distribution of Overhead Costs

The fellowing tabulation is an gstimate of the distribu-
tien of the components of the overhead charge between the
regular and special machines,

Allocation of Overhead Costs on 8 Machine Utilization Basis

It must be emphasized that the distribution of the

overhead costs given in Table I is at best a very rough

stimate, This is particularly true of the supervision and
administration costs, The principal reason for the rough-
ness of the estimate is the lack of operational experience
with the Card Programmed Calculator. However, 1f the above
distribution {s mccepted as & basis for cost allocation, the
following procedure may be used:

1, Distribute the overhead ccats for the syeainl’ Maw
chines among the underwriters on a percentage
basis «= the percentage is te be based on the
monthly rental cost of the machine. Specifically,

Under- | Percent- Monthly

writing Monthly (age of Overhead
Project Fercentnage | Machine | Rental Spec, Mach, | Charge
NSL | 608 | $565.40 | 25,96 $126.92
Meteor Proj. (40%) | EME is | -29e0R 144,81
Aeronautic Engg, | (40%) CPC 648, | 28,62. 144,81
Verguh Research | (20%) CPC 322,50 | 14,80 72.36
52177.90 100% $480 ,80

The column laballed "Monthly Overhead Charge” is obtained by
distributing 4074,.,15/8.333-5488 ,90 per month (the estimated
overhead charges associated with special machines) on 8 pers
centage basis, The percentage is, of course, determined by
the monthly rental cost of the machine,

This overhead cost 1s to be bllled to each of these
projects each menth aleng with the associated menthly rental
cost of the particular machine,

2, The overhead costs appearing in Table I in the
column labelled Regular Machines is to be distributed
in accordance with the established formulae which
employ the machine utilization factor. (see pp.7-9
of the report dated October 1, 1952).

Rate Structure for the 604 snd cPg Calculators

the twe special mRchines require a different type of
rete structure for two reasens:

1. The machine charge must recover the rental cost
of the machine,

Z. The machine charge must provide the underwriter
with 2 credit for any overhead collected on these
machines for use by groups other then the undere
writers. The maximum credit which a particular
underwriter is to receive will never exceed the
cembined rental and overhead cost which they pay
each month, e.g, NSL pays $585.40 + 126,92 = $692.32.

“ith these objectives in mind, a new rate structure may be
formulated for the 604 and CPC calculators, Cale

Beye = 1612.50 + 381,98 (ho = 524.68

Discussion ef Billing Procedure

The present method of maintaining individual daily
persornel end machine time sheets cn so minimum 1/4 hour
entry basis is to be continued, Monthly statements will pe
issued to each client in the established manner, The fol-~
lowing billing procedure will be emploved,

1. All mechine rental charges are to be debited to
the Statistical Services Machine Account 1954,

Ze The machine rental charges for the 604 and the CPC
Calculators will be debited to the sponser ing
“IC preject and credited to the Machine Account 1954,
The monthly rental charges will include the special
machine overhead charge previously described,

Conclusion

This revised report differs from the proposed rate
structure report of Uctober 1, 1952 primarily in the mane
ner in which the machine charges are determined, The
present report redefines the Overhead charges and dis
tributes them between the regular ang special machines,
and the resulting rate structure has been approved by
Messrs, Little and Cusick, Correspondingly, the bills
for services rendered Since July 1 are now to be issued
using this new rate structure,

A few remarks should be made concerning the new rate
structure, First, the machine charges are reduced to a
"rock bottom" level, i,e,, the operating overhead charges
for the next fiscal period will be recovered only if the
machines experience the 23mg number of hours of use during
the forthcoming fiscal peride as they did during the past
fiscal period, If the machine use is reduced, then the
fixed overhead costs will not be recovered and an operating
deficit will result, The Administration should recognize
this Possibility and be prepared to cover the deficit should
it arise,

In the past (perhaps for Psychological reasons) I have
insisted that a factor of safety be included in the rate
structure, That is to say, the rates were set slightly
higher than the minimum required to meet the estimated
operating expenses, Correspondingly, the overall) operation


for the past fiscal Pericd sh
important thought behind th
the evaluation of an

Owed a credit balance, The

ls discussion is the fact that
equi table rate structure does involve
variables whose magni tudes must pe estimated. Since they
estimated in advance, there is a
Possibility eof error, For €xample, the estimated distribu-

tion of overhead Cosis given in Table | is subject to error,
Since there is

carnot be accurately

no previous operating experience available
for the CPC, the estimated distribution of supervision and
administration charges may be in error. (It should further
more belnoted that the $1797.75 cost of capital equipment

Is a one-time charge associated with the CPC),

In conclusion, it is evident that a close check on the
operation must be made and at the end of, 88y, six months,
the rate may be readjusted if the observed Operational
conditions indicate that this is necessary,
