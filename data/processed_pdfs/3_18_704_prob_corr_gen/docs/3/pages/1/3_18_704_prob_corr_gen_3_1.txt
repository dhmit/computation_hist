Dear Professor Morse:

We wish to thank you for making available for problem M226 sufficient
time on the IBM 704 for a limited series of runs. This series pointed up
nicely the accuracy of the particular perturbation method used and also sug-
gested a slightly different method of approach.

The expected termination date on problem M226 is July 31, 1959, and
time has already been requested for the month of July to enable completion
of the desired computations. These final computations involve a few minor
changes for the more accurate determination of the inflection points of the
computed curves.

It has occurred to us that the additional computations would be simpli-
fied if some testing time were available for the computer (Mrs. Joan Steckler)
during the alteration period. Consequently, we are asking whether or not some
additional time might be made available in the remaining two weeks of June.

Sincerely,
{ /e 2 - = ; â€˜.\
