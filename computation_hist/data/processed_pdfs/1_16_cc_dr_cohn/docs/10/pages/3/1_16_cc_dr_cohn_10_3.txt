The proof of this lemma will be deferred to the nex

t section; (see
Lemma 19. 3 below).

LEMMA 18. 3. Any tiiro neighboring Minhowskinn bases each overlap
overlapping reduced quadrnplos.

For it is the nature of Minkowski’s neighbor concept, [3], that any two
neighboring triples overlap; but by the theorem in 5 these triples are con-
tained (discounting Sign) in a reduced quadruple if they are buses.

Now we use the further information that any two Minkowskian triples
are connected by the h‘linkowski neighbor process. The proof is based on a
topological argument suggested by Minkowslri (and proved in [‘2], p. 3-12).
Since every degenerate Minkowskian triple has non-degenerate triples (i. e..
basis triples) as neighbors, it takes very little effort to deduce from the same
proof that any two Minkowskian bases are connected by a chain of )Iinlrowskian
bases as neighbors. Hence the lemmas yield the following result and with it
the “discoverability ” of all units:

THEOREM. Any two reduced guadruplos can be connected by a chain of
neighboring] (reduced) qnudruples.

19. Proximity of algorithms. In Section 5 (above) we. showed that

oll‘eot, that every ilIin/ron-sl'imz triple orurlupv u roduced quadruple. The
“inverse” seems to be false, indicating that there are “more” reduced
qundruplos than Minkowskian triples in some sense perhaps analogous to the
sense that the quadratic algorithm we introduced in 2 (above), pOssessing
“ un'diunis " in addition to regular comer-gents of the simple continued frac-
tion contains “more ” reduced triples (see Section 25 below). Lemma 18. 2
