If requested time for M.I.T. problems, per quarter, is larger
than the estimated time available, allowed times will be reduced
proportionately; each class may be reduced by a different fraction.
A small amount of time will be held back, at the beginning of each
quarter, for late applications. It is therefore important for
students needing machine time for thesis research to get their
applications in early in the spring. It should also be noted that
requests for additional time, over that allowed at the beginning of
the quarter, probably cannot be granted.

In this way the Center hopes to keep the weekly computing load
from being so great as to cause long processing deiays. It will not
cure the fact that M.I.T. has already outgrown the computing equipment
it now has. we at the Center will be glad to hear suggestions as to
how we can get the equivalent of three or more 70M's in the near future!
