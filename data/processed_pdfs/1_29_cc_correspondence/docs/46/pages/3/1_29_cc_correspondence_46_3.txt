8. D. 1. Our improved significant-figure check has permitted us to obtain
data in the two phase case for up to ten parallel servicing facili-
ties.

2., The constant holding time program is partly checked out, but we
have discovered a mistake in our numerical analysis which calls
for further theoretical work before runs are continued.

3. A Share subroutine is included.

E. Nothing short of a 70L, with double precision, would solve this ap-

parently simple mathematical problem.

F. If time for production runs can be obtained, the tables, projected
publication of which is mentioned in 3. sbove, will be run off, or
at the esrliest date such time can be made svailable. If such time

carmot be obtained, publication will probsbly have %o be abandoned.
