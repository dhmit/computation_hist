‘Dear Alan:

  

~ We would very much like to have \Mr. A. P. Ershov
come to M.I.T. We would like to have him ~
weeks and suggest August 30 through September 12. We would
be willing to pay his travel up from Durham, North Carolina
and pay for his living expenses for the two weeks here.
We would like him to give two seminar lectures here and
would beable to pay an additional F100 for them. I hope
this sort of arrangement is satisfactory.

Presumably someone will have to be responsible for
¥r. Ershov while here. Professor John MeCarthy has said he
would be glad to be his official sponsor or guide or whatever
the official term is. ~

Please let me know what further actions, official or
unofficial, will be needed from us. Do you suggest we write
Eigggg directly or will you take care of the communication
W im?

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse
Director
