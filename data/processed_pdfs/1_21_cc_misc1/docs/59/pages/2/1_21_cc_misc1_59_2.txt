. My second choice is to relinquish these two rooms effective
immediately and to ask MIT for classroom space as near to
Building 26 as possible for the 704 practical training classes.
This would average about two weeks out of each two month
period. We could get by with afternoons only. The morning
session could be held elsewhere.

I wish to emphasize that my most vital concern is the request for
Room 26-145. Any arrangement we make concerning 20C-222 and
20C-224 is of secondary importance. These latter rooms are too far
from the Computation Center to serve as '"'on the spot'' operating locations.

I trust that we can work out an arrangement whereby our shift
on the 704 can run smoothly. I know that you will consider this in your
decision.

Very truly yours,
