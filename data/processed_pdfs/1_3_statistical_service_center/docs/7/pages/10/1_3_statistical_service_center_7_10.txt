for the past fiscal Pericd sh
important thought behind th
the evaluation of an

Owed a credit balance, The

ls discussion is the fact that
equi table rate structure does involve
variables whose magni tudes must pe estimated. Since they

carnot be acCurately estimated in advance, there is a

 
 
    
   
   
 
  

Possibility eof error, For €xample, the estimated distribu=-
tion of overhead CoSis given in Table | is subject to error,
Since there is ng Previous operating experience available
for the CPC, the estimated distribution of supervision and
administration charges may be in error. (It should further-
more bqﬁoted that the $1797.75 cost of capital equipment

Is a oﬁe-time charge associated with the CPC),

In conclusion, it is evident that a cleose check on the
cperation must be made and at the end of, 84y, six months,
the rate may be readjusted if the observed Operational
conditions indicate that this is necessary,
