Method of Cost Allocation

The attached rate schedule completely describes the present
nethod of cost assessment for services performed by the Statistical
Services M. Cusick has suggested that this same method for recovering
operating costs be continued under thse Adminigtrative Services., This
method has certain advantages and a number of ‘disadvantages which I
would like to discuss prior to formal adoption,

Conclusion

The above brief description of the orgamization for the
Administrative Services must, of course, be reviewed and discussed with
My, Cusick., Every attempt should be made to determine the future
asctivity of the Admimistrative Services, thus defining the areas in
which new work is to be imitieted. This would, im turn, influence the
mmeber of pevsons and the machine complement involved,
