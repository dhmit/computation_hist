M.I.T.

Dear Professor Morse:

Professor Francis Hildebrand has concluded that he should not take on responsibility
for a television series about computers. I'm very sorry.

We have tried twice now to obtain an M.I.T. faculty member from outside the
Computation Center, and I am quite discouraged. The departments naturally have a
great deal of work for the kind of people that we want. So I'd like to urge that you re-
consider assigning someone attached to the Computation Center to assume the role of
principal spokesman to the TV audience.

So much time and thought has been invested in the general idea that I hope it will not
have to be abandoned. Everyone seems to agree that such a series is needed by the edu-
cational stations and that M.I.T. is the proper place to produce it. WGBH is convinced
that the chances of obtaining a grant for this series are excellent, but it will take several
weeks or months to prepare a presentation and get it approved, and we will not be able
to do anything this summer unless we act very quickly.

I have not devoted much time to this project thus far, but could arrange to devote
more to it. Perhaps I could help as a writer, if someone who knows the subject well
were assigned to work with me.

If it is not feasible, however, for the Computation Center to go ahead with the pro-
ject, I think we should toss the idea back to the people at Lincoln Laboratory and see
if they are still interested in developing and producing such a series.

 

Will you let me know, please, what you think should be done?
With best wishes,

Sincerely yours,
Wie (et
