Dear Carl:

The wore I see of 701 and T7O& installations, the more
I'm convinced that quieting the alr gonditioning is not a minor
problem but a real serious one, that it will require careful
treating of the ducts and probably 21so the individual wachines
if the words "demonstration area” and "instructional purposes”
are to be other than a mockery. ‘I also hear that the architects
have not yet consulted with Bolt, Beranek and Newman about this
Brun n spite of the fact that Peterson suggested this two
months Age. |

1 the main computer room ends up 1ike the ones I've
seen, with poorly des duct-work and no treatment around the
units giving rise to 70-90 db background, I'm going to refuse to
accept the installation until it is fixed--and fixing badly designed
ducts 1s always expensive!

 

Can you see whether B, B and N can be called in before
it 18 toc late?

Yours,

Philip M. Morse, Director
