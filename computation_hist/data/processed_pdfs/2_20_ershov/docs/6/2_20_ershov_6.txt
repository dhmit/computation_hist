Gentlemen:

appended are copies of correspondence to date between A.P. Ershov
and A.d. Perlis, concerning an invitation from Carnegie Institute of
Technology for his visit to the United States.

Pittsburgh, by State Department directive, is off-limits for Russian
visitors. Consequently, Ershov cannot come to Carnegie Institute of Technology.

I should like to suggest that he be invited by our three schools and
that we share his company and expenses in the United States.

I suggest an itinerary and accompanying chaperon as follows:

1. August 11 through 28, University of North Carolina —- &
Perlis and Carr,

2. August 31 through September 4, M.I,T. -~ Perlis and Morse.

Perhaps additional weeks before and after the above would be
advantageous, In any event during the three weeks, short trips could

be arranged to SSRI Centers at Philadelphia, New York,
and Washington.

Ershov would lecture at the above locations on Automatic Programming.
His English is passable and capable of quite rapid improvement.

Should you be interested in some such arrangement as the above, we
can determine the apportioning of his financial support, and the specific
arrangement of his lectures,

The Soviet Government will pay his expenses to the United States and
we should pay his transportation, living expenses and a small honorarium
for any lectures,

May I hear from you soon so that I may make arrangements with the

State Department.
Sincerel yours; ; We
