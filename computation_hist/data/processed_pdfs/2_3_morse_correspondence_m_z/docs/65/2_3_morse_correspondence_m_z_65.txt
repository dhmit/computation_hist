Dear Dr. Bauer:

C
I am one of the authors of the Pitman publication, "Faster Than
0 Thought", which you may have read. Pitmans have asked me to revise
the chapter on "Games", and I wish to include a description of the
P work done in America in applying computers to various games. Ed
Ward suggested that you could give me some information about this.
X If not, perhaps you could suggest someone else I might contact.

I would appreciate an early reply, since 1 have to complete the
revision by September 1, 1956.
Yours sincerely,

s/ Audrey Wallis
