subject: Proposal for Research and Tr&&nins Project 1n,Applied

Mathematics, using large-scale Computing Equipment,
particularly Whirlwind,

Uhirlwind PraJect has now reachad a stage of develapmant
where its potentialities ¢an be utilized, together with the other
computing equipment atArgchnology, in a_eoqr@inaped.:egqgrch and
training program, ofﬂthg“sort anticipated by ONR_ﬁur;ngits o {
severgl_years of support of_ﬁhe Project, Both the Ingtituta and |

the Navy are vital;y interested in the use of large-scale COm=~

 

puting devices ror the solution of scientific and engineering
preblems, and for the promotion of training for students inter-
ested in this field,

Of course a part of the time of Whirlwind will be used | {
for the solution of a spscial Air Force problem, and it 1is ex-
pected that the Air Force will contribute an appreciable part of
the support of the Whirlwind Project, for the development of

equipment and methods for the solution of this problem, Neverthe-

 

less, approximately half the working time of the maehine itself
will be available for the fundamental program, mentioned above and

outlined below.
