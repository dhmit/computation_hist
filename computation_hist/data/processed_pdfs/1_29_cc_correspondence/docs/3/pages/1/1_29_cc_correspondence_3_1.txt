* . Dear Mr Swan, ' 3

PR Professor Morse, who at the moment is dashing im Bl guviot
. his office at the speed of light, has asked me %o write %o you to say

* . that he would be very pleased to see you should you come to Boston -
~and of course so would I. Sl L S e N R T R e

S Al TN m .-distrésséd;- especially me ;s toleamof the circmtances |
 which bring you this side of +the Atlantic: I was very shocked. Words are
. always difficult to find on these occasions - we goj_erbend;ow*deepevat o

o, . 1 £ind it hard to believe I have beenherc a.year-_now’-?"'and
 that pretty soon I will have to start thinking about when I am going
home and just what I am going to do after that, Time goes by at an
“ineredible rate. Boston and Cambridge are quite delightful in many

ways and I would be only too pleased to suggest places for you to vigit -'f

. unfortunately I do not have a car so cannot offer to drive you around,
. . yhich T would do with pleasure if I could and had. . |

Would you like m-e'_"'t.o book 'yoﬁ'in at a reasonably priced hotel? 7
If s0, Just let me know over what dates? And if you want.to treat yourself
to a posh establishment just say and I'll get you 1nto‘ one such, |

 

T hope all goes well with the ORS, which I réemember with affection.

il Talking of dates: I have just checked with Professor Morse's secretary
and he will be out of town on the following: September 18th, 19th, 26th to Oct 3rd,
October 16th (the 12th is a publie holiday), November 7 - 9th, and the 30th. L
Nov 12th is & holiday and the 23rd would be 'poor' as it is day after Tha.nksgiving,(dv.'. 92
and December lst.

Looking forward to seeing you,

With best wishes,

Miss G.M.Heselton
Administrative Assistant
