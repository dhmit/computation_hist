Dear Frank:

Ryburn Ross, Associate Director of Libraries, has
reported to me that it was through the fine cooperation
of members of the Computation Center's staff that the
new list of serials and journals has been published in
less than half the time required for the previous edi-
tion. This new edition also has desirable features of
style, format, and readability which have been our goal

~ since the project was initiated. Without the aid of
the Computation Center, this would never have been possi-

“ble. I hope that you will pass on our appreciation to
all the members of your staff who worked with Rye: Michael
Solomita, Robert Daley, Brenda Bragdon and Diane Borsini,

The Libraries are now planning to issue an annual edi-
tion of this publication, in January. We would like to
explore during the coming months the possibility of doing
the card punching in the Libraries, using our Catalog De-
partment personnel, thus giving your hard-pressed staif
‘some relief and eliminating the present step of going from

a special 3 x 5 typed card, prepared by the Libraries, to
the punched card. This appears to be, at the moment, the
only way for us to shorten even further the preparation time.

I have enclosed three copies of the list for the use

of the Computation Center. You can have more if you would
like,

Let me say again how grateful we are for the Computa=-
tion Center's aid and cooperation.

Sincerely,
GZ
