the situation down to some sort of ”some," with more or less
, complicated rules,‘ which can he played by groups of investigators,
' to see what are the consequences or six-ions strategies. It the
"genes" are to correspond. even distantly, to some actual social
situation, the rules m: be quite complicated and the scoring
will require e great deal ofIststistical computation. It has
been found that only by the use of computing machines can the
scoring be speeded up sufficiently so that enough games can be
run through to provide an overall grasp of the situation under
study. Such ”gaming techniques" are closely related to the
experiments of Bavelas on the behavior of task-oriented groups.
The use of a properly programed computer would provide such
experiments with a powerful and flexible means of changing,
controlling, and analyzing these experiments in social psychology.
In this field we could work in close collaboration with the
‘Center for International Studies at PET and with the psychology
departments in several other colleges.
gussested Guidance m 12112 Research
The research activities or the Computation Center are

guided and coordinated by an Advisory Comittee consisting of
representatives from each of the participating colleges each
chosen by the president or their college. This Comittee provides
overall policy guidance in all activities. But to guide the work
in social science outlined above, we will need another. more
specialized group. If financial support for this activity is
forthcoming, about six top-flight social scientists from the
participating institutions will be invited to Join a special advisory
