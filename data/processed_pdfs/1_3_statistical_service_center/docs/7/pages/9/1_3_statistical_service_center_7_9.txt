Conclusion

This revised 'eport differs from the proposed rate
structure report of Uclober 1, 1952 primarily in the mane
ner in which the machine charges are determined, The
Present report redefines the Overhead charges and dis-
iributes them between the regular and special machines,
and the resulting rate structure has been approved by
Messrs, Little and Cusick, Correspondingly, the bills
for services rendered Since July 1 are now to be issued
using this new rate structure,

A few remarks should be made concerning the new rate
structure, First, the machine charges are reduced to a
“"rock bottom" level, i,e,, the operating overhead charges
for the next fiscal periocd will be recevered only if the
machines experience the 22me number of hours of use during
the forthecoming fiscal peridged as they did during the past
fiscal period, If the machine use is reduced, then the
fixed overhead costs will not be recovered and an operating
, deficit will result, The Administration should recognize
this Possibility and bhe prepared to cover the deficit should
it arise,

In the past (perhaps for Psychological reasons) I have
insisted that a factor of safety be included in the rate
structure, That is to say, the rates were set slightly
higher than the minimum required to meet the estimated
operating expenees, Correspondingly, the overail] operation
