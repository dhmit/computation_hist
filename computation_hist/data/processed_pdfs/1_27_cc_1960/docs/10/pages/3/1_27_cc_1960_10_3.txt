which enables the 704 to be used on language translation problems;
and L152, which enables the machine to handle non-ceapetationel
logic, such as algebraic and other symbolic manipulation, are
being developed and tested. The work at RIT in this field, since
ﬁhirlwinﬂ days, is Well known.

Tine-sharing Egghnigggg: we already have a typewriter connected
to the 704, which works on a time—sharing basis with our regular
operator routine, so new programs can be debugged at the same time
that regular computations are being carried out on other problems,
for example. The 704 cannot effectively accomodate more than one
or two such sa'telite channels, but the Center stafy is now at work . .
on the)design and programming required to provide a 7090 with E/O ‘égét4b
to la such "substation consoles" of various effective speeds and
capacities, which can be placed at appropriate places around LIT,

some perhaps in class rooms. LevﬂaL

grading examinations and do other clerical tasks incidental to

some of the detailed question—endwanswer interchange whicn occurs
