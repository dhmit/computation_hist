/t project 6745, direstly, it woulﬁahave to add abgu:Otlgg 000
sr to the budgets of several other of its projects at 15
aished them to continve at their present rate; for each of these
ojects, now gatting frie time on WWl, would have to sontribute
peir share directly or not have the use of WWl. But such com-
pletely piecewneal supprrt 18 not healthy for continuous operation
of a facility like Wil. The staff i1s at the mercy of chance
fluectuations of demaryis and comsequently is often tempted to take
on purely commercial computing tasks, for cutside firms, to tide

‘ggggestﬁg,gkgggggg;gggum%b =1956 - The better solution
would bc for ONR Co miake 1iUs contribution in a single sum, so that
the various ONR projrete at MIT need not pay extra for WW1l time,
and then to scherge *he nou-0NR, non-Lincoln, sponsored projects
enough for their uvwre of the facilities and staff so that Whirlwind
can afford to deveie some of its time to gencral educational re-
search without chirge. Such a system of scharging has already been
worked out and »:5 been gone over with the ONR fiscal officerss

the sharges are $250 per hour for machine time plus extra sharges
for extra time of the programming staff and for extra use of output
aquipment. (. present estimate of the number of non-ONR non-
Lineoln spor:ored projects willing and ahble to ecntribute in this
way imdicsv:3 that we should be able to carm about 60,000 during

osssible thet this fraction will increcse again as these other

srojeste come to include computer charges in their future budgets,

but 15 1s unlikely that much increase will come in 1955-1956.

Proposed Budget - With this plan of operation, the es-

timated non- incoin cost for 1955-1956 is, as mentioned, about

F160, 00C which about 60,000 should be made up by non-ONR,
