B. Fortran Programs Containing SAP-Coded Subroutines

 

SAP-coded subroutines involving no input or output
are almost directly convertible into FAP, the Fortran Assembly
Program, since the 704 instructions are (with one exception,
TQO) a subset of the 709 instructions, and FAP retains the
ma jor pseudo-ops of SAP, i.e. EQU, OCT, DEC, BSS, BES, and
BCD (n.b. the specification of BCD is slightly changed).

several pseudo-ops have been included in FAP that
make the machiline coding of IFortran programs simpler than it
was in SAP.

Programs that included input-and/or output must-

be partially rewritten using the 709 commands.
