go off-1line.

In the source deck, all READ and PRINT
statements should be replaced by

READ INPUT TAPE and WRITE OUTWPUT TAPK.
All STOP and PAUSE statements should be
replaced by CALL EXIT or CALL DUMP state-
ments, so that control can always be
returned to the Monitor. The computer
should never be allowed to stop.

Since sense switch setting and resetting
is not under programmer control, the use

of internal program pseudo-sense swilches

should replace the true sense switches.

More detalled considerations are:

1.,

The 704 feature of machine language
instructions interspersed with Fortran
statements is not possible on the 709. The
other recent extensions of 704 Fortran such
as the additional Format features, Boolean
statements, and the use of Function names as
arguments have been carried over into 709 32K
Fortran. '

Since the floating-point trap mode is normal
in the 709, Fortran automatically uses a
routine (comparable to the EFM, LFM 704
subprogram) that sets underflows to zero and
overflows to all l1l's. When an overflow

occurs, an overflow indicator is set "on",
