Dear Dr. Lelman:

Your letter of 7 May has aroused some intereet here.
We have been planning to spend some time developing machine
techniques in the social sciences as we build up the Computation
Center here. Already some of the staff are working up techniques
for application of linear programming and other related theories
to problems allied to the ones you mention. Perhaps the enclosed
description will give you an idea of some of our clans.

 

Since we are primarily an educational and pure research
institution, our work will not be classified and the important
results will be published in the usual scientific Journals. If
I understand your letter, this would not be a barrier to our worlâ€”
1ng on basic personnel problems for you, however.

 

After further discussions with the staff I will write
you in more detail. In the meantime, 1 would welcome hearing
your reaction to the enclosure and learning a bit more as to the
nature of the contract you have in mine (nature and frequency of
our reports, whether the contract could be for several years, etc.) \

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse, Director
M.I.T. Computation.eenter
