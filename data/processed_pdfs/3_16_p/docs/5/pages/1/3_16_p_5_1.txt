Dear Dr.Morse,
International Tracts in Computer Science & Technology

We have been investigating over the past few weeks
the need for an international medium for the rapid publication of
reports, review articles, monographs, reference books and symposia
proceedings, dealing with matters of interest to workers in the area
of computer design, component development, computer use, and related
fields. The need for speedy publication in this rapidly developing
field has long been apparent,and our enquiries met with strong support.

We have, therefore, decided to inaugurate such a
Series, and the purpose of this letter is to invite you to join the
Honorary Editorial Advisory Board for the Series. The editors
appointed at the time of writing are Professor N.Metropolis of Chicago
and Dr.S.Ulam of Los Alamos. Your duties as a member of the Honorary

Editorial Advisory Board will not be onerous, but it is hoped that you
will:

(a) Propose topics for books in the Series, together with
your suggestions for possible authors.

(b) Advise the Publishers from time to time at occasional
meetings and by correspondence on the editorial policy
of the Series.

Ydu will be reimbursed for any out of pocket expenses
such as postage, secretarial, etc. that you may incur during the course

cont'd..
