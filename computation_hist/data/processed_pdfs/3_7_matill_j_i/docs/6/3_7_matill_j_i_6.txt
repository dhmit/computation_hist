Professor Philip M. Morse, Director
Computation Center
M.I.T. room 6—109

Dear Professor Morse,

Plans for the meeting of college publicity here on
January 9 and 10 are proceeding smoothly, and I'm pleased
that we can count on showing those concerned with it the
Computation Center end the cooperative program with New
Englnnd colleges. I have this down for 11:30 on Thursday
morning, Jenuery 9; we will have lunch st 1:15 at the

Faculty Club, so you have as lens as until 1 o'clock if you
went it.

I shall try to hold attendance to a small number, so that
you can handle the whole group together. To this end, I
think I should have a list of colleges which are now per—
ticioating in the cooperetive program —and.which have done

so and may soon do so again. Then before we let others

attend the meeting 1 can at least be sure that representa—

tives of those schools are nocommodeted.

 

We'll be sendinm out preliminary informetion in ahout a
week, end I'd be glad to have the list before then if it
can be arranged. Do you want me to send any other in—
formntion ehout the Comoutetion Center to participants
at this stage, to save you some’time next month?
