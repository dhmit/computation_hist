Dear Professor Morse:

In accordance with our discussion at our last meeting, I am enclosing
a brief description of Subject 6.25 - MACHINE AIDED ANALYSIS - which
may be used in the Progress Report of your Machine Computation Committee.

I am not sure that the enclosed is in exactly the form you desire; however,
I will be happy to make any corrections you may suggest.

Sincerely yours,

F. M. Verzuh
Enclosure
