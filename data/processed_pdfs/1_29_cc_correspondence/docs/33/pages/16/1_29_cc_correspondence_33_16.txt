PRINT, a standard subroutine for printing SAP-formed blocks
via Fortran

SUBROUTINE  PRINT (C,N)

The dimension of € is a dunmy and can have any value in this
case

DIMENSION C(10)

Reverse order of storing data to conform

CALL FLIP (C,N)

CALL IO (C,N)

CALL FLIP (C,N)

RETURN

IEND

F'LIP reverces the storage order to.conlform to Fortran's
storage convention.

SUBROUTING WILI? (C,N)

DIMENSION C¢(10)

N2=N/2

DOSL0T= ]~ N2

TMP = C(T)

K = N=-I+1

C(I) = c(K)

C(K) = TMP

RETURN

ISND

IO outputs the N registers of array -C.
