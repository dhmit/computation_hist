re: INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTERS

Dear Professor Morse:

We are most appreciative that you have consented
to help us in finding a reviewer for the above mentioned
book by David C. Greenwood.

Dr. Locke has written to me that he has turned
the manuscript over to you, and I want you to know that
I am most appreciative for the trouble you have taken.
I merely want to take the time to write You now that
proper reviewer's fee will be paid.

Sincerely yours,
SD SRA Coteeg
