mittivity of the conducting film, go=permittivity of
vacuum, p=permeability of the conducting ﬁl{n,
uo=permeability of vacuum, and c=\./eloc1t'y of radia-
tion in vacuum. The quantity ucoa is dimensionless, and
is called “reduced conductivity per square” of conduct-
ing film. As will be seen below, it is directly related to
the optical properties of films. :

The inverse relations of Egs. (3) and (4) are given by
Egs. (5) and (6):

Defining the absorption coefficient 4 as
A=1—R-—T

and substituting for R and 7 the expressions given in
Egs. (7) and (8) produces

A/T= (wa/N)*(ucoa)*+ {1+ (2n%a*/\?) } ucoa. (9)

Equation (9) is very useful for applications in the infra-
red, for it relates the electrical conductivity of the film
directly to the absorption per unit transmission of the
film. The only condition to its application is that the
ratio of film thickness to wavelength be sufficiently
small. While reflection and transmission are themselves
extremely complicated functions of both conductivity
and permittivity of the film as demonstrated by Egs.
(7) and (8), the right hand side of Eq. (9) is independent
of the permittivity of the film, and is a simple quadratic
function of the reduced conductivity per square of film.
As the ratio a/\ approaches zero, ucoa approaches A/T
asymptotically, and ceases to depend explicitly on a/\.
Thus, for thin films, the explicit dependence of ucea on
film thickness is only very slight. This is very important
when the conductivity per square film of metal blacks
is to be determined from experimental data on A/7T, for
the density and consequently the thickness of the blacks
are not easily found accurately. The expression 4 /7=
(1—T—R)/T depends for metal blacks largely on the
transmission, and less so on reflection. This is because
blacks have rather indistinct surfaces and hence small
reflectivity. This reflectivity may be somewhat diffuse
rather than completely specular, a fact not recognized
when the measurements reported here were made. The

However, the optical constants can be calculated, where
desired, by the use of Egs. (5) and (.6). When the wave-

value for the reflection used may therefore be somewhat
low, but this error does not affect the value of A/T very
much.

November 1953 GOLD BLACKS TRANSMISSION REFLECTION IN FAR INFRARED 1116

The cases where Eq. (9) applies were solved first, and
by extrapolation from the results thus obtained first
estimates were made for the other cases. This procedure
thus yielded twenty-four values for ucoa, namely one for
each of four samples at three wavelengths, assuming
two values of the density ratio of bulk gold to gold black.
Of these twenty-four values most were assumed to be
good approximations because they were obtained from
Eq. (9) under conditions where this equation is pre-
sumably applicable. The remainder were considered
only first estimates in a series of successive approxima-
tions. The entire set of values was subjected to the
following test which served both as a check on the
approximate method, and as part of a successive ap-
proximation method where the need for more accurate
computations was indicated.

From the estimate of ucoa the optical constants # and
k were calculated, using Egs. (5) and (6). For these
calculations a knowledge of & and u is required. The
latter quantity can, for non-magnetic films, be set equal
to that of vacuum, i.e. w=uo. The permittivity of a
mixture is a linear combination of the permittivities of
the components, each component being weighted by its
relative concentration. Gold blacks consist of only a
fraction of a volume percent of gold; their permittivity
can therefore be approximated by that of air e~go. It
should be emphasized that this approximation is only
used in ftesting the applicability of Eq. (9), but never
to obtain results when Eq. (9) does apply.

Setting u=wuo and e=g, in Eqgs. (5) and (6) enables
one to obtain # and k. When » and % are known, R and 7°
can be calculated from Egs. (1) and (2); this computa-
tion was carried out on Whirlwind I, the electronic
digital computer at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. From the values of R and T thus obtained
A/T was calculated and compared with the observed
value. The values of ucoa leading to computed values of
A/T in agreement with the observed ones are listed in
Table II together with the observed and calculated
values of 4/7. Two interesting observations can be

THEORY, PART I1: RELAXATION TIME OF ELECTRONS
IN METAL BLACKS

The experimental results indicate that the conduc-
tivity at 455u is consistently higher than at 105p.
Harris and Beasly! have indicated a decreasing conduc-
tivity as the wavelength increases form 7u to 15u, this
conductivity being about 1.75 times their dc conduc-
tivity and about twice the value reported in Table II
for 105u. Thus the conductivity goes through a mini-
mum between 7u and 455u. The increase of conductivity
with increasing wavelength on the long-wavelength side
of the minimum indicates that the relaxation effect
predominates here. The decrease of the conductivity
with increasing wavelength on the short-wavelength
side of the minimum indicates that here the condenser
effect predominates. The relaxation effect therefore
appears to predominate in at least the major portion of
the wavelength region 105u <A <4355y, though the exact
position of the minimum is not known. The following
analysis shows, at least semiquantitatively, that the
condenser effect may be neglected in the wavelength
region \> 105p.

The admittance of a system of strands can be esti-
mated by an equivalent electrical circuit containing
condensers and resistors. The fact that blacks conduct
direct currents indicates that there are uninterrupted
conducting paths in the black. These paths may be
quite devious and much longer than the shortest
distance between the electrodes used to measure direct
current conductivity; they are represented in the net-
work by a series of resistances. There may be shorter
paths between the electrodes which pass through gaps
or through nonconducting impurities in the strands.
Such gaps are represented by shunt condensers in the
equivalent circuit. The admittance of these condensers is
zero for direct current, but increases with increasing
frequencies. Therefore an increasing number of paths
participate in passing current as the frequency increases,
so that the conductivity will increase appreciably when
the wave ength becomes less than a critical value Ac. At
this critical wavelength the admittance of the shunt
