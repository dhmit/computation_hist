In carrying out this procedure we use a belt containing 20 chlorided
silver electrodes, each 1 cm in diameter. The belt is fastened around the sub-
Jects! chest at a given horizontal level, and the electrocardiograms taken. We
use dual-beam oscilloscope display and a Grass camera, so have adequate sensitivity,
resolution, and frequency response in the records. A standard lead, such as limb
lead 1I, is taken simultaneously with each chest lead. If 5 different levels are
measured, we end up with 100 records. It is then necessary to choose a certain in-
stant of time, such as that corresponding to the peak of the R wave of the standard
lead, and to measure the deflections from all the records at this time. From these
data, the curves are plotted and the integrations performed. This process gives
values of Mx and My for one instant of time. We then have to choose other points
on the standard lead and repeat the whole process in order to get a complete pic-
ture of Mx and My during the cardiac cycle. The situation is actually even worse
than this, because there will be slight differences between successive electrocar-
diograms from the same lead, and one should take the average of 3 readings for
greater accuracy,.

We are also using the method to determine the heart-vector of animal
nearts suspended in a spherical plastic chamber., A rabbit heart, for example, is
suspended in the sphere on the end of a perfusion cannula. Electrodes are mounted
on the inner surface of the sphere at 30Â° intervals. The sphere is also filled with
fluid, and the entire assembly is immersed in another lucite chamber which has pro-
vision for circulating fluid for temperature control. By measuring electrocardiograms
from all 62 electrodes, we can find the three-dimensional heart-vector in magnitude
and angle. By using the 2nd moment, and taking another surface integration, the

location of the resultant dipole can also be found.
