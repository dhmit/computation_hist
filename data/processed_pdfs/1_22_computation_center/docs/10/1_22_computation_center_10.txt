Dear Carl:

The purpose of this letter is to inform you of certain
conditions in the Computation Center which are interfering with
our effective use of this area, Specifically, Rooms 26-168 ~
Staff Lecture and Conference and 26-268,270 are currently subjected
to a terrific vibration which does not permit lecturing to people
in this area. I understand this is occasioned by the York Air
Conditioning Equipment located in the basement which is "telegraphing”
vibration and sound into these rooms,

This condition is s0 severe it is impossible to lecture
to people and hence, our use is curtailed until this situation is
corrected, Mr, Collins is aware of this condition and I understand
some steps have been taken to correct this, Can you inform me of
the status of this condition,

Sincerely yours,

F. M, Verzuh
