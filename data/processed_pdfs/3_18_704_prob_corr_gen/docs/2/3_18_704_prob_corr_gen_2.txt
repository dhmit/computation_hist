Room 26-142

Dear Dr. Verzuh:

Thank you for the opportunity afforded by your letter of
April 6 to suggest a redistribution of the 840 minutes of
computer time you propose to allocate to thesis students in
the Nuclear Engineering Department during the 1960 second
quarter.

Listed below is the time requested by each student.
your initlal grant of time, and the redistribution of time
we have been able to work out after discussing each student's
situation with him and his thesis supervisor. If vou can do
80, we would like to have time allocated in accordance with
the last column given below.

Prob. Sug.
NO . Name ee 'Recuesl Gran Redlst.
J. Buckner 180 45 135
D. Goellner 120 30 5
M808 R. Hooper 25 15 15
M335 N. B. McLeod 360 180 650
M763 J. Madell 300 150 180
M842 T. MeDanlel 120 60 60
M799 J. Nelll 130 90 0
M307 M. Robkin 24.0 120 120
M824 R. Schermer 60 30 45
MOTO M. Waucaquez 240 120 150
1825 840 840

This redlstribution has been made possible by the
avallability of funds from the U.3. Atomic Energy Commission
which have been budgeted for purchase of computer time for
fuel-cycle work from GE at Lynn at commercial rates, and by
the willingness of two students, Messrs. J. M. Nelll and
N. B. McLeod, to accept the risks and inconvenience of
having thelr work done on a different, off-campus mmichine.
Time surrendered by Neill and McLeod has been redistributed
as equably as possible to the other men, taking inte account
the status of their work and their need to finish their
theses this term.


Dr. Frank M. Verzuh -2- April 7, 1960

I dislike very much having to buy computer time for
some students in order to make it possible for others to
complete thelr theses. I hope that the Computation Laboratory
can take whatever sleps are necessary to provide the computer
time needed by all MIT thesis students, on a common basis.

Very truly yours,
