analyser

in mind of constructing a differentigl
analyser which would be relatively lnexpensive,

The Macnee electronie differential
~ was bullt with the view

 

but at the same

time would have moderate accuracy, high speed of Operation,

ability to handle all types of ordinary differential equations,
and flexibility to permit the rapid investigation of wide ranges
of equation parameters ang inlitial conditions. This machine has
81x integrators, an arbitrary-function generator, and g high-
Speed multiplier. It is capable of handling ordinary differen-
€ial equations, linear and non-linear, with constant or variable
coefficlents. It can handle up to five simultaneous first-order
ordinary differential equations, or single ones up to the sixth
order. The machine flashes solutions every 1/60th of a secnnd.
The accuracy displayed is from 1 to 5%.

In sddition, a High Speed Product Integrator has been
developed which is made up of electronic differential analyser
components and a set of motor-driven potentiometers. With this,
it 1s possible to solve intemral equations of the form

b or ¥
F(y) f-f f(x.) K(x,y)dx

a

where f(x) and K(x,y) are known functions.

A one-hundred point solution is obtained every 1.67 seconds
and the solutions are displayed on a cathode ray tube screen.
Evaluation of the solutions of the Fourier, Schi8milch, and
superposition integral equations has besn considered. In the

~worst cases, the error had a maximum value of 10%, but for

s o
most cases the observed error was of the order of 2%.
