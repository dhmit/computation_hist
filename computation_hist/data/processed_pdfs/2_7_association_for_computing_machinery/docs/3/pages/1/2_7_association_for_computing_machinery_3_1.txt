Gentlemen:

I shall be glad to be of help in carrying on the informal
series of discussions between University Computing Center directors,
8ince Dr, Verzuh is Program Chairman of the ACM meeting here next
summer, it seems to be asppropriate for me to head the committee
organizing this related meeting,

A little later this fall I shall write you again so that
we can start definite planning, In the meantime, however, if you
have any suggestions asg to other possible committee members or
subject matter for the meeting or other items, I suggest you write
me with carbons sent direct to the other twe members of the committee,
In this way we can keep in continual touch,

Yours,

Philip M, Horse
Pirector
