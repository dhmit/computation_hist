part of the quotient is retained, and the remainder (which
has the same sign as the quotient) is discarded. Division
by zero is equivalent to division by one and does not

cause an assembly error.

Before discussing the precise rules for determining the

type of a non-Boolean instruction, some examples will be
considered. Suppose that Rl and R2 are relocatable symbols,
Al and A2 are absolute symbols, and Kl and K2 are common
symbols. Then O, 123, -123, Al, Al+99, 6*%Al1+A2*%Al, R1-R2,
K1-K2+3, Al/2 are all '"absolute' expressions. The expressions
Rl, R1+3, R1-7, R1+K1-K2+1, R1*5-R2*4, R2-Al*A2 are all
"relocatable', and K1, K1+3, K1-7, K1+R1-R2+1l, K1*5-K2%4,
K2-A1*%A2 are all '"common''. The precise rule for determining
the type of an expression is as follows: replace each
relocatable symbol by the letter r, each common symbol by
the letter k, and each absolute symbol by its numerical
value. This gives a new expression involving only numbers
and the two letters, r and k. If any term of this new
expression (the ''terms' are separated by plus and minus
signs) contains two letters or two occurrences of the same
letter, the original expression is illegal. Also, if a

"/" occurs in a term following the occurrence of a letter,
the original expression is illegal. After checking for

a violation of these rules, evaluate the new expression

by first performing all indicated multiplications and
divisions, then the additions and subtractions. If the
result is a number, the original expression is absolute.

If the result is r, or r plus a number, or r minus a number,
the original expression is relocatable. If the result is

k, or k plus a number, or kK minus a number, the original
expression is common. If the result is not one of these

(e.g. if the result is r+k, or 2k, or -r), the original
