0N FINITENESS CONDITIONS FOR A CONVEX BODY
HARVEY COHN

1 muoduction- In certain problems ’of_geometric number theory,
such as the study of critical lattices, it is important to know when a
ﬁnite convex body surrounding the origin Will contain no lattice
point other than the origin in Its interior. In this brief note we shall
discuss a situation in which it sud-ices to know that only aﬁZnite set of
lattice points are not interior to the body. In the companion article
[1], we shall show that the results of the present article enable us

to reduce the determination of critical lattices in (1 dimensions to a

ﬁnite number of steps.

2. Main theorem. Let K be a tonvex body in d-dimensional eu~
tlidean spate containing in its interior the hypersphere 2,,(7) of ”ﬁlms ,
and center at the origin (r<1). Let us always consrder the Late-ice of
points with integral coordinates. Then if K fails to contain in its in-
terior those lattice points (other than the origin) "1 a second sphere
24(Cd/1‘H), then it will contain in MS interior-no lattice-points at all
except the origin. In fact K will then lie entirely within the second
sphere. .

Pnoor. We shall establish the value C; = 24—‘dI‘((d+1)/2),r—<d—n/2_

We let (x4) be an arbitrary point outside of 24(7), that is, we let
Exf=R2>r€ and we join this point to its negative by a line, namely
A(xr), through the origin. We let II(x.-) be the (d—1)-dimensional
hyperplane through the origin and perpendicular to this line, and we
let 27.1.: (r; x.) be the intersection of this plane with the solid sphere
2,,(1). For our immediate purposes we deﬁne n(r; x.) as the (solid)
cone formed by the segments joining each point of 2.1-, (r; x,») with
(an); and for later purposes we deﬁne K(r; 96;) as the (solid) cone with
spherical base formed by joining with (xi) each point of 240). Now
K(r; x.) will prove useful when we seek the best Cd, since this solid
is a minimal body which any convex body K must contain in order
to contain both 24(r) and (xi). For our immediate purposes, we need
only note that the convex body K will (easily) contain x(r; at.) and
that the latter body has the very handy value wd_1r"—1R/d for its
volume, where wt=1r"”/I‘(1+k/2), the k-dimensional volume of the
unit sphere in k dimensions.

ON FINITENESS CONDITIONS FOR A coanx BODY 545

We now note that 1(7; :6.) will contain a lattice point (not the origin)
if R; Cd/rd—l. This is a simple consequence of Minkowski's theorem
on convex bodies [3, p. 60] For the body formed by the union of
K0; xi) and K0; —x.-) is symmetric and has volume not less than 2".
Hence there would have to be a lattice point. (not the origin) in each
of the two symmetric halves. From this the theorem follows easily.

3, Best constant. The preceding estimates can be improved
slightly. For instance we may take into account the fact that the
convex bodies, K(r; x.) and its integral translates, can not pack space
more densely than do the (d—1)-dimensional spheres (which are pre-
cisely their intersections with planes parallel to Il(x.>)). Then we im-
mediately obtain an improvement of C4 to Cﬁ=Cdu4_ry§‘_‘,”/’2—(“”
(where 7.1,” is the maximum euclidean distance separating the clos-
est points of any d-dimensional lattice of determinant unity). But

using even the lower estimates [2, pp. 23—24] on 7.14, we ﬁnd the
improvement is not substantial, that is, as d—>ac, log Cd~log Ci’
~(d/ 2) log (1.

Going in the other direction we can show that there is a best con-
stant for Cd as r—b0. To recapitulate, our main theorem was deduced
from Minkokai's theorem. It could also have been deduced from the
simultaneous approximation theorem, as the remaining proof will sug-
gest, but the constant C; would not have been as good. The converse
of Minkowski's theorem, or the Minkowrki-leaka theorem [4], is
inapplicable since the problem is not afﬁne invariant. The converse
of the simultaneous approximation theorem, or (essentially) Perron's
transferal principle [2, p. 67], is, however. applicable and we shall
now look to it for a proof that a best Cd, which we shall call (33',
exists.

For the calculation of the best constant, we take a minimal con-
vex body, which is “evasive" of lattice points, namely K"
=K(r; p9;/(29f)‘”), reaching to distance p from the origin in the
direction (01(=1), 02, . - - , 9.1). The at are chosen. from the Perron
transferal principle, to span (say) a real algebraic ﬁeld of degree d
(for convenience, 0 <0), g1). Then a constant gd (called Cd in [2]) will
exist with the property that “the forms ]p10k—pk| , for 2 $12 éd, admit
a simultaneous approximation no better than (gdp}“‘“’)“," that is,
for p,>P,(e), the inequality [plot—oil 2((gr+e)oi""”)“ will hold
for some 12 depending on p1 and e, and satisfying 2§k§d.

We now let p increase from 7 until it reaches the ﬁrst value pa for
which K“ has a lattice point (Pi) on its surface. If we took r small
enough (<ro(e)) then this lattice point would satisfy the inequality
