suggested that Statistical Services occupy the following space:

llx Area . Ft.)
7-303 700
7-303 1400
7-306 350
7-308 350
3-427 350
Total = 3150

This proposed comsolidation on the third floor was predicated on the
utiligation of the .C0.000.Pronmpitron and Air Filter Unit and the
associated computer room electrical power lines which were installed
by the Center of Analysis for RDA use. I feel that deecisions regarding
Space allocation should consider these items.

In sccordance with the Morse Committee's long~range computa-
tional plans, the following additional space was requested:

Bay Area (Sq. Ft.)

3-409 350
3-411 350
3-413 960

Total = 1660

This space was to be used to accomodate the large-scale conputers which
are to be installed in the not-too-distant future.

Suggested Space Allocation

It is quite evident that the space currently occupied by
Statistical Servieces (Bays 3-409, 3-411, 3-413, 3-423, 3-427 and 7-308)
are adequate for the present mode of operation. Admittedly, the long-
range plans of the Computation Committee cannot be realized in the
present space. However, it is my understanding that space for "giant
slide-rule computers” is to be provided in the new Nuclear Research
Building whieh is t0 be erected in approximately two years. It is
therefore sSuggested that Statistical Services occupy its present space
until the new building is available for occupancy. Certainly this will
eliminate any need for financial expenditures associated with relocation,
reinstallation, air conditioning, power installation, pPainting, lighting,
etc. which would naturally be associated with the proposed move tomBldg. 20,
(The cost of Féenovating two bays 3-408 and 3-411 in 1952 was $7,000 and it
seems extravagant to repeat the expense unnecessarily.)

The above Suggestion would provide Architecture with Bays 7-302,
7~-303 and 3-329 oy 2450 sq. ft.
