In accordance with ocur discussions concerning the 1list of Burgar's
Accounis which are to be used in connection with the M.I.T. Computation Center,
I have prepared the attached 1list of accounts. This list has been discussad
with Professors Morse and Floe, and Hessrs. P. V. Cusick, J. A. Little,
F. L. Foster, T. V. EBowilcik, and F. M. Verzuh, and has met with their approviel.

 

in regard to the matter of the National Science Foundation Account,
Dr. Foster insists that the NSF Appropriation remain as a2 DSR project --= s
DSR 7573 has been set up for this account. The NSF project will therefore
remain as a DSR project where charges to the account will be made from the
s M.I.T. Computation Center OPERATING Account (2756).

The Computation Center has been set up as an interdepartmental
laboratory with set of accounts analogous to that of an academic depariment, and
these accounts will be budgeted in what is commonly known es the gray folder
budget procedure. The following accounting office numbers have been assigned:
