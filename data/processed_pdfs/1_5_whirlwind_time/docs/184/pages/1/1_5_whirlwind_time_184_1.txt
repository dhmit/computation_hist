I have been authorized to credit your account with 30
minutes of machine time on the Whirlwind I computer for Problem
217 which concerns the evaluation of certain Integrals arising
in the variational treatment of atomic w:ive functions.

1f you find that you need more time, it will be neces-
sary that you submit a new request.

Sincerely,

Jack D, Porter
