THE TECHNOLOGY REVIEW

EDITED AT THE MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY

CAMBRIDGE 39, MASSACHUSETTS

October 24, 1957

Professor Philip M. Morse
Room 6-109
M.1.T7.

Dear Professor Morse:

From the description of the investigation into
"Intercollegiate Education in Machine Methods" and "Machine
Utilization" as given in the 1956-7 Directory of Current
Research, I believe that the work you are carrying on,
the former in co-operation with Dr. Frank Verzuh, might
provide excellent material for Reports on Research, whose
aims and objectives are given in the enclosed mimeographed
sheet. Accordingly, I am writing to inquire how far your
research has progressed, and whether some mention of this
work and its technological significance might not be
advisable for use in an early issue of Reports on Research.

If your research has reached the stage where it could
be reported, you might like to dictate a rough draft which
sets forth the essential facts and indicates its signifi-
cance and technological importance. It will be necessary
to look to you and your associates for all essential infor-
mation, but this office will be glad to assist in the
preparation of final copy for publication. Of course, you
wlll have opportunity to read and approve any copy prior
to publication.

If you wish, I shall be glad to discuss this matter
more fully with you at some mutually agreeable time, if
you will telephone me on Extension 879, or drop me a
memorandum in care of Room 1-281, M.I.T,.

Yours sincerely,

[Ho
