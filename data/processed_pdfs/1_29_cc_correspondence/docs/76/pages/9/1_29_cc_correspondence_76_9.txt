V. MONITOR CONTROL CARDS

All Monitor control cards must have an "*" in column 1. With the
exception of the I. D. card, the specific control instruction of
the card is punched in columns 7-72. Punching may be done accord-

ing to normal FORTRAN rules, which means that blanks are ignored.

1. Governing the Job as a Whole; Type 1 Control Cards.

a. I. D. Card. This card must always be the first card of
any job. It may have anything in columns 2-72 that the
installation's Sign-On Record is prepared to process.

b. XEQ. This card must follow the I. D. card of a job which
is to be executed.

c. DATA. This card must be placed at the end of the physically
last program of a job to be executed, preceding the data,
if any, for that job. It is not needed for non-execution
jobs.

d. CHAIN (R,T). This card is used to separate links within
a single Chain job, by specifying the tape on which the
link object program is to be stored for execution. It
must precede the physically first program (or subprogram)
of each chain link, regardless of whether the program is
a source or object program. R is a fixed point number
greater than O but less than 32768 denoting an identifying
label for the tape record which contains the link. Thus
R is the record indicator on a tape designated by T literally

either Bl, B2, or B3, (hot the logical tape units).

2. Governing Compilation of Individual Programs; Type 2 Control Cards.
The END statement for programs to be compiled by the Monitor need
not have options specified following the word END. It should be
only

END.
If no specifications are given in the END statement or in Monitor
Control Cards for a FORTRAN compilation, a standard output is

produced.
