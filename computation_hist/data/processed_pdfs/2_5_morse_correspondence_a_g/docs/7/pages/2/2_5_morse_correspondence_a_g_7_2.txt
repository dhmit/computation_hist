Dr. Philip M. Morse 2

 

I would appreciate it very much if you would write me in-
dicating whether or not you would be interested in being con=-
sidered as a prospective bidder on a contract with our organiza-
tion to study either or both of the problems described above,
attempting, if possible, to develop practical solutions which
would be some improvement over methods now employed. If you
are interested, it would be appreciated if you would tell me
briefly about the personnel and facilities available in your
organization.

In addition, I would be happy to review any proposals for
contract research in related areas in which your staff is par=-
ticularly interested and able.

This letter should not be regarded as a contract pro-
posal; it 1s intended as an inquiry about interest in and
capability for handling certain research problems for this
organization.

Sincerely,
Leiman
