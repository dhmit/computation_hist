Enclosure B, Continued

In this atmosphere and with these facilities, there is an
unparalleled opportunity to do important and basic research in
all phases of the use of digital computers in science, engineering,
and business. A central research group, supervised by faculty
members and staffed by workers picked from the graduate students
of MIT and other colleges, working closely with persons from the
other colleges, will help coordinate the work of the Center and
will carry on research of their own in machine logic, in tech-

‘niques of machine computation, and in specific applications of

machine operation to experimental and theoretical problems, thus
appreciably broadening the range of applicability of computers
in the physical and social sciences and in engineering.

It is appropriate for government agencies to help support
the research of this central research group. The group's work
will, in part, provide an expanding basis of knowledge of numbri—
cal analysis and programming techniques, which can be used by the
other participants at the Center and will, in part, break ground
in new fields of mathematical logic and methods of data processing
which will be needed in the application of digital computers to
new tas s.

Most of the senior staff for such a research group is
already aesembled at the Institute. Part of it is the group which
developed Whirlwind I programming; others are in various depart-
ments of the Institute. From time to time, some of the staff of
the participating colleges will join it for a semester or a year,
on leave from their institution, to work full time at the Center.

IBM and the Institute will contribute about a half million
dollars a year to provide the equipment, building, maintenance and
operating staff of the Center. We believe that a contribution of
about $120,000 a year will support the activities of the central
research group, which will energize and take the lead in the
research carried on at the Computation Center by students and
staff of MIT and the participating colleges. We list later in
this proposal some of the specific research projects we are pre-
pared to start on. other projects will develop naturally from
these and from the problems encountered by the other workers at
the Computation Center.

Part of these additional funds can be obtained from some
of the research projects which will use the facilities of the
Center. 'Although the use of the machine itself will not be
chargeable, most users will need advice from the Center staff as
to preparing their programs, will need help in detailed coding
and will prefer to have our staff carry out many of the actual
runs on the computer. This will add to the duties of the staff,
and part of the_additional cost will be charged to those projects
which can afford this extra service. Those students and faculty
members who cannot afford to pay for this help will be able to
use the machine, but will be expected to do their own coding,
