(3) Procedure

The specimen, heater core, thermocouples, and insulating
cover are assembled as shown in Figs. 3 to 5. Alundum ce-
ment is used to protect the platinum winding on the heater
core. The position of the thermocouple beads within the
specimen is checked by means of a radiograph. Radiographs
are also used to locate flaws within specimens, and to insure
correct positioning of the core within the specimen.

The potential differences across thermocouples are measured
with the potentiometer after the specimen has attained ther-
mal equilibrium. A Weston Model 310 wattmeter, Form 1,
is emploved in measuring the power input. The semifocal
length of the specimen is determined before it is assembled.
From the radiograph the thermocouple distances are obtained.

Equation (21) is employed to determine the thermal con-
ductivity. Once the body factor which embraces the loga-
rithmic term in equation (21) 1s calculated, it remains constant
for a particular specimen. Only the power and temperature
drop need be ascertained for further conductivity determina-
tions on that specimen.

VI. Results

Four different specimens and fifteen separate runs were
employed in making the alumina determinations of conductiv-
ity. The values range from 0.0225 at 500°C. to 0.0125 at
1300°C. A representative curve for an alumina specimen is
shown in Fig. 6.

The zirconia values were obtained from two specimens and
five runs. As this material becomes a noticeable conductor of
electricity above 800°C., very fine insulators were placed both
on the thermocouple leads and on the heater leads. This
permitted satisfactory determination of thermal conductivity
up to a temperature above 1300°C. The values are practicallf\r
linear from 0.004 at 100°C. to 0.005 at 1300°C. Values for -8.
zirconia sample are plotted in Fig. 6.

For the magnesia conductivity determinations three speci-
mens and six runs were used. No effect on the conductivity
values was noticed for the hydrostatically pressed sample.
Conductivity values for magnesia extend from 0.040 at 400°C.
to 0.014 at 1300°C. TFigure 7 contains a typical curve for a
magnesia specimen.

Three specimens and three runs were employed
in the thoria dcterminations./ The thermal con-
ductivity decreases from a value of 0.014 at
300°C. to a value of 0.005 at 1300°C. Values
for a thoria sample are included in Fig. 7.

The values for the beryllia specimen decrease
from 0.17 at 400°C. to 0.040 at 1200°C. The
curve for these values appears in Fig. 8. This
curve is extended to include some low-tempera-
ture values for beryllia previously reported
bv Scholes.* Curves of magnesia, alumina,
thoria. and zirconia are also included in this
figure for comparison.

For the insulating firebrick B & W K-28
employed as a specimen cover in this investiga-
tion, the conductivity values increase from
0.00063 at 300°C. to 0.001 at 750°C.

VIl. Discussion

(1) Comparison with Previous Investigations

The values for alumina obtained by Gerdien?

from Jakob and Hahnlein are from 15 to 25%

1400 lower than values obtained in the present inves-

tigation. There appears to be no apparent

reason for the difference. Eucken’s” values for

alumina are from 25 to 479% low. This is

probably due to the fine, hairlike cracks or

pores in his alumina sample. His values

for magnesia agree to within 3 to 7%, of those reported in this

study. This agreement is remarkable when it is remembered

that he arrived at his values by calculation and prediction

from his own equations relating porosity, glassy-phase com-

position, and thermal conduction for commercial-type brick.

Whittemore® has approximately the correct magnitude for

his relative conductivity values for magnesia, alumina, and

stabilized zirconia. Further comparison was not made as

his measurements were made by Wilkes on commercial-type

refractory oxides of much higher porosity than those employed
in the current investigation.

With the aid of equation (1) and specific-heat data from
Kelley,® the thermal diffusivity data of Fitzsimmons® can
readily be converted into thermal conductivity values. His
magnesia values are 15 to 329, low. The alumina values are
4 to 8% low. The zirconia values are in good agreement.
This order of deviation is to be expected since he has assumed
an infinite coefficient of heat transfer between the specimen
and its surroundings.

(2) Errors, Deviations, and Stabilization

Errors in power and temperature measurement are con-
siderably higher at the low end of the range of temperature
measurement where the drop is about 5°C. as compared with

the high end of the range where the drop is about 50°C.
Probable errors are as follows:

Low end High end
of range of range
P: Instrument +1 507 +0 39
Stabilization +1.0 s 10
AT: Potentiometer +4 0-8 0 +1.0-2.0
Thermocouple calibration +92 () 0.7

Maximum total instrument error

+8.5-12.5 +3.0-4.0

Deviations from the mean curve may be calculated by
means of equation (2). These have been determined for six
separate runs (66 values) with three magnesia samples. The
standard or mean deviation is 7.29, for the entire range. The
maximum deviation encountered was 13.89,. At the low
end of the range the deviations tend to increase.

‘{quation (3) may be used to estimate the standard error
of the mean value at any point. The relation to the number
of runs is as follows:

No. of runs Standard error of mean

1 7.2
2 5.1
3 4.2
4 3.6
5 3.2
6 2.9

On the basis of this, the mean curve of three separate runs
should give absolute values of thermal conductivities well
within 59, provided radiographs reveal no misalignment or
flaws.

The attainment and stabilization of thermal equilibrium is
generally realized within 2 hours. Sometimes equilibrium is
attained in about !/, hour. An investigation of the stabiliza-
tion of thermal conductivity over a long time period of days
reveals that it is very good at the low end of the range. At
the high end of the range the conductivity increases slightly
with time. This is due to the deterioration of the core wind-
ing at high temperatures.

Errors of misalignment of the thermocouple beads or heater
core and flaws in specimens are detected by means of radio-
graphs. Confocality errors are minimized by careful in-

VIll. Conclusions

(1) An apparatus and method for determining the ab-
solute thermal conductivities of refractory materials in the
low and intermediate temperature ranges have been described.
The envelope type of test is employed with a prolate spheroi-
dal specimen.

(2) Alumina thermal conductivity decreases from 0.0225
at 500°C. to 0.0125 at 1300°C.; magnesia decreases from
0.040 at 400°C. to 0.014 at 1300°C.; zirconia is practically
linear from 0.004 at 100°C. to 0.005 at 1300°C.: thoria de-
creases from 0.014 at 300°C. to a value of 0.005 at 1300°C.:
beryllia decreases from 0.17 at 400°C. to 0.040 at 1200°C.;
and insulating firebrick B & W K-28 increases from 0.00063
at 300°C. to 0.001 at 750°C.

(3) Two conditions must be met to insure unidirectional
heat flow: (a) the heater core must be so constructed as to
generate heat uniformly per unit length along the axis of ro-
tation; (b) the specimen must be so designed and shaped that
its inner and outer surfaces are confocal with the surface of
the core.

(4) The standard per cent error of the mean is 4.2 for
three runs. Since three or more runs have been made in
these conductivity determinations, it is believed that the
values obtained are well within 4=59, of the absolute values
of thermal conductivity.

(5) If suitable high-temperature thermocouples and
heater windings become available, the temperature range of
this method can be extended.
