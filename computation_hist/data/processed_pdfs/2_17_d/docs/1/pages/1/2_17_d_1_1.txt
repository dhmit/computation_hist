Dear Phil:

As you know, the LNS has for some time been considering what it must do

to satisfy its members' growing computer needs. Our best current estimates
are that we shall require, starting this coming summer, about one full shift
of 7090 for ordinary computing and, assuming that Pless's PEPR works
(Precision Encloding and Pattern Recognition device for analyzing Bubble
Chamber Photographs), another full 7090 shift on line with PEP R.

We have been trying to decide what is the most reasonable method for
satisfying these needs. Our problem is aggravated by the fact that the
various individuals in LNS with appreciable computer needs all feel very

strongly concerning what they regard as the necessary computer attributes.
These include:

. Prior scheduling of shutdowns;
. Accessibility to prime time;
Regular scheduling of running hours;
. Control of the monitor system to enable
a) debugging on line,
b) unrestricted-length runs;
. Direct access to the input-output;
. Possibility of handling occasional peak loads.

It is clear to us that all of these needs could not possibly be satisfied by any
computer facility, existing or contemplated. However, to satisfy as many as
possible it now appears to us that running our own computer might come closest,
at least for some time in the immediate future. Thus, e.g. , we are considering
the rental of a 7040, with the possibility either ofbconverting to a 7044 or to a
7090, or of joining the joint computer facility in a few years.

We would appreciate your reactions to these ideas and, in particular, whether
you believe that the Computing Center is or will be in a position to satisfy the
Laboratory's computational needs, as outlined above, in the near future.

Sincerely,
