3. Other Control Cards

a. There is another Monitor Control Card, FAP.
FAP. This card is placed immediately before the FAP
symbolic cards that are input to the Monitor. It specifies
that those cards are to be FAP assembled. The FAP card
follows any Type 2 Monitor control cards that may be
used.

b. Other cards, not strictly control cards, may be input to
the Monitor.
Cards with an asterisk in column 1 may be included with
the control cards, but their information field will be
treated in the manner of comments. They will be printed

on-line at the point where they are read.

PROGRAMMING FORTRAN PROBLEMS FOR THE MONITOR.

This section deals with programming in the FORTRAN language.
However, the same requirements, as reflected in machine language,
apply to FAP assembly programs as well, and to input object

programs resulting from a previous symbolic assembly program.

In general, all ordinary FORTRAN problems may be used with the
Monitor. There are, however, three relatively minor ways in

which Monitor FORTRAN programs must differ.
1. Differencés Concerning Tape Usage:

a. BCD Tape. (1) All input BCD data must be called by
the statement READ INPUT TAPE { , n, LIST. Output
is effected by a WRITE OUTPUT TAPE A, n, LIST state-
ment, where ¢ and (4 are the proper logical tape
designations for tapes A2 (input) and A3 (output),
respectively. (2) If BCD information is to be written
for intermediate storage during program execution, 2a
tape not used by the Monitor must be used (or one the

programmer knows the Monitor is not using).
