Dear Mr. Lowe:

This letter is in answer to your of November 1 to
Professor W. T. Martin of the Department of Mathematies. The
Institute is of course aware of the need for training persons
in the use of high-speed computing equipment. We have here an
intensive program of education in this field involving nearly
a dozen courses, a spectrum of assistantships and a professional
seminar in the subject. Consequently, I am not sure that we are
quite in the position of needing a "sales talk" as to the
importance of this fleld. We have one and willl shertly have
two nigh-speed computers and our students have access to these
machines. Consequently, & highly technical talk on specific
uses of machines or on special programs which might be used on
machines such as the IBM 704 might be of interest in our
seminar. If one of your technical experts on machine use has
some material of this sort, we would be interested to have him
address our seminar some time in the Spring. EBefore we can
schedule such a talk, however, I would suggest that the person
whe might come should write to me outlining the proposed sub-
jeet matter and suggesting a possible title. :

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse, Director
M.I.T. Computation Center
