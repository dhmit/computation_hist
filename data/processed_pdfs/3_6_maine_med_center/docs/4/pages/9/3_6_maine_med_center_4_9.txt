The lower resistivity in the heart area, therefore, has a complicated effect on
the internal potentials.

previously. Schwan'® has presented evidence that the blood has one tenth
the resistivity of the tissues surrounding the heart. Using a resistivity ratio

Further work is necessary in three dimensions to test the tentative conclu-
sion that the effect of the highly conducting blood inside the heart is uniformly
to scale down the surface electrocardiograms. If this proves to be correct it
will be necessary to multiply the observed magnitude of the heart vector by a
factor that depends on the ratio of the resistivity of the tissues surrounding
the heart to the resistivity of the blood.*

* Subsequent to the presentation of this article, experiments with dog hearts* have indi-

cated that the reduction is uniform at remote points, but is variable in the vicinity of the
heart.
