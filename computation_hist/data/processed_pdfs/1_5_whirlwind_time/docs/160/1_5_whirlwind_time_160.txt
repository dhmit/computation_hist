Dear Mr. Porter, :

The Operations Research Group is interested in evaluating the state
probabilities of a very general multi-phase multi-channel waiting line
problem, It sppears that the solution is feasible with tae aid of WWI.

The initial phase of this problem will require ebout three (3)
hours of computer time and will be programmed by Robert Oliver of the
O.R. Group.

The 0.R. Group would appreciate the availability of this amount of
time.

If the initial calculations are satisfactory, more time will be
requested for the complete solution of the problem.

Sincerely,

P.M. Morse
