LOEB 18 A ALOUNOL Ul ii Ges ya OE SR graduate
program offered at MIT in the area of Operations Resesarci,

In a manner of brief introduction, I am an Assistant
Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Clarkson College of
Technology. Having recently completed an 1S degree under
Prof, Andrew Schultz, Dept. of Industrial and Engineering
Administration, Cornell University, I have become more and
more interested in the breadth of industrial problems
that are being solved and will be solved by techniques
associated with Ovserations Research,

Could you forward some details about your program ?
I realize that such information would have to be of a
rather general nature, It is likely that I shall be in the
Bo: ton vicinity some time during August, Perhaps at that
time we might be able to discuss your program in further detail
at your coaveaience,

Thank you, I shall look forward to seeing you soon,
Sincerely,

ik lor

James I, Moors
