some of the remarks about functions might not
hold if we tried to consider equality a single
predicate defined on all spaces at once,

A form with values in T such as
x <y,x=y, or prime(x) is called a propositional
form, e

Prop031tiona1 forms constructed directly
from predicates such as prime(x) or x <y may be

called simple, Compound propositional forms can
be constructed from the single ones by means of
the propositional connectives A \/;L,Q,u We
shall assume that the reader is familiar with the
use of these connectives,

Condxtional Forms or Conditional Expressions,
Conditional forms require a little more careful
treatment than was given above in connection
with the example, The value of the conditional
form (Dl-*-el.---pn"*'e )
is the value of the e corresponding to the
first p that has value T; if all p's have value
then the value of the conditional form is not
defined. This rule is complete provided all the
pP's and e's have defined values, but we need to
make provision for the possibility that some of
the p's or e's are undefined. The rule is as
follows

1t 1s natural to ask if a function cond

of 2n variables can be defined so that

(pl —)el,...pn _)en) ~— Condn(pl,ooo,pn,

l,...’e)

This is not possible unless we extend our notion
of function because normally one requires all
the arguments of a function to be given before
the function is computed, However, as we shall
shortly see, it is important that a conditional
form be con51dered defined when, for example,

p1 is true and € is deflned and all the

other p's and e's are undefined, The re-
quired extension of the concept of function would
have the property that functions of several ;
variables could no longer be identified with f
one-variable functions defined on product spaces,
We shall not pursue this possibility further
here,

We now want to extend our notion of forms
to include conditional forms, Suppose

pl,...,pn are forms associated with the space

et T —

of truth values and € ,...e are forms i

associated with the same space V. Suppose
further that each variable xi occurring in

p pn and el,...en is associated with the

l)...

with the space U, Then (pl —+el,...,pn —+en)

is a form associated with V,

We believe that conditional forms will
eventually come to be generally used in mathe-
matics whenever functions are defined by con-
sidering cases, Their introduction is the same
kind of innovation as vector notation, Nothing
can be proved with them that could not also be
proved without them, HHowever, their formal
