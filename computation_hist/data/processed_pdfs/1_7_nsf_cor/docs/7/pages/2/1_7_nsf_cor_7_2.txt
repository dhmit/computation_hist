Extension of NSF G2%40 Page 2

Plans for Next Year

 

A1l of these projects, and more, will stretch the capabllities
and energies of the Computation Center staff. We expect to add
two more senlor staff members this summer and hope to persuade two
men now completing their Doctor's degrees to stay on as junior
staff members for a year or two. It is certain that most of the
 pesearch subjects outlined in our original proposal to NSF will
be begun this coming year; it can be expected that the NSF portion
of support for this work will reach the yearly rate of $35,000
as indicated earlier, and it is expected that this yearly rate
will continue at about the same level for several further years,
as was foreeast in our original proposal (see Enclosure B).

We therefore reguest that Grant NSF G2040 be extended to
June 30, 1958, with additional funds of $13,000.
