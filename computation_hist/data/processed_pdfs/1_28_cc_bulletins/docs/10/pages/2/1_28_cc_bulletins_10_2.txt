New FAP

There is a new version of FAP described in the
IBM 709/7090 DPS Bulletin Fortran Assembly Program (FAP)
for the IBM 109éZOQOz J28-6098-1 which is available in
he Consulting Room, 206-153. is version, which
includes the new psuedo-ops MAX, MIN, OPD, etc., will be
on our system tape within the next month. The present

version of FAP is a subset of this new version and no
changes need be made to present programs.

Fortran(EAP;Monitor-Sxétém Changes

Several changes of interest have beenh made 1in the
past few months:

June 20, 1961 New version of (F2PM) that supersedes
all existing versions. New (F2PM) is
one complete subprogram and allows
symbolic breakpoint post-mortems
called by CALL FTNBP (see CC-167,
Supplement 1).

Due to6 the pending addition of MAD to
the system tape, the following .
necessary revisions have been made:

BSS revised to accept MAD
compiled subprograms,

Library subroutines revised so
that they may be called by either
Fortran or MAD compiled programs,

Subprograms BCDIO, BINIO, TPMOV,
SETUP, and LISTM added to the
library. These routines perform
BCD input/output, binary input/
output, fape manipulation,
Initialization of FFT and F2PM
and do list manipulation for MAD
programs,
