Subject: Proposal for Research and Training Proj eat in Applied

Mathematics, Using Large-Scale Computing Equipment,

‘Partioxﬂarly Whirlwind ’

Whirlvﬁnd Project has now reached a stage of development.
where its potentialities can be utilized, together with the other
computing equipment at'Technologr, in a coordinated research and
training program, of the sort anticipated by OER during its several
years of support of the Project. Both the Institute and the navy are
vitally interested in the use of large-scale computing devices for the
solution of scientific and engineering problems, and for the. promotion
of training for students lnterestod in this field.

of course a part of the time of Whirlwind will be used for
the solution of a speclal Air Force problem, and it; is expected that
the Air Force will. contribute an appreciable part of "plus support of

‘ the Whirlwind Project, for the clevelopmen‘c. of equipment and methods
for the solution of two problem. Nevertheless, approximately half
the working time of the machine itself will be available for the funda-

mental program, mentioned above and outlined below.
