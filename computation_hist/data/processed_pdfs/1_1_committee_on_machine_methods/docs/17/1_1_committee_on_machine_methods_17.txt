Minutes of the Seventeenth Meeting
of the
Committee on Machine Methods of Computation

May 16, 1951

gergogg. Present: C. 1;. Adams, Z. Kopal, C. Lin, P. M. Morse and
E. Reissner

The final list of appointments for research assistantships
for next year was discussed. Kopal reported that Mr. Taylor, who
would have been appointed to the Electrical Engineering Depart-
ment, has relinquished his assistantsﬂp and is coming from
England on a special mush scholarship. Consequently, there is,
at present, no appointment from the Electrical Engineering De-
pertinent.

Reissner reported that Mr. Hicks is coming as an assistant,
‘ but that Oliver Smith had relinquished his appointment. However,
he recommended that Mr. W. V. Caldwell and Mr. P. T. Hsu be ap-
pointed as half—time assistants from the Mathematics Department.
This was approved by the Committee and it is understood that the
Mathematics Department will write these applicants. The case of
Mr. Rosenblum was again considered and it was finally decided not
to appoint him. Consequently, the Math. Department has three
assistants appointed at present —- Hicks, Caldwell and Hen.

Morse reported that, at present, there are four gore—doctoral
research assistants appointed in Physics —- Corbaté, Hewstein,
Sartori and Miss Altman; that there is one post—doctoral —- 801
I. Bubinom He recommended that one further appointment be made
~- Hr. Aaron Temkin. This was approved by the Committee. If Mr.
Temkin accepts this will make five rare—doctoral appointments and
one post-deetoral appointment from Physics.

I": was suggested that the next meeting of the Committee be
some time before the tenth of June, and that if any member of the
Committee had business to take up, he should notify the Chaimah.
