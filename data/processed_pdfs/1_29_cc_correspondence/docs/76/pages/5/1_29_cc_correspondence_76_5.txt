The input subprograms may be FORTRAN subprograms, FAP
subprograms, or binary object subprograms. Data cards,
to be used during execution, follow the input sub-
programs. The input program consists of a single main
program-subprogram sequence not larger than the available
core storage and constitutes a "machine-load".

A sequence of input programs meant for execution where
each input program is a job of type 4, The data cards
are placed at the end of all the input programs. This
is called a CHAIN job and each of the jobs of type 4
is a CHAIN LINK. This permits a single object program

execution to consist of more than one "machine-load''.

I11. MONITOR FEATURES

The first record of each job must be an identification
(I. D.) card whose format is specified by each com-
puter installation.

There is a complete set of control cards for the Monitor.
These are distinguished by an asterisk (k) in column
one. In general, they are of two types: 1) to govern
the job as a whole, telling what it consists of, and

2) to govern options in the output.

The FORTRAN Monitor System uses eight tapes on two
channels. These are Al, A2, A3, A4, Bl, B2, B3, B4 .

A2 is the input tape and A3 is the output tape. Tt
should be noted that the correspondence between logical
tape designations used in FORTRAN Source program in-
put/output statements and the actual tape assignments
at object time is set in the Unit table (IOU) in the
FORTRAN library. Each installation may alter the
logical correspondences.

FORTRAN programs written for use under Monitor control
will be the same as conventional FORTRAN programs with

three exceptions.
