Dear Dr. Jsstrow:

Thank you for your letter to Professor Morse
offering mathematicians an opportunity to Join your
start.

We have placed a notice of this opportunity in
a prominent position in our Center where interested
persons are likely to see it. We feel that this
procedure is best inasmuch as graduate students who
are at all stages of progress in many departments will
see this notice.

Sincerely,

F. J. Corbato
