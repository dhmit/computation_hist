‘l'he high-speed computing facility, to be installed by
Ian at the new Computation Center at MIT will be the largest and
most flexible facility in this country to be devoted exclusively
to unclassified research and education. IBH'will contribute more
than a fifthantaa million a year in its support for maintenance
and operation. what is needed, in addition, to make this an
outstanding center for the intestigation of digital computer
potentialities in all branches of scientific research, is about
$100,000 a year for the support of a research staff, which can
work with scientists in various fields to develop new and more
effective techniques of machine utilization.

Arrangements have been made for all the colleges in
New England to participate in the use of the machines, and IBM has
set up made for Assistantships to enable graduate students, at
MIT and at the participating colleges to spend time at the Center,
learning to use the equipment. :i'her installation is expected to be
completedrby February 1957. Details at the installation and or
arrangements with the participating colleges are given in Enclosures
3 and C to this proposal. This Center and these arrangements
represent potentialities for new developments in social and physical
science of great and unexplored importance.

There will be no charge, for machine time, made to students
or faculty of the participating institutions. Maintenance and the
