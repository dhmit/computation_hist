Dear Professor Cheston:

I am taking the liberty of answering your recent letter to
o Proiessor lMorse inasmuch as he is presently on an extended trip.

It is true that an IBM 7090 will be installed at the Computation
Center this coming December or January, (We Presently have a 709) However,
this will not be a purchased machine, Rather, MIT operates the computer
for the benefit of its own faculty and students as well as the over-thirty
participating New England colleges and universities, In return, IBM supplies
the use of two shifts on the computer,

Consequently, the decision to obtain a 7090 was not as free a choice
Y as the one you are currently making, but it still has not prevented us from
drawing some coaclusions of the relative merits of the 709-90 systems,

1., The relative short word lengths (36 bit words)

which on long floating-point calculations may cause

gradual degradation of accuracy;

2, The small 32K memory. I use the term "small”

here because as one's programming ability arises and

operating procedures become more sophisticated, the

32K core becomes crowded, Nevertheless, this

should not be considered too serious a defect unless

one is doing complicated programming,

The principal advantages that we see with the 709 or 7080 are:

1., The compatibility with many similar machines which
not only allows the benefit of exchanging work with
other installations, but has the more subtle effect

of allowing undesired projects an opportunity to do
their work elsewhere,
