Subject: T09-7090 Program Conversion

Although the 709 and 7090 are in most respects
program compatible, there are some changes that you
should make to your 709 programs to insure proper,
operation on the T7090. Somewhat in order of importance,
these are described below,

FMS MAIN Subprograms

The internal interval timer and clock which we
will have on our 7090 uses location 7 as its trapping
location. This location has been the manual restart
entry point for F2PM and all Fortran main subprograms
compiled before November 1, 1961 and most FAP main
subprograms contain the five instruction sequence

CLA {Fer
STO
STZ 4 )-20
CLA (F2PM
STO 7

or its equivalent. The last instruction of this
sequence should be changed to

STO 36

where 36 is an absolute non-relocatable decimal
address. If you are re-assembling a FAP main
subprogram the entire sequence may be replaced by

TSX $.SETUP, 4

which is what Fortran now compiles. .SETUP is a
library routine which performs the necessary
initialization of (FPT) and (F2PM). Since .SETUP
may be expanded or changed at at any time it is
suggested you always use the library tape version.

For those user's who may need to know operating
procedures the console restart procedure, making a
manual entry to F2PM 1s:

STL 3519
TTR 364,

Scope Programs

The cathode ray tube on the T7090 will be connected
to channel A and will be controlled through channel
commands. Present scope programs using "copy logic"
must be converted. The Center is converting those
routines which are on the library tape.

Off-line Tape Processing

It is expected that our 1401's will exactly
simulate our present off-line tape processing
equipment except that:

â€”"_11) SALIng will be done with progvan
controlled carriage spacing,

2. All card-reading will insert the "ook-
ahead bits" in the tape record,

3. Space-suppress may be different.

At the moment, we would suggest no changes to
your programs unless you do not print under program
control.

Tape Assignments

The following is the anticipated FMS tape
assignment. The anly changes are the reassignment
of the library tape and the addition of tapes 1ll
and 12 to the system.

Tape. Density

High-density will be the standard case for tapes
at the Center. It is expected that FMS users will be
able to set tapes 9, 10, 11 and 12 to low-density
by means of an FMS control card and therefore need
to make no program changes. Non-FMS users may have
to insert set density instructions into their programs
in order to read their present tapes.
