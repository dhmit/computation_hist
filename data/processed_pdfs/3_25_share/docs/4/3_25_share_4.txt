Airoraft (3 pagee).

We very mueh appreciate receiving this material for the SHARE
program end hope before too long we will be able to contribute
gome ourselves.

he recent letter I received from Fletcher Jones, he informe
me that there are Proceedings for the three preceding SHARE meetings

rumen Hunter was up here and he also fell that you migh® bs akls ¢o

available which you could send to us? I wonder if you have any
