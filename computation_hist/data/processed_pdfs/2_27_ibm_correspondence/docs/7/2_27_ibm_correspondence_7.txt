Dear Father Maxwell:

it is with a great deal of pleasure that I enclose our check
for $800.00 representing the first semester portion of the stipend
for the IBM Research Associate recently appointed for the 1959-60
school year in connection with the M.I.T. Computation Center. A
detailed description of the appointment is attached.

The increasing use of the IBM 704 Computer at M.I.T. by
the New England colleges both as an educational device and a research
tool has been very encouraging to IBM, and we are delighted that
Boston College is having an active part in it as represent ed by this
