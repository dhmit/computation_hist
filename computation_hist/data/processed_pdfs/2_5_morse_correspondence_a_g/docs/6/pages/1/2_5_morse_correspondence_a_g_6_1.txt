Dear Dr. lLelmani

vour letter of 7 May has arcused soune interest here.
We have been planning to spend some tlme developing machine
techniques in the soclal sciences &s We build up the Computation
Center here. Already some of the staff are worklng up techniques
for application of linear prograrming and other related theorles
to problems alllied to the ones you mention. Perhaps the enclosed
deseription will give you an idea of some of our pians.,

 

 

| gince we are primarily an gducational and pure research |
institution, our work will not be clagsified and the important
regulte will be published in the usuti gecientifiilc Journals. If

T understand your ietter, this would not be a barxier HO our HOrk- |
, ing on basic personnel problems Lor you, however. \

After further discussions with the astaff I will write
you in more detall. In the meantime, 1 would welcome hearing
your reaction to the enclosure and lesarning a blt more as to the
nature of the contract you nave in mina (nature and frequency of
our reports, whether the contract cculd be for several years, etc.) \

SincÂ¢erely,
