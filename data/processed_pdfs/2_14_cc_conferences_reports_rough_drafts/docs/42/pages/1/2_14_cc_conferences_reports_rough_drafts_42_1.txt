Those present included (see 1list of persons who attended taken by Verzuh)

Morse opened the meeting at 10:00 a.m. in the Science Library
conference Room. He brought out that the meeting was the first one
of a series wherein it was desired to exchange 1ideas and not Jjust
discuss explicit® simulation problem.

Galliher firstly presented some material and discussed 1
simulations they are doing and thinking about, and in addition, to
<ome of the problems he felt were worth doling. He brought out that
the group he headed was an interdepartmental group at M..[.E.~0f
graduate students interested in operations research. He outlined
three different problems: (1) a systems inventory problem, (2) a

general purpose finite population waiting-1line problem, and (3) a

 

 

traffic flow problem; the first two be classified as stochastic

 

Markov processes and the third he described as perturbations of a
deterministic system. In discussing problem 1 he brought out the
problem of sampling exponential distributions and discussed the merits
of table look-up versus generation. Under problem 2 he discussed

the explicit problem of machine repair and discussed a procedure of
solution wherein the bookkeeping of the stochastic simulation 1S
maintained by means of a "tpansaction table". As a sample of the
third type of problem, he quoted that of tunnel flow in one of fthe
tannels leading into New vork. He discussed the fact that measured

tunnel flow does not agree with that which would arise from a
