contemporary economic problems can be considered.

The goal or our Center is not to coupeve as s dial scientists
with activities such as those listed but re her to contribute from ‘
the computational expert side towards the inclusion or modern computing '
machines in social science research.

Professor Orcutt has said thst he will be glad to amplify any or
the above topics which I have attempted to summarize, (any distortions
are mine). Due to the press or time before your December 3 meeting,
his phone numbers are: (office) KIrkland 7-7600, extension 2550; (home)

If I can be or any further assistance, please do not hesitate to
contact me.
