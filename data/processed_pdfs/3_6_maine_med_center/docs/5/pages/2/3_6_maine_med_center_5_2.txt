this cause would tend to make the differences between
the potentials with the two fluids smaller rather than
larger. In order to standardize the records., they were
scaled down to correspond to a dipole excitation strength
of 1 ma-cm. The low resistance fluid causes an apparent
change in the angle « of 35°.

With a tangential dipole, there is a uniform lowering
of field potentials with the low resistance fluid, but for
other angles, the potentials are increased In some areas
and decreased in others. These results can be readily
visualized by means of the method of images, e.g., for a

radial dipole, the image dipole inside the highly conduct-
ing sphere will be pointed in the same direction as the
external, real dipole. The image dipole will therefore
reinforce the real dipole at most points, but in a region
between the two dipoles, the image will counteract the
real dipole.

These effects were shown more strikingly in the ex-
periments with a metal sphere in the tank. Although
the resistance of metal is very much lower than that of
electrolytes, it can be shown theoretically that the effect
of the metal sphere on field potentials should not differ
too greatly from that due to a sphere having a resistivity

 

one-tenth that of the surrounding fluid. Figures 3, 4,
and 5 show the horizontal wall distributions for dipoles
at angles of (° (tangential), 45° and 90° (radial) to
the surface of the metal sphere. Curves E, ©, and 7T,
with the sphere out of the tank or at an infinite distance
from the dipole, correspond to a homogeneous medium.
In each case, the dipole was kept fixed in position, and
the sphere was moved away from the dipole. The effect
of the sphere becomes greater as it approaches the dipole.

In view of these results, we conclude that the presence
of the relatively highly conducting blood inside the heart
chambers may have a significant effect on the valves of
the recorded potentials. We also postulate that the fact
that subepicardial potentials are recorded with much
smaller amplitudes than epicardial potentials may be
explained by (a) their greater distance from the record-
ing electrode, and (b) by the greater shunting effect of
the cavity blood on these components. This would cer-
tainly be true for any tangential spread of excitation on
the endocardial surface, but for a purely radial dipole,
the potentials should be increased.
