Dear Mr, James:

We will be glad to have you visit us during your stay in
the States in the latter part of June,

As far as we can see now, either the nineteenth or the
twentieth would be satisfactory. It would help us, however, if you
could let us know about a week in advance which day you will visit
us and when you expect to arrive, We will then arrange to have
someone here to meet you and try to see that you talk to various
people about the problems in which you are interested.

Sincerely yours,

Philip M, Morse
Director
