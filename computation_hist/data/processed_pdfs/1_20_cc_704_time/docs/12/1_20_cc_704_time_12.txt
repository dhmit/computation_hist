Dear Dr, Hunter:

In accordance with our discussions, this letter is intended
as a formal request for 40 hours of 704 testing time which is to be
used in connection with our 704 program in the M.I.T, Computation Center,

It is my understanding that there may be time available for
this purpose either at Poughkeepsie or the New York 704, I would
appreciate your checking the availability of machine time and setting
up a schedule which may be used for the testing of programs which we have
prepared for the Computation Center, I beliwe the schedule of machine time
should be set up in blocks of one hour intervals in order to obtain maximum
utilization of machine time, or whatever other procedure has proven to be
most efficient in light of experience in testing programs,

 

We would appreciate receiving a schedule of the testing time
as soon as possible in order that we may begin to check out some of our
post mortem and utility programs,

Sincerely yours,

F. M, Verzuh
Assistant Director
Computation Center
