Dear Professor Morse:

| was very much pleased to have a part in the dedication
last Thursday, and be your guest af lunch.

 

As we discussed while walking back, certainly the new
horizons which you are opening for your students will redound not only
to their personal advancement, but also to the greater strength of our
country.

 

We prize our relationship with M.1.T., and surely hope
that it will continue to be satisfactory from your standpoint .

Sincerely,

‘ 71 C Fo
