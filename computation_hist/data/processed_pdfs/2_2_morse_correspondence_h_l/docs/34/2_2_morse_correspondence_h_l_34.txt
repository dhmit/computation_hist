Whirlwind I, an electronic digital computer at M.L.T., has been used to calculate accurately the optical
and electrical constants of thin metal films on nonabsorbing backings and of aluminum oxide films, and to
check approximate relations which may be conveniently used in the absence of a digital computer. The
conductance per square of film is found to be the principal physical property determining the behavior of
conducting films toward incident infrared radiation. The variation with wavelength is related to the finite
relaxation time of the free electrons and to imperfections in the films acting as condensers. In the visible
wavelength region the two sets of optical constants were evaluated for different thicknesses of gold deposits
and compared to optical constants previously reported.

To find the fundamental quantities ucoa and (e/ €0)
from Egs. (7) and (8), it is necessary to solve Eqs. (1),
(2), (4), (5) and (6) [or Egs. (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6)]
for n and % in terms of the experimental data for R (or
R'), T, m, a, and \. It is clear from the form of these
equations that no explicit function can be found for un
and k. Therefore, a series of successive approximations
must be made, trying a set of # and k, and computing
R (or R') and T corresponding to this set of # and p.
The time required for each computation of R (or R)
and 7), on a desk calculator, from a set of # and is
about 13 hours; ten approximations may be necessary
to achieve the required accuracy. Therefore, about 15
hours per sample per wavelength are required by desk
calculator. If the radiation incidence on both metal film
and backing are to be considered, this number may be
doubled.

When the thickness of the metal film decreases, the
reflectance and transmission become less sensitive to
the properties of the metal, and the index of the backing
becomes relatively more important, Therefore, the
accuracy afforded in » and k by experimental accuracy
decreases with decreasing film thickness, so that the

partial derivatives dn/dR, dn/dT, dk/dR, and dk/aT
should be reported along with the computed » and 2 in
order that the probable error may be estimated in 5
and % corresponding to the probable error in the re-
flectance and transmission data. Uncertainty regarding
the density of the film also indicates the desirability
of repeating the calculation for various film thicknesses,
so that the need for a faster calculating medium is
clearly indicated. Graphical approximations have been
used by Murmann,® but even the use of these is very
laborious, and their accuracy decreases considerably
when the metal film thickness decreases.

Since 7 and % [and hence ucoa and (e/e)] depend
on four independent variables, R, T, (a/)), and n;, the
publication of tables with sufficiently small increments
is not practical for accurate evaluation of # and &.

For the above reasons, a program was coded for
WWI, an electronic digital computer at M.LT., as
described below. This program is designed to take data
in a form which can be supplied by anyone not ac-
quainted with electronic computers, and it produces
and labels the results in a convenient way for direct
use or publication. The techniques developed for
Whirlwind I will be described in a future publication.
For direct calculation of the optical and electrical
constants a program has been developed to find these
constants as functions of the reflectances and trans-
mission, film thickness, wavelength of incident radia-
tion, and index of refraction of a backing, if present.
Another program has been developed to compute the
reflectance and transmission as functions of the optical

constants, film thickness, wavelength of incident radia-

tion, and the index of refraction of a backing if present.
The latter program is used to test an estimated set of
optical constants; if the computed pair of reflectance
and transmission agrees with an observed pair, then
the estimated set of optical constants is indeed a correct
set of constants of the film.

II. APPROXIMATIONS IN THE INFRARED

A. Electrical Constants

Many backings, such as cellulose nitrate, transmit
nearly one hundred percent of infrared radiation. When

plied Mathematics. ournal of the Society for Industrial and Ap

March 1955

such backings are used, the calculations can be simpli-
fied by setting n; equal to unity. In the infrared a/A<1,
so in Eqs. (4), (5), and (6) the following approximations?
can be made:

cos{ (2mra/\) (n+ik)}=21—5{2ra/\) (n+ik))?,
sin{ (2ra/\) (n+ik)}=(2xa/\) (n+ik).
These lead to the approximate equations:
A/T= (wa/\)*(ucoa)®*+ {14-2(xa/N\) ucoa, (9)
where 4 =absorptance by the film

R/T= (ma/N*(¢/ &0) — 1}*+ (3ucoa)®. (10)

Woltersdorff® has derived similar equations. It follows
from Eq. (10) that (R/7T)> (3ucea)?. Equation (9) can
be more crudely approximated by the relation ucoa
~ (A/T). This leads to a lower limit to R given by:

RL (1—R-T7)* (47). (11)

Thus R and T" are not entirely independent, but are
limited by the inequality in Eq. (11). This equation
has proven useful for a quality control of such measure-
ments on transparent films.

According to Eq. (9) the absorption per unit trans-
mission depends on the conductance but not on the
dielectric constant of the film. In Eq. (10) the con-
tribution of the dielectric constant to the reflectance
per unit transmission depends on the ratio of film thick-
ness to radiation wavelength. For a thin conducting
film in the infrared this contribution is very small com-
pared with that due to the conductance. Therefore the
contribution of the dielectric constant to the reflectance
and transmission of thin, conducting films in the infra-
red is minor. It follows that the dielectric constant
cannot be accurately determined by infrared optical
measurements, and that the conductance is the prin-
cipal physical property of the film determining its
optical behavior in the infrared. A crude fit of electrical
constants to a set of reflectance and transmission
measurements can be obtained by varying the con-
ductance alone. A fine adjustment can be made by
varying the dielectric constant.

Equations (9) and (10) are both quadratics. Since
conductance is always positive, only one root of Eq. (9)
is physically significant. Equation (10) has two solu-
tions for the dielectric constant, either of which may be
physically significant. According to Lorentz® and Zener?
the dielectric constant (e/e) and polarizability « for a
system of free electrons are related to frequency » of
the incident radiation, concentration »,, mass m, charge
(—e), and relaxation time 7 of the free electrons by the
expression

The polarizability of free electrons is seen to be
negative. When 7 and/or 7 are sufficiently large, the
dielectric constant becomes negative also. Therefore, in
the region of free electron absorption the physically
significant solution of Eq. (9) is the one in which the
dielectric constant is less than unity, and may be
negative. The behavior of bound electrons will be dis-
cussed in Secs. IV and V.

B. Optical Constants

Equations (7) and (8) can be solved for the optical
constants, to give

nt=3(¢/ eo) +{(3¢/ 0)’ +[ (ucaa)/ (4ma/N) J}, (13)

and

k= —3(¢/€) +{(3¢/ €)*+[ (ucoa)/ (4ma/N) J}. (14)

These forms are the most convenient to use with auto-
matic computing devices. If (3¢/¢) is factored out, as is
frequently done, and (3¢/€)? is taken out of the square
root, either the positive or the negative root must be
taken, depending on the sign of ¢, in order to make »
and k real. While a person has no trouble selecting the
appropriate root, such discrimination has to be pro-
grammed for an automatic computer.

When a first estimate of the electrical constants has
been found by solving Eqs. (9) and (10), these esti-
mates are substituted into Eqs. (13) and (14) for a
first estimate of the optical constants. For very good
conductors the assumption (ucoa)/(2ra/N)>(e/€)? is
often made. This leads to the approximate expression

2k’ (ucoa)/ (4ra/\) = pcol/ 4. (15)

It will be shown below that this approximation is not
necessarily valid for thin films. Yet it should be noted
that the approximate, and invalid, expression given by
Eq. (15) leads to the correct product of the optical
constants, namely

nk= (ucoa)/ (4ra/\),

which is equivalent to the exact equation (8). The
dielectric constant, on the other hand, would always be
zero if » is made equal to k. Since this is incorrect,
Eq. (15) gives the wrong dielectric constant and optical
constants but happens to correspond to the correct
conductance. It has been shown in Sec. II-A that the
conductance is the principal physical property deter-
mining the optical behavior in the infrared. Therefore
a whole family of optical constants obeying the condi-
tion nk=constant would roughly fit the observed
infrared reflectance and transmission, but fine adjust-
ment by means of the dielectric constant would be
necessary to calculate the individual optical constants.

served sets of reflectance and transmission. The values
thus found were used to estimate the optical constants
according to Egs. (13) and (14), which in turn were
substituted into Egs. (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6) to
compute the reflectance and transmission. As indicated
in the introduction, the difference between the observed
and calculated set of reflectance and transmission is a
test of the validity of the approximation. In Table I are
listed four examples of results obtained with the Whirl-
wind I test program. It happens that for this test run
only the root ¢/eo>1 of Eq. (10) was taken. Since the
experimental error in Woltersdorff’s data is at least
0.005, Eqs. (9) and (10) are very suitable for the
evaluation of his and similar data.

Since there are two dielectric constants fitting each
set of reflectance and transmission measurements, there
are two sets of optical constants as well. This is demon-
strated in Table IV, which lists the results for data
reported by Woltersdorff.® These results will be dis-
cussed in Sec. III. It is appropriate to this section on
numerical analysis to point out a relationship between
the two sets of solutions. If Egs. (9) and (10) were to
hold exactly, the two sets of solutions would have the
same conductance, and would have dielectric constants
with the same absolute value of {(e/e—1)}, but
opposite sign. If the two sets are labeled with respective
subscripts “1” and “2,” (ucoa)1= (ucoa), and {(e/e)
—1}={1—(e2/e)}. From Eqs. (7) and (8) it follows
that nik1=n.k, and n24n.*— 1 =k2+k2+1. The re-
sults shown in Table TV were calculated exactly, using
Eqs. (1) through (8). Where the ratio of film thickness
to wavelength is sufficiently small, as for instance for
sample Sb 4 and sample Al 19, the relations between the
two solutions derived from the approximate Eqs. (9)
and (10) are obeyed fairly well, but for thicker films,
such as Bi 12, there is a noticeable deviation.

The approximation n=#%, which is based on the
assumption {(ucoa)/(2ra/N)}2>(¢/€)?, has also been

tested on Whirlwind I. Results of this test are shown in
Table II, in which the set of approximate results, labeled
n' and %/, is listed together with both sets of accurately
computed results. “Accurately computed” results are
results corresponding to a set of reflectance and trans-
mission differing from the observed values by no more
than the expected experimental error.

While for massive conductors n=~% at these wave-
lengths, the results of the accurate calculations show
that for thin films # and k are very different. As pre-
dicted, the product nk is nearly the same for the accu-
rately and “approximately” computed sets of constants.
The accurately calculated results show that the assump-
tion that led to the expression #=2k is not valid for these
films. To demonstrate this the quantities {ucoa/
(2ra/\)} and (e/e) are listed in Table III as found
accurately on Whirlwind I for the samples given in
Table II. It is seen that only for Al 12 at 32.8u is the
inequality {ucoa/(2ma/))}>>(e/€)? valid. This is also
the only one for which, according to Table II, n~k.

The values of AR and AT in Table IT, used to indicate
the accuracy of the approximation n==2, seem to show
that the approximation is not too bad here. In Sec.
IT-B it was predicted that a whole family of optical
constants obeying the condition nk= const. would give
a reasonable fit. The three pairs of constants given for
each sample and each wavelength in Table II form
such a family. Two of the three pairs, namely (nk)
and (nak) fit the observed data exactly, while the
third, namely (»’,k’), fits the data moderately well but
by no means exactly. The values of AR and AT given in
Table II show that varying » and % subject to the
condition nk= constant does not greatly alter R and 7.
The conclusion from these data is that the individual
optical constants of thin films do not equal each other,
and that they cannot be determined with as great
accuracy as can their product nk. This conclusion is in
agreement with the one drawn in Sec. II-B from an
analysis of the influence of the dielectric constant on
the optical behavior of thin films in the infrared. In
summary, then, it is proposed that the infrared proper-
ties of thin films are better described by their electrical
than by their optical constants. Of the former, the con-
ductance per square is very significant and accurately
determinable. Since the optical constants are functions
of both electrical constants, the uncertainty regarding

the dielectric constant is reflected in both optical con-
stants as is clearly shown in Table II.

In conclusion, attention should be drawn to the
derivatives of the optical constants with respect to the
reflectance and transmission listed in Table IV. These
derivatives relate the expected inaccuracies in the
calculated optical constants to the probable experi-
mental errors in reflectance and transmission. For the
infrared measurements listed here these derivatives are
very large indicating that the accuracy in determining
the individual optical constants is not very great. The
derivatives of the conductivity and dielectric constants
can be found by differentiating Eqs. (7) and (8):

The factor 4ra/\ in Eq. (17) causes the derivatives of
ucaa to be small. The derivatives of the dielectric con-
stant are large when the derivatives of the optical con-
stants are. This once more demonstrates that the con-
ductance per square can be determined with greater
accuracy in the infrared than can the dielectric and
optical constants. This is in agreement with the con-
clusions of the preceeding paragraph.

III. THE VARIATION OF CONDUCTIVITY WITH
WAVELENGTH IN THE INFRARED: AN
ANALYSIS OF WOLTERSDORFEF’S
RESULTS

Harris and Loeb? have shown that there are at least
two causes of the variation of conductance with wave-
length in thin metal films. These are the “condenser
effect” and the “relaxation effect.” The condenser
effect is due to nonconducting regions or ‘‘scratches”
which can intercept electric current. Such imperfections
act as condensers that have an infinite impedance
toward direct currents, but whose impedance decreases
with increasing frequency. Thus the effective conduc-
tance in the infrared tends to decrease with increasing
wavelength if there are imperfections acting as con-
densers. The relaxation effect causes the induced elec-
tron motion to lag behind an imposed radiation field,
so that the amount of energy absorbed is less than it
would be if the field and the current were in phase.
This lag increases with increasing frequency. Therefore
the effective conductance increases with increasing
wavelength in the infrared. This variation is given® by
the equa‘ion

(ucogott/ ncaa) = 14+7*(2mwc/\)?, (18)

where og. is the direct current conductivity.

Both effects are thought to be responsible for the
“anomalies” in the film conductances reported by
Woltersdorfi.® All of Woltersdorff’s complete data (in-

Whirlwind I. Of these some did not satisfy inequality
(11). The results for the rest are presented in Table IV.

Figure 1 shows plots of the reduced resistance per
square of film, 1/ucoa, plotted versus (¢/\)? for the bis-
muth samples. The results are consistent with Eq. (18),
and the dc resistivity and relaxation time have been
computed for each bismuth sample from the slopes and
intercepts of the lines in Fig. 1. The results are listed
in Table V. The values found for r are but slightly less
than corresponding values for massive metals, for which

When R and T are plotted against A, as was done by
Woltersdorff, curves exhibing maxima and minima are
obtained, in contrast to the straight line obtained when
ucaa is plotted against (¢/AN). It appears that Wolters-
dorff’s anomaly of poor conductors is actually the
relaxation effect. The calculation of pg* was made
with the assumption that uc=puec=377 ohms, where pu,
is the permeability of vacuum. Since bismuth is dia-
magnetic 4 may be less than uo. A lower assumed value
of 4 would give rise to a lower value of p4* and thus to
better agreement between pg.* and p** than that given
in Table V.

The films of the good conductors, Al and Ag, do not
behave as do the Bi films. As can be seen from Table IV,
they do not show an increasing conductivity with in-
creasing wavelength. The Al and Ag films divide into
two classes: samples Al 12, Al 9, and Ag 1 have constant

 

conductances, while the conductances of samples Al 19,
Ag 9, and Ag 7 decrease with increasing wavelength.
In the former class the relaxation model may still
apply, with a relaxation time 7 less than the value

been made with radiation incident on the metal film
as well as with radiation incident on the backing, and the
computations were timed separately for both cases.
The first estimates listed are those for film incidence;
the final values obtained for film incidence are always
used as first estimates for the calculation for backing
incidence.

Provisions have been made for two methods of
obtaining first estimates. When actual values are
available, either from previous publications or from
tables for solid metals, these can be inserted into
Whirlwind I, which then proceeds to make successive
approximations. When no such values are available,
Egs. (9) and (10) together with Egs. (13) and (14)
are used by Whirlwind I to obtain first estimates and
to make successive approximations automatically with-
out external interference. As has been pointed out,
Egs. (9) and (10) are not valid in the visible wavelength
region, but they provide adequate first estimates to
start a series of successive approximations leading to
values of the optical constants within experimental
precision. Many data have been evaluated on Whirl-
wind I, and the results for samples prepared here are
scheduled for future publication. Table VII is a sample,
for A=7000A, of results obtained by Whirlwind I, cor-
responding to reflectances and transmissions measured
by Krautkraemer.'® The results of Krautkraemer’s own
calculations are also included. It is at once noted that,
while Krautkraemer reported one pair of constants per
sample per wavelength, there are four such pairs calcu-
lated by Whirlwind I for each sample and wavelength.

0 J, Krautkraemer, Ann. Physik 32, 537 (1938).

There are two reasons for this. In the first place Kraut-
kraemer either discarded the measurements made with
backing incidence or, in some instances, used an ap-
proximation utilizing both film and backing incidence.
This approximation is based on an assumption that the
optical constants are the same for film as for backing
incidence. The results produced by Whirlwind I were
calculated for film and backing incidence independently,
as shown in the lines marked “f”” and “‘d,” respectively.
From these results it can be seen that the constants
obtained from film incidence are not necessarily iden-
tical with those obtained from backing incidence. There
may be several reasons for this discrepancy. In the first
place the measurements themselves may be at fault,
particularly for the very thinnest films, which have
low reflectances. In the second place there may be a
difference in properties of the metal at the air and at
the backing surface of the film. Since the reflectance
depends more strongly on the condition of the film
nearest the surface of incidence, a difference between
the two surfaces would manifest itself in the constants
calculated from film and backing incidence. The second
reason for the multiplicity of the results produced by
Whirlwind TI is that a complete double-valued solution
was obtained, as indicated by subscripts “1” and “2.”
When Krautkraemer’s results are compared with those
produced by Whirlwind I, it is seen that his results for
deposits thicker than 24A agree quite well with the
results having subscript “2,” for which na < kg, and
that for the thinner deposits Krautkraemer’s results are
in agreement with the results with subscript “1” for
which 71> ki. According to Krautkraemer’s results the
curve n vs thickness crosses the curve k vs thickness.


188

This is not the case for either solution obtained with
Whirlwind I. When the curves cross each other, the
expression {(e/e)—1} changes its sign, and (vo’—?)
in Eq. (20) then also changes sign. This would indicate
a shift in the center of the absorption band, vo, with
thickness. Krautkraemer observed such a shift for gold
deposits thinner than 72A. He chose the set (1,ks) for
the thicker deposits because those values resembled the
values of the massive metal. His choice of the set
(11,k2) for the thinner films was based on the fact that
values of R and T calculated with the aid of the Garnett
theory," using reasonable assumptions, gave good
agreement with his measured values of R and 7.

At zero deposit thickness the optical constants be-
come indeterminate; the derivates of » and k with re-
spect to R and T calculated by Whirlwind I do increase
with decreasing thickness, thus demonstrating this
indeterminacy.

SUMMARY

A program has been developed for Whirlwind I, an
electronic digital computer at M.I.T., to calculate the
optical and electrical constants of thin metal films on
nonabsorbing thick backings, as functions of observed
reflectances and transmissions. With this program two
sets of optical and electrical constants have been com-
puted for numerous films.

Approximate equations have been developed for the
infrared to obtain the optical and electrical constants
conveniently. The conductance per square of a metal
film is the most important physical property deter-
mining the optical behavior of such a film. The optical

constants of such thin films do not equal each other in
the infrared. The conductance of bismuth films was ob-
served to increase with increasing wavelength. This
observed variation was shown to be consistent with that
computed on the basis of an electronic relaxation time
r~10~1 sec, which is somewhat smaller than that ob-
served for massive metals. Films of silver and aluminum
were observed to split into two classes. One class con-
tains films of low dc conductivity: these films displayed
a decrease in conductivity with an increase in wave-
length. This behavior is thought to be due to condenser-
like imperfections. The other class consisted of films of
high dc conductivity, with no appreciable change in con-
ductivity with change in wavelength. These films dis-
played no condenser effect, and no observable relaxation
effect. This means that their 7 is less than 107" sec.
The product of relaxation time 7 and electron con-
centration 7, can be found from dc measurements.
When the relaxation time is found from optical measure-
ments, the electron concentration can be calculated.
For bismuth this was found to be ~10* cm™. For the
aluminum and silver films of the second class the prod-
uct n.r was at least an order of magnitude larger than
that of bismuth films. Since the infrared measurements
indicate that 7 for the good conductor films is less than
that of the poor conductor films, the measurements
show that 7, is about one hundred times as great for
the good conductors as for bismuth.
