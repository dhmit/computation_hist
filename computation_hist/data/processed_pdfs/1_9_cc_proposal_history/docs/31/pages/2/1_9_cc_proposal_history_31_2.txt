although their connection with particular machines is discussed
in the body of the feport.

In Table I it will be seen that machines are typed as to
whether thej are digital or analog and a word should be said
about this classification. The digital machines acﬁually
carry out the numerical operations such as addition and mul®€i-
plication by counting. An example of such a machine would be

the ordinary desk-size calculator. The analog devices, on the

‘other hand, measure rather than count. A phyéical device such

as8 a mechanical or electrical system 1s used to reprasent the
problem, with variables being represented by lengths, voltages,
etc. A simple example of such a device is a slide rule. It
may be mentioned that the digital type 1s in principie more
precise, since the upper limit of its precision is determined by
the number of digits it can handle. The precision of analog
devices, however, is limited in principle by the precision of
its fabricated parts.

Table I includes the name of the department in which the
particular machine is used. The listing may also be used to
find where in the body of the report a fuller discussion of
the machine will be found. In connection with the department,
there is listed the name of the person to be seen about the use
of the particular machine.

Of the analog devices contalned in Table I, five of
them are what may be called large-scale machines. These are,
consequently, of somewhat greater interest and in Table II

will be found a concise synopsis of the capabilities of these
