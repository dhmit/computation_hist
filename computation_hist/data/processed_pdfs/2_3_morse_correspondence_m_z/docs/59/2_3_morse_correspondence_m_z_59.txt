In accordance with our conversation: with the following 0N3
representatives , -

Dr. F. Joachim Wayl, Director 01 Math Sciences Division,
Washington, D. c.

Dr. Arthur Grad

Dr. Carl F. lukenhsupt, Chief Scientist, ONE, Boston

we recommend that you apply to cm: for an extension of the existing
contract (Project 6345) without additional funds for the fiscal period
1957-58.

 

Because 0! the delay in the completion of the new

Karl T. Compton Laboratory, it will be impossible to install the
1m Type 704 Electronic Data Processing Machine at ILLT. on march 1
as we originally scheduled. As a result, it will be impossible for us

' to release our use of the Whirlwind Computer on June 30, 195? as
originally scheduled. It is very important that we have adequate time
to install the 704 and make the necessary conversion of programs from
Whirlwind to the 704 language. This means that there will be some period
of time during which dual operation of both the 704 and Whirlwind Computers
is in effect. It is difficult to determine in advance the exact termina-
tion data of our use of the Whirlwind facility. However, as we discussed
at our‘meting, we shall notify you of the termination date as soon as

this information becomes available.

. Extending the present contract without additional funds for the
above—requested 12—month period will permit us to effect a. smooth
trasition from the Whirlwind machine to the 704; furthermore, it will
provide: us with the necossm‘y time to prepare the final summary report

for this contract.

  

Since we are: not requesting any additional funds for this
extEmsioxa, we have not prepared the usual estimated budget requirements.
This is, 03! co" in accordance with our discussion: at our meeting

on Thursday, “

   

 

3.50, in accord with these discussions, so are currently preparing
a proposal to he sulﬁittcd to own for n specific msearch program, which
would be set up as a separate project within the new BIT Comp-station Center,
designed to make moms effective use of the Type 10: machine. This ‘
proposal will include research item‘of a mathematical nature

as we discussed with Weyl. A separate request for man
