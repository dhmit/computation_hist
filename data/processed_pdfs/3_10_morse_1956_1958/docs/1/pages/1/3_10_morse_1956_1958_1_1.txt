In accordance with our discussions regarding ways and means
for financing the M.I.T. Computation Center involving the
704 operation, I have prepared a four-page summary of "purchased"
time on the WW1l Computer broken down on a project basis.

It should be mentioned that the charge for the use of this
computer falls into a number of categories:

i. Guarsnteed time charged at an eguivalent rate of
$3.205/hour of WWi time.

2. Regular charge at a rate of $4.167/hour of WW1l time,

Tom Crane, Research Fiscal Officer, and I will meet to discuss
a possible revision of the current billing procedure.

During this six-month pericd the "purchased time" usage of
WW1i breaks down as follovws:

Aero-elastic Allocation Account 1028.1 @ 3,295.05
Servomechanisms Account 1065.2 3,413.96
Civil Engineering 480.0 1,538.40
Instrumentation Allocation Account 1500.0 4,807.50
leteorology Department 843.0 2,701 .82
Geology Department 833.1 2,670.08
Buerger | 287 .4 921.13
Research Laboratory of Electronics 1080.0 4,500.37
Misc. non-guaranteed billings : 1209.3 2,039.19

GRAND TOTAL 8326.1 $28,887.50

The attached four~page summary provides a detziled bregkdown
of the individual projects and sponsors involved. I think it is a
simple matter to be able to determine which laboratory should
contribute how much for the 704 operation. I am looking forward to
discussing this matter at our next meeting on Tuesday, February 14.
