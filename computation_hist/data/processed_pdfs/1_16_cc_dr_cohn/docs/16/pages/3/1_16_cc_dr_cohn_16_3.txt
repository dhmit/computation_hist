This result is due to Minkowski [4, p. 189]; we therefore simply
note some special aspects of the lemma which tie in with familiar
results. In case there are more than d vectors (and their negatives)
on the surface, let us choose (00") so as to produce a minimal positive
determinant. Then for d=2 the basis can always be chosen as
(of, mg) itself, while {or d=3 it can be chosen as (out, mg, mg) or
(once; (wf+w;+w;)/2), as was known to Minkowski [3, p. 101]. If
K is specialized to an ellipsoid, then for d§3 only the basis (wt)
will occur.

3. Reduction to ﬁniteness. In the search for critical lattices, we
ﬁrst restrict the K-admissible lattices to the subclass having 4 inde
pendent vectors on the surface of K. This is no restriction since every
Kladmissible lattice can be contracted to a K—admissible lattice with
the further property. We then let (01f) be such a set of d independent
vectors. By the ﬁnite bases lemma, the lattice has as its basis a set
(9;) chosen from among the ﬁnite collection in (2).

Then the conditions (1), subsidiary to the minimizing of the de-
terminant of the 9“, can be rewritten as <I>( 21>; 9321, where (Pi)
are still all integral lattice points, not the origin and where equality
is achieved when the argument of (I) is one of the vectors to.

one for each basis, and they contain the origin and hence a hyper-
sphere of radius pa, depending on d alone. To be more speciﬁc, using
the estimates an - - - au<dl and my: loci for k>j (an easy conse-
quence of (2a)), we ﬁnd that for instance paid—”’(d!)-m. Hence
by the main theorem of the companion paper [1], I; will contain no
p.integral lattice points, other than the origin, in its interior if it
fails to contain those in a hypersphere of radius Cdpfi'FU.

Thus the system of inequalities (1) can now be replaced by the
ﬁnite collection of the ﬁnite systems (one system for each basis)

In principle, of course, we select the basis whose system gives the
smallest determinant; and in each system we would have had to
change some inequalities to equality and to ignore many more.

When d>3, however, there seems to be no easy way to determine a
minimal system.
