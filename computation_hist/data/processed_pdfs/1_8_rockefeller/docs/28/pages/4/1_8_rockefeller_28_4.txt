would take about three years to get rolling and the devel

stages of the utilization of electronic computers, when the prob-

lems are not too clearly formulated and when neither partner in

__ the team knows the others plans and ideas. Later, when some or

the more important potentialities have been demonstrated, the
research can be split up into projects, each with a definite goal
and with its own budget, which can include partial support for
the continuing staff of the Center. 3o, eventually, the Center

could be financed indirectly by contributions from each project

which uses it, if this were considered to be the most desirable

way of keeping it going. At present,

tions from established research proJects can only support about a

third of the $100,000 needed, which would leave unsupported the

most fruitful research of all, the unknown results which are sure

to come when a machine expert of the Center staff works together

with the economist, psychologist or sociologist, on the faculty

of one of our participating colleges who comes to the Center with
only a "gleam in his eye."

Possible Initial Directions for Investigation

As indicated, we cannot write down in any detail the

directions which this research effort will take, as the various

teams are formed and begin to interact. There are several general
