especially since part of what is available will probably be needed
for computations elsewhere. We do also have free computer time

at Wright Field which can be used for machine computations on other
types of integrals and for other computations necessary in our
molecular calculations, but unfortunately it is not practicable to
transfer the Whirlwind exchange integrals code there.

In brief, we would like to request for use between now and about
June 1, (l) confirmation of free time of about 10 hours which we
hope still remains from our previous allotment; the time so used
can be Justified, I believe, in terms of John Slater's interest

in perfecting the existing code and increasing its speed; (2) an
additional 60 hours, for which we can make a contribution up to

$7,660 or perhaps $8,000.

To the extent that you can accelerate your reply to our request
we shall be deeply grateful.

With best wishes for the New Year,

Sincerely,

WW

R. S. Mulliken
