to the transfer of the Differential Analyzer facilities to this labora-
tory and particularly to the transfer of the associated shop facilitie-
efiective July 1. 1950. . .

. _ Ila find no point of difference with your letter and. accept it
in it: entirety.

I believo you. havé talked with Paul 'Juoick relative to the
transfer of the inventory to the Instrumentation Laboratory. We have in—
formed Paul that this transfer is acceptable to no and have roqueu'sed his
advice to the and that the transfer can be effected in a manner acceptable
to the Government auditors. Howard Forbes, Purchasing Agent of this
laboratory, should be kept infomsd-of all action in this area.

Non-staff personnel in our laboratory are under the mporviaioz:
of Robert S. Tambly'n. I am referring your letter to Bob so that he can
take the action necessary to get Front. Fatwa anal Hinthor on our payroll
effective July 1. 1950.

The DIG number assigned to the Differential Analyzer is 6783.
The salaries of the three shop men and all further mteriala requimé by
the shop should be charged against this number. Thu same: number will, of
course. be charged with the inventory transfer already mentions?“ This
number will also carry tho salary of Fredric-5:301: anti the second Znatmmentan
