Dear Dr. Schader,

Mr. Blackburn, Educational Coordinator for I.B.M.
in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has suggested that I
communicate with you in regard to computation which IT
would like to do on the 704 machine at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.

I have a social science research project which is
a part of my doctoral program at Syracuse University.
All of my other work for the degree has been completed
and I am now located in Worcester, Massachusetts,
teaching at a college in the vicinlty.

My data have been coded and punched on 622 I.B.M.
cards. While the number of cards is not great, the
number of variables contained in the data seems to
indicate that use of one of the larger machines will
be necessary. IL had hoped to make use of a 650 machine,
but 1t now appears that this is not feasible.

My problem seems to lie in how I may qualify for
use of the 704 machine at M.I.Te As I understand it,
computation time is to be divided among M.I.T., the
members of an association of other New England colleges,
and 1.B.,M, Neither Syracuse University nor the college
in which I am presently teaching are members of the
associations There 1s a possibility that I might be
able to work through one of the association members,
Northeastern University, since I am a former faculty
member of that institution. However, I wonder if it
would be possible to work more directly through I.B.M.,
or, if people from Syracuse University might receive
authorization to utilize the computation service at
M.I.T.

I shall be greatly appreciative if you will advise
me concerning the proceedure I should follow,

Sincerely,

A
