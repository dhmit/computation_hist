~ The tluth value T can be‘used to S1mplify
certain conditional forms, Thus, instead of

Xl = (x<0 —--x,x70 —x)
we shall write

The propositional connectives can be defined
by conditional forms as follows,

pAq —q,T — F)

PvVq:=(p —*T,T =+q)

AP = (p —+F,T'—>T)

pcq = (p—q, T —T)

Considerations . of truth tables shows that these

formulas give the same results as the usual defi-
nitions, However, in order to treat partial
functions we must consider the possibility that

P or q may be undefined,

Suppose that p is false and q is un-
defined; then according to the conditional form
definition pAq 1is false and qAp is un-
defined, This unsymmetry in the propositional

connectives turns out to be appropriate in the
theory of computation since if a calculation of

P gives F as a result q need not be computed
to evaluate pAq, but if the calculation of p
does not terminate, we never get around to com-
puting p.

Definition of Functions by Recursion, The
definition
ni = (H:O -*l,T —*n-(n—l):)
is an example of definition by recursion, Con-
sider the computation of 0!
(0=0 —1,T —0+(0-1)"')
We now see that it is important to provide that
the conditional form is defined even if a term
beyond the one that gives the value is undefined,
In this case (0-1)! is undefined,
Note also that if we consider a wider
domain than the non-negative 1ntevers nd -as

with the“Space U,

“defined above becomes a partial functlon since

unless n 1is a non-negative integer, the
recursion process does not terminate.

In general, we can either define single
functions by recursion or define several func-
tions together by simultaneous recursion, the
former being a particular case of the latter
