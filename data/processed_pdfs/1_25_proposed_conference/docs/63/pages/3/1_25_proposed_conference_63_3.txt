9, 80 that there probabl
gmugrbe 'getween 40 and 50 attending. The attendange woulg be
aﬁ% fan probably more representative, of course, if all or
pa th: the travel expenses of the conferees could’ be financed.
> 8 confercnee were to get out a report which ecould be used
y the various directors, present ang brospective, and would be
avallable to NSF if so desired, then the editing, preparing and
publication of thig report would need to be financed. My letter
at present is just to sce if NSF is likely to be interested in
such a eonference, if they would be willing to finance some part
of 1t and, if so, what we jshould do about it next. I will be
away in Europe during August and the first part of September so
I vill not be on hand at the meeting mentioned in the enclosed
notice. If you have questions which should be brought up to
this meeting, I suggest you send them to Professor Frelberger.
In any case, I wlll be back by Septcmber 10 and would be glad to
hear your comments then or before I leave on August 5. I think
it is about time that this growing field of university computexr
research, education and service be discussed in temms of its
broader implications and necessitles. I hope you agree,

Yours,
