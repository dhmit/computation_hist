The annual cost indicated for each category in Table I is based on
the actual annual salary but does not include DIC overhead charges. As a
matter of fact, it must be emphasized that these salary costs are approxi-
mations rather tham actuazl rates (except for RDA and Statistical Services).
These approximations are due (in part) to the fact that certain project
leaders were reluctant to release actual salaries; in other cases it was
impossible to determine the exact cost because of fluctuations and part-time
assignzents of the participating persomnnel. Some of the larger projects
were not able to clearly define their operating costs.

Agglication and Utilization gg_ggggutera

The preceding discussion reveals that the operation of a computing
facility is expensive -- particularly if the installation is large. The
following questions naturally arise: :

1. What is the load factor on each facility?

3. VWhat is the distribution of the work load -- academic use,
administrative use, DIC research, military application, etc?

3. How are the costs allogcated to the user?

4. What i3 the replacement cost for sach facility?

Table II contains a breakdown of computer utnizatioi. cost allocation and
replacement expense. Inspection of this table will reveal that many approxi-
mations have, of necessity, been made.

The following sections contain additional information which is
pertinent to a particular facility.

Aeronautics and Transonic Alrcraft Control Groug

This computing facility is actuslly & combined computer consisting
of Philbrick computing equipment originally purchased by Prof. W. McEay (for
educational use in the Aeronautics Dept.) and the more-recently purchased
equipment obtained by the Tramsonic Aircraft Control Project (TAC) headed by
Mr. Tom Parsons. The equipment is utilized by both groups and maintained by
the TAC group. The replacement value of the facility is approximately $30,000,
and the operating budget is zlso $30,000.

Dynemic Analysis Contrd Laboratory (DACL)

The operational statistics for DACL were obtained from Dr. W. Seifert.
These data represent the activities of the Systems Analysis Group which con-
stitutes 50% of DACL. Again, the exact distribution and cleavage of operating
personnel presents some uncertainty in the determination of the utilization
and cost allocation of the DACL computer. It is well to emphasize that the
annual s√©laries for each type of individual do not include the usual DIC
overhead charge. If the overhead charges are included (since they actually do
exist), the annual budget for the Systems Analysis Group is approximately $550,000.
