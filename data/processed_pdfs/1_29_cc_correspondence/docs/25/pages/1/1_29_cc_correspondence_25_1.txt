Quarterly Progress Report

and

Computer Time Request

Dear Sir:

As a user of the Computation Center's facilities, you are asked to file
a progress report with the Center each quarter. The attached form is meant
to simplify this task and channel your efforts.

Much of the information requested here is reported in the Center's
Semi-Annual Report. This report will summarize and classify this data for
the benefit of present and future users and the sponsors of the Center.

Some other purposes of this report are to:

1) serve as a request form for next quarter's computer time,

2) allow the Center to update its operating records,

3) gilve the Center a clearer picture of its user's interests and needs.

The completed form should be returned to:

Dr. F. J. Corbat&; Associate Director
Computation Center, Room 26-142
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Cambridge 39, Massachusetts

Since this information should appear in our eighth semi-annual report
which is due in January, 1961, a prompt return of this form would be appreciated.
