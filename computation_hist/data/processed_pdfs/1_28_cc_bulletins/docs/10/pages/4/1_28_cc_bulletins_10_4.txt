The 7090 -~ Things to Start Thinking About

Although the 7090 is, in most respects, compatible
with the 709, there are a few points you should
remember:

1, Tape Density - The Centerts 7090 willl have all
Mod IV 729 tape drives (the high-speed drivesy,
The normal mode for these drives wlll be high-
density. Tapes that you have now are low- -
density and, though we don't propose you re-
wrilte your tapes, you must be careful to note
