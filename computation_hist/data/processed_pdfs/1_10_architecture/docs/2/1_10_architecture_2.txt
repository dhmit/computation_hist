- Dear Mr, Kavanagh:

JET "5 As you know, 1 am concerned: with the installation of the x

1M 704 Calculator and EAM equipment in the MIT Computation Center, |
On earlier examination of the Drawings A23, ete, concerning this
area, I had the impression that we were acoustically treating the
walls in this area, However, as a result of recent discussions with
Mr, R, C. Collins, 3 am concerned about. the folloving points:

g 1) I understand the west wall of the 704 Room (by the

7a tape units) is to be a hard plaster finish, I feel strongly that

 

ve should place sound absorbing material on this vall-~as we have
done here at MIT on our last three EAM installations,

2) 1 have exanined the sample “sprayed sabastos” which
you recommend for the recessed ceiling in the 704 Room, This material
appears to be suitable from an acoustical standpoint; however, I am
very concerned about the facet that particles of asbestos will g
falling into the 704 Room causing malfunctioning of the magnetie tape
units, As you kmow, we have spent several humdred thousand dollars
putting in air conditioning and filter equipment for the 704, We
cannot therefore allow foreign materi al from the ceiling te cause

tape malfunctiening,

3) I now understand that there is to be no acoustical ma-
terial in the EAM area, and I again am cencerned singe in every ome
of our previeus and present EAM installations, we have found it mest
essential to have acoustical material on the walls,

I understand that there has been some discussion of the above
items, but at this time, I want to formally express my concern about |
the above 3 items, I would appreciate hearing from you as soon as possible,

Sincerely yours,

F,. M, Verzuh
