5 . In accordmce aith our discunion on 5 July, I have mde
= a.rrangements with Frank Verzuh and Dean Arden to turn over tothenall
- of the responsi’oilit:.es I have enjoyed in coénnection with the Scientific

e, and Bngineering Group at tb& lﬁgital Computer Laboratory. . , s

A Dr:. 'hrzuh, in an a.ttmt +0 eaordimte the digim ceuputa-
'tion faeilitiea at MIT, will take over the finameigl supervision of the
group.  This will iavolve not only the handling of the budget;, cost
controls, etc., bui also our accepiance of probleme from MIT sources
outside of our group, the provision of such services as tape prepara-

tion, computer operation; and problem consultation for outside pro- Y
grammers, the issuance af snitable repom, and. the "budgetary control S
- of pereonnel. -

Dean Arden will take over the technieal direetmn of the
numerical analysis and progrming research activities of the group.

e 00nseqmntly, he will be responsible for the technical supervision of

 

the gtaff. The size of the staff will be maintained at a sufficiently
high level so that some fraction of the staff time may be committed by
Verzuh for maintaining a satisfactory cmputins service.

| It 13 expected that some of the overlappmg responaibilities
nll become more clearly defined and be resolved within a short time.

With these adjustmente made, I feel that I will be @ble to
~resign my D.I.C. appointment on 1 September O30 -

— I would like to express my appreciatien :E‘or the opportunity
-of working with you and the other people here at MIT.

~ Sincerely,

Jack ﬂor‘oer
