Dear Professor Morse:

In accordance with our conference on May 6th,
I am enclosing two copies of each of the following reports:

1. Quarterly Progress Report, 2-28-53
2. Report S-10

3. Solution of Boundary Value Problems on
Automatic Computing Equipment

The above reports are those which you suggested
could be sent to Col. Haywood with your next letter re-
garding the new contract proposal.

By the way, in my rush the other day I forgot
to ask you whether McGraw-Hill has asked you to review my
book on Machine Computation. 11 took the liberty of giving
your name as a possible reviewer--I hope you don't mind.
I hope to have this book ready for publication next spring.

Sincerely yours,

Frad

F. M. Verzuh
