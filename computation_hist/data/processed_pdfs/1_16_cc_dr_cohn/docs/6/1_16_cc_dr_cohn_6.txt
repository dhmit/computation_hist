THE RIEMANN FUNCTION FOR aZu/axay + H(J; + y)u — 0

BY HAnvnv COHN

  
     

   

1. Introduction. Some interesting hyperbolic diﬁerc
represented in the form

(1) [flu/01‘ 6y + H(:c + y)u = 0.

An instance of (l) as the wave equation in space was ﬁrst considered by Euler
[5; 480—81]. Instances of this equation in the ﬁeld of diﬂ'erential geometry
(Laplace) are given in Darboux [3; 52], and instances in the ﬁeld of compressible
hydrodynamics were considered by Riemann [0; 173] for linear ﬂows and by A.
Steichen (see Ackarct [1; 317]) for plane ﬂows.

We shall concern ourselves entirely with the evaluation of the Riemann
function of (1), by means of which Riemann showed how to solve (1) for given
boundary conditions. The Riemann function, despite its crucial importance,

ntial equations can be

 
     
  
   
   
 
 
 
   
  
   
   
   
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
  
  
  
 

seems to have been found in closed form only in the special cases Htr) = ——A
and H(r) = —>\(X + 1)”), A constant. Moreover these cases are just those

  

solved by Riemann, who, in turn, l . even been anticipated to some extent by

Euler [4]! Undoubtedly, the l’icard iteration process and its existence proof

{or the Riemann function in general, drew attention away from the evaluation

of this function. Nevertheless, the fact that the Riemann function has been ‘
evaluated only for these two simple e es restricts the number of physical

situations to which equation (1) can co pond and still remain simple enough

to permit solution in closed form by use of a Riemann function.

It will therefore be our purpose, to consider the possibility of finding the
Riemann function for a greater variety of functions Htr). The methods will
be twofold First of all we shall use a specialized artifice to obtain the
Riemann function in closed form for a few types of Htr), namely [{(r) =
—>\(>\ + 1),,i2/sinh” n(r + v) (A, n, y constant), and some of its limiting cases,
11(7) = A exp nr, —~)\()\ + 1),)“, and —>\. Then we shall consider a certain
Fourier integral expression for the Riemann function of (I) with arbitrary HO).
This latter expr on is due to Riemann. who derived it in a heuristic manner:
We shall also indicate a rigorous proof of Riennmn's expr sion, since this long-
neglected expression is of potential importance with the further development of
analysis.

the Riemann function is a function or four variables, 13(1) y; xiv 1/), defined bv
the system
(a) 3113/61 6y = 'Iitl‘ + M

(2) (b) R = 1 when .T =_ 1" ory = y’,

We shall assume for convenience that H(r) is regular and real for 1- Yeah and
that x and y are real in all cases under consideration.

To prove the existence of R by iteration, we rewrite the system (2) as the

single equation
(3) ROE, y; I” 1/) = 1 — ff“ >RCL‘; ,y: §Tiy1/,)H(-T. + yr) (Ix, (1y,

where B(x, y) is the rectangle formed by the horizontal and vertical lines through
' (x, y) and (z’, 3/). By continual substitution of the right member into itself,
we obtain the formal iterated series

This series is seen to be convergent and to represent a solution to (3). Equation

(3), or system (2), also has a unique solution, or otherwise expressed, any solution

to the homogeneous form of (3), with the term I deleted, would vanish identi-

cally.
These statements are made because the iteration process will motivate the

rest of the paper.

3. More general illustration of a Riemann function. We saw that the
iterated series (4) for R begins with the terms 1 7 [V + where
U = ”5(an(1‘. + y.) do, dy, . Now I' obviously equals zero when 11 = I’
or y = y’. Thus since R is also a constant for these values of 1' or y, we might
try to see if the Riemann function has the form R(I'; I’, y’). Substituting this
new value of R into equation (25,) we find that the Riemann function actually
can be written in this form if and only if (al'far) (6F 61/)H" is expressible as
fill"; 1L", 1/). Then (2) becomes

(l7) If(0;x’,y’) = l.


RIEMANN FUNCTION 299

We observe that {5) is an ordinary differential equation of second order with
only one initial condition. This, however, is natural since (5a) has onlv one
solution regular at U = O. For if we were to expand both U and f(U; :hr’ 1/)
into powers of (l‘ L 1’) and (y — y’), we should ﬁnd that they each begin with
theterm (1 - J” (y - y’JH (1’ + y’), whenceﬂ U; 2’, y’) = U + aw, y’wz +

Thus at U : 0, equation (5a) has both characteristic exponents zero,
which implies that (5a) has a solution R, regular and equal to unity at (7 = 0
and a solution It; with a logarithmic singularity at (7 = 0. Thus (5) uniquely
determines a Riemann function R = R. (l’; a", y’)

Unfortunately only very few cases are covered by this artiﬁce. The condition
that the Jacobian of (BU/61') (BU/6105!" and I' with respect to .r and y vanish
can be regarded as an identity in I’ and y’ for any given a; and y This identity
in turn leads to an ordinary differential equation if we develop H into power
series about the point 7' = .c + y. Then the identity implies the vanishing of
an inﬁnite series in the variables .27’, y’ with coefﬁcients expressible in terms of
H(r) and its derivatives. Since the coefficients of such a series must vanish,
we obtain an ordinary differential equation for H(r), namely

d/(Ir[H"d”H/dr2 — 3/'2(dl'l'/Hdr)"’] : 0,
which has as its general solution
(6) H0) = no + 1>m/’sinm<z‘+ y)

where A, p, v are constants This is the value of H(r) for which we shall derive

a Riemann function via (5).
In obtaining the Riemann function corresponding to the value of H0) given

in (6), we ﬁnd that
I' = —>\()\ + I) log (1 + V),
where

sinh Mr — .1") sinh “(y — y’)

V = — ———,

In terms of 1' equation (5) becomes

f V(l - V)dzR,/«IV2 + (1 ~ 21’)illr‘/dl' + MA + 1)]? : 0

I? = l at V = 0,

and its solution, a hypcrgcomctric function, is the Riemann function corre-
sponding to H(r) in ((5)Y namely,

The form of ”(7‘) in ((i) is seen to have a few simpler limiting cases. First

and H (r) = —h respectively. . . .
In these special casesy we can perform the limiting process (of conﬂuence)

and ﬁnd that when H (r) = —7\ exp Mr, (7) becomes

4. Riemann‘s Fourier integral expression. Perhaps a more promising method
of ﬁnding Riemann functions is one mentioned by Riemann. By changing
the variables of (1) to r = 1' + y and s = r — y and separating the new variables,
Riemann solved a class of boundary value problems by means of a Fourier
superposition. On comparing this solution with the one that would have been
obtained by using the Riemann function, Riemann [6; 179—181] arrived at a
heuristic result which we now state in the following fonn:

If we let

(9) 12* = 1 [v exp ik(s — s')W(r,7-'; k) dk

whore ll"(r, r’; k) is deﬁned by the ordinary diﬂcrential equation

(le/dr2 + [Ir2 + H(r)]W = 0

U7 = 0, ({l'l’v/dr = l at 1‘ =1"

,

that, changing to [he-old variables, we ﬁnd R* satisﬁes the relation

(11) m = iisgntr - I’) + sgnw - y’>lR(I, 1 :1", 11’)-

Wo can express 11' in terms of well-known functions only in a few cases, for
instance where H(r) = —)\ or ~Mh + l)_'7‘3, In these cases W takes the values

where B, again, is the rectangle formed by the horizontal and vertical lines
through (I, y) and (x’, y’). We see that, by the, uniqueness theorem stated in
§2, (16) would imply (1]) when 1' 7‘ 1" imd y # 1/ while, (15) would take care:
of the remaining points (for which .r = 1'" or y = y’).

We ﬁrst establish (15) It refers to points where l r —- r’ l = l s M s’ l or
lYl = Z ‘X. l, to use the arguments of Q,” . Thus by (13), we see that
(15) will follow from this lemma:

1]“ y‘ Z Z l X. l, andzfn Z 1, l/II'H Q..H(X. , X2, , X,“ ; Y) vanishes

The proof of the lemma can he carried out by induction. since aQM/aX;
and aQM/BY can he expressed as the sum of two integrals of the, type (2,, with
new arguments satisfying the same inequality

Having established (15)7 we then establish the remainder of (11), namely
equation (16) Still regarding (x’, y’) as ﬁxed, we write (9) as

(17) R‘ — RT.‘ = w(:c, y; k) dk

With the aim 0f showing that, I: 6210/61" Gy div" is l3l'ecisely the term required
for (16), To this end, note

”(L y; k) : 1r"ll'(m";/c) MP “'13 — 5") ~ nil/i" sin 15(7‘ — 1") exp zk(s — s’)
and 6210/61 6y = BZw/Brg — 8210,33" : —H(r)llr"(r, Mk) exp i/c(s ~ .5"), Hence,

Since, by (15), the right memlier of (17) vanishes when :1‘ = .7," or y = 1/. Thus
we finally see that (113) holds, and our proof is complete.

, 0. Concluding remarks. We mentioned previously that Riemann’s Fourier
Integral expansmn is at present limited in usefulness because the integral can
be found in closed form only in a few eases such as when H(r) = —)x or

_)\()\ + 1) /r’. .In these cases, however, the Riemann function has been already
found by our artiﬁce and we could therefore regard (11) as the sourcerof identities
relating exponential functions, Bessel functions, and hypergeometric functions.

We might mention these identities in passing, since they do not appear in
standard treatises on Bessel functions. By a suitable change in variables, the
identity (11) yields, when H(T) = —)\,

invite such a direct approach.
