Dear Dr. Burke:

Since receiving your letter of November 9 we have
been considering various possibilities for you to come to MIT
for next year. The complication 1s that there are no spare
funde in theoretical physics for an additional assoclateshlp
for next year. There 1is, however, the possibility of a joint
appointment between the Computation Center and the Research
Laboratory of Electronics.

Professor Alllis heads the division of the Electronics
Laboratory which 18 concerned with gas discharge and with the
theory of electron-molecule collisions. The Computation Center,
of course, is concerned with the application of the IBM 704, at
present installed, ©oO problems in physics. 1t might be posslble
to offer you a split appointment, half in one of these flelds
and half in the other. The appointment might be for about $600
s month, the duties belng to spend approximately half of your
time in helping physicists program their problems for the machine
and the other half of your time working with Professor Allis in
the field of collision theory. Once you are here it 1s per-
fectly possible to arrange for participation 1n teaching courses.
Please note that this appolntment would pay you during your stay
here but would not contribute toward your travel from England
or back. You would have to arrange to finance your travel.

If you are interested in some such jolnt® appointment,
please write me as soon as possible, enclosing your curriculum
vitae and asking someone like Professor Massey to write me a
letter of recommendation. We consider these appolntments in
January, so it 1is important that you act promptly if you wish
to be considered.

Yours silncerely,

Philip M. Morse
Professor of Physics and
Director, Computation Center
