«orthuhile parts then active should each be supported,
s 'projects, by funds from various sources. Now that the
-~ities of machine use are known by faculty and students,
«er support of research using machines can perhaps be provided
. the strength of the importance of the research itself, rather
than because of 1its interest as a problem in machine coding. Some
of these research projects may be supported by industry, some may
still need support from ONR, but the support need not all come from
‘the Mathematles Division of ONR; the other divisioms, interested
in the researsh, should contribute their share. Consequently, no
additional funds will be requested for DIC 6915 at this time, Next
summer the situation will be re-assessed and a final decision as to
its future will then be made,

- Project 6345 - The situation with respect to DIC 6345,
the operation o wind I itself, is quite otherwise. This
eguipment is the only high-speed digital computer available at
present for general research at the Institute. Unless enough
funds are available to pay for maintenance, operation; programming
and scheduling, no research reguiring mashine cocmputation of this
sort will be possible at the Institute and the goal set by the
other part, project 6915, would be nullified. At present WW1l is
supported in part by Linecoln Laboratory and in part by ONR. The
time not used by Lincoln, which is used by workers in projest 6345
and in the general research and ecducationzl astivifies of the In-
stitute, i3 equivalent to about 40 hours a week, full ene-shift
cperation of the machine., The ¢os® not born by Lineoln hive bsen
trimmed to gbout F1G0,000 per year. 7The problem 18 how to provide
this amount during June 1955-June 1956 and how to provide the
larsa:tambunt to keep going later if Lincoln should withdraw its
support. -

: One possibility would be to charge each user proportionally. .
te his use of the waschine, irrespective of the nature of his work. '
This, of course, would have thegresult of disceouraging most thesis
research and general feculty use of the machine, thus nullifying

the resulvs of the &fforts of project 0915, which was set up, in

part, to stimulate this interest. Another possibility would be

to charge those users who could afford it (the sponsored projects)
enough to pay for the full §160,000 needed for the next fiscal

. year and to allow thesis and general educational research free time.

_ ., Costs to othexr ONR Projects - But this year somswhat more
than one half of the sponsore > non-Lincoln) work done on WWl
was done for various ONR projects carricd on at the Inetitute.
Quite a bit (3-5 hours & week) was done for the project on Solid
State Physies under Professor Slaterg much time is used by the
