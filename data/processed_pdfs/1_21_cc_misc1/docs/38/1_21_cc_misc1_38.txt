the construction, assembly, housing, operation or preliminary
testing of the Electronic Computer and Alveraft Analyser.”

(Restatement of Task Order I)

The work to be performed by the Contractor hereunder shall
consist of combined Phases I and II of four phases of Project
2hoXe3 (formerly Project RF-12) in accordance with 'Specifi-
cations for Project RE-12, known as WHIRLWIND, dated October
Lb, 1945, Revised March 20, 1946,' and any instructions issued
by the Technical Officer, as follows:

"Combined Phases I and II: The Contractor shall furnish the
necessary persomsel and facilities for and shall undertake (i)
the investigations involving electric circuits, video amplifiers,

y
gutdies of digital computetion, and the adaptation of problems
to this method of solution; (ii) the design and construction of
a Digital Computer and studies for applying the computer to an
Adreraft Analyzer based on results obtained from the foregoing;
and (141) shall furnish complete sets of drawings used in the
construction of the above computer, reports setting forth the
design and operation of all components of the computers, reporis
setting forth the results of studies of the gpplication of the
computer to an aircraft analyzer, and records of results of all
teats on individual components and assembled components cone
ducted up to June 30, 1949.

It is understood snd agreed that, although section (A) refers to
four (4) phases of the work in commectioniwith the WHIRLWIND
Project, no provision has been meade in the estimated cost to
cover the third and fourth phases of the work which relate to the
construction, assembly, housing, operation or preliminary testing
of the Electronic Computer and Aircraft Analyzer.”

It is the desire of the Government and the Contractor that addi-
tional research on an electronic digital computer and continued
component research be performed. To accomplish this, there are
hereby provided an extension in the period of performance of
Task Order I under Contract NSori-60 and an increase in the ese
timated cost thereof.

It is the desire of the Covernment and the Contractor that eddi-

tional research on an electronic digital computer and continued component
research be performed, and that the scope of the work be expanded

to include theoretical studies and experimental research end development in i
connection with the application of the digital computer in an air defénse
system in which information is transwitied from remote radar stations

and processed by a computer, and the application of the computer to
izportant scientific problems. To accomplish thés, there are hereby
provided an expansion in the scope of work, an extension in the period

of performance and an increase in the estimated cost of Task Order I

under Contract NSori-60,

L, On end after 1 July 1950, section (A) shall read as follows:

The Contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel and facilities
for and, in accordance with any instructions issued by the Technical
Officer or his authorized representative, shall confivet research to
include the following:

(1) investigations in commection with combined Phases I and II of
four phases of Project 2b-X3 (Formerly Project RF-12) in accordance
with "Specifications for Project RF.l2, known as WHIFLWIND, dated

i October 1945, revised 20 March 1946,' and to include (1) investi.
sations involving electric circuits, video amplifiers, electrostatic
storage tubes, electronic switching, mathematical solution; (ii) the
design and construction of a Digital Computer and the studies for
applying the computer to an Aircraft Analyzer based on results ob-
tained from the foregoing; ead (iii) shall furnish complete sete of
drawings used in the construction of the above compuiers, reports
setting forth the demign and operation of all components of the
computers, reports setting forth the results of studies of the
application of the computer to an aircraft analyzer, and records of
results of all tests on individual componente and sssembled compon-
ents conducted wp to 15 November 1950;

(2) theoretical studies and experimental research and development
in connection with the epplication of digital computers in an alr
defense system in which information ie transmitted to WHIRLWIND from
remote radar stations and processed by the computer, and

(3) eppliceticn of the computer to important scientific problems.”
5. On and after 1 July 1950, section (B) shall read as follows:

It is understood and agreed that, although section (A) (1) refers to
four (4) phases of the work in connection with the WHIRLWIND Project
no provision has been made in the estimated cost to cover the thind
