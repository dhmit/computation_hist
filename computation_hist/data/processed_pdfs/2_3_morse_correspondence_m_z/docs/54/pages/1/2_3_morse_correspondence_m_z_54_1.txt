Thu-o arc neural course related to digital computor given at
24.1.1'. during the acedonic year. However, thou course are available
only to than regularly aux-oiled either for dogma program or u
apecial students. Thue oouru are described in the N.I.T. analogue

A short com-ea is being given this murmur on the special topic

we would prefer postponing a visit to our installation for the
present. The IBM 704 is not yet installed and the next month or so will
be largely devoted to getting the computer into operation. If you are
still integrated in visiting the installation when the computer is
actually operating, we will be happy to consider a visit at that time.

Sincerely$ours ,
