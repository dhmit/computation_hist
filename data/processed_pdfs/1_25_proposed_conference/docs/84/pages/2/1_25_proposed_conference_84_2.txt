Dr. Grad 2w July 13, 1959

of Inviting each of these directors, so that there probably
would be between 40 and 50 attending. The attendance would be
larger and probably more representative, of course, if all or
part of the travel expenses of the conferees could be financed.,
If this conference were to get out a report which could be used
by the various diractors, present and prospective, and would be
avallable to NSP if eo desired, then the editing, preparing and
publication of this report would need to be financed. My letter
at present is just to sce if NSF is likely to be interested in
such a conference, if they would be wllling to finance some paxrt
of 1t and, if so, what we jshould do about it next. I will be
away in Europe during August and the first part of September so
I will not be on hand at the meeting mentioned in the enclosed
notice. If you have gquestions which should be brought up to
this meeting, I suggest you send them to Professor Frelberger.
In any ease, I will be back by September 10 and would be glad to
hear your comments then or before I leave on August 5. I think
it 1s about time that this growinz field of university computer
research, education and service be discussed in temms of its
broader impllcations and necessities. I hope you agree.

Yours,
