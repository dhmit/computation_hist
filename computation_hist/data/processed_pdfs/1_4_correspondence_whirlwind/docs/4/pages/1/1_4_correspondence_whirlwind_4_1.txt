Dear Phil :

After much discussion and hard work on the
part of staff and personnel in the S&EC group, we have
finally completed the COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM MANUAL describing
the Whirlwind I system.

I am enclosing a copy of this report for your
1.158.

You will recall our earlier discussions in which
we decided to prepare 500 copies of this report which would
be sold at $2.50 per copy. We are now receiving orders from
various groups for copies of this report.

Sincerely yours,
. M. Verzuh
