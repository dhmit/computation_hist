Dear Dr. Pusey:

1 am pleased to enclose a check for $500.00 for the second
semester portion of the Harvard University appointment to the M.I. T.
Computation Center as described on the attached sheet. The IBM
Corporation is very grateful for the work of the Research Associates

and Assistants in the program for they have contri buted a great deal to
its success. ;

There are now thirty-four colleges and universities in New
England participating with M.I. T. in the Computation Center. The new
IBM 709 has been in operation for four months, and already seventeen
of the colleges have made use of it. For your information, I am
enclosing a table of usage for the months September - December, 1960.

Sincerely yours,
