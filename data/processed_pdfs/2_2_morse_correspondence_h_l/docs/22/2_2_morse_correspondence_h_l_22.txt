Dear Professor Morse:

I am enclosing a copy of a conference to be held
here on February 6 in X-ray crystallography. I would
appreciate your passing the notice on to any interested
person at M.I. T.

I have still not received any of the Whirlwind | Lilia %

Project Reports or Technical Reports of the Project on
Machine Methods. I am very anxious to have these as work-i|
ing models for our center.

We have been fortunate in adding to our staff and
now have a full scale 650 operation. Three courses are being
taught in machine computation, a two semester course in
Numerical Analysis, and related courses in switching theory
under the E.E. department, and business data processing
u nder the Bureau of Business Research. In addition we have
been carrying on a research program sponsored largely by
industry working through the various departments of the
University.

This summer we hope to sponsor a significant
conference here at the Computing Center and I would welcome
any suggestions or recommendations you might be able to
give us in order to make this adventure successful.

Hoping to hear from you,

Sincerely,

Sad IS 00 | atl

William B. Kehl
