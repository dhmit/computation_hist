Statement of the Problem - ILarge, electronic digital compubters
have Breap pocenvialicies ror advancing research in the many areas
which reguire a great deal of drudge calculation, but up to nowy
their potential capabilities have been hawmpered by a "mismateh®
between wachine and possible user., Special input eguipment is not
vet designed to allow masses of experimental data to be fed directly
to the machine; special output equipment is needed in order to display
resultse in compact and easgily understandable formy and the present
. ¢olle of instructions %o the maching the "machine langauge" is not
easy to learn or To use.

The basic difficulty is that electronic computers are extremely
complex pieces of equipment and a great deal of study will be
reguired before we can understand its behavior well enough to be
able to control it effortlessly and flexibly., AV present one who
wishes to use a large computer often has to spend three to five months
developing, encoding and testing a program ©To instruct the machine hoiw
to perform the necessary millions of operations which, at the end, the
computer willl carry through in a few hours. True, these five months
of preparation plus the few hours of actual computation may be much
shorter than The several years required to obtain the same results by
using a desk computer, nevercheless 1t is obviously desirable to
devise procedures which will shorten this preparation time, even at
Tthe expense of additional machine time.

Program for Research on Machine Capabilities - 1In order to
learn Now O make Qigica .l computers easier o use one mwust have &
machine of large capaclity, a2 large supply of possible computations
to be done, drawn from a wide variety of scientific fields, plus a
staff which thoroughly understands the machine behavior and is
interested in working with the prospective users in order to simplify
methods of use, With this combination of eguipment and staff it
should be possible, in a few years, to work out special operating
programs, additional input and oubtput eguipment and other techniques
which will considerably reduce the time and effort required to get
& problem solved by the machine,

The M.I.T. Computation Center = The one place in the United
caves where this combination of machine, variety of problems and
tarff already exists iIs at M.I.T. This past year IBM has installed
. TO4, of the most up-to-date capacity for the use of the college
