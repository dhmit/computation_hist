Subject: Contract “5011. 06001, Task Order I 3
Proposal for extension beyond current expiration
date for the period 1 July 1953 through 30 June 1954

we propose to continue work on the subject contract as
restated in Amendment 13 for an additional year covering the period
1 July 1953 through 30 June 1951.. The work will consist of a coor-
dinated research program in applied mathenatics utilizing facilities in
the Center for Machine Computation including the Whirlwind computer in

the Digital Computer Laboratory. The work will include but not neces-
sarily be limited to the following:

(1) research in methods of numerical analysis and the
fornmlation of scientific problems for machine solution, to—
gether with the training of personnel in these methods;

(2) mpport of the scientific and engineering applica-
tions group of Project Whirlwind so as to make the computer
useful and available for the above research and

(3) partial support of the maintenance of the Whirlwind
Computer and research into digital computing machine components

including a. continuation of research being carried on in mag—
netic memory devices.

The Air Force is making a large contribution to the support
and extension of facilities of the Whirlwind Computer. Its use will
be shared by the Air Force and ONE. It is understood that details of

the program here proposed will be worked out from time to time with the
technical officer.
