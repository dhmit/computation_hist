Dear Dr. Morse:

This Project is interested in putting two problems,
both iterative , on an IBM Type 704 Electronic Data Processing
Machine. Since such a computer is or will be installed at MIT, I
would appreciate it if you would inform me as to its physical make-
up. This will permit me to judge whether or not the above-mentioned
problems are feasible on MIT's computer. In particular, I would like
to know how many words of core storage it will possess, the number
of magnetic drums, the number of magnetic tape units and whether a
cathode ray output will be available. In all other respects, I will
assume it to be standard.

I thank you for any trouble that you have gone through.

Sincerely yours,

Bs a es Si
