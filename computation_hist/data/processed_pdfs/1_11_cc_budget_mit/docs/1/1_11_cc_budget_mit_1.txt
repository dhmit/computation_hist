Dear Professor Morse:

In accordance with our recent discussions concerning

budget requirements for the MIT Computatioam- Center, I have prepared
the following reports:

1. CC-5: Electronic Data Processing Equipment in the
Computation Center
2. CC-1l: Budget Proposal for the MIT Computation Center
3. Financial Report of the Digital Computer Laboratory.
The above three reports contain pertinent information concerning the

present mode of operating Whirlwind and the extrapolating effects as
indicated in the budget report for the proposed budget.

I am looking forward to discussing these reports with you

in order that we may prepare a more accurate ''gray folder budget for
the administration.

Sincerely yours,
