Dear Alan:

In June I sent you the manuscript of the report of
the Conference of University Computing Center Directors, which

ol you had suggested could be published in the Communications of
ie ACM. I have not heard from you as to whether you received
iis this manuscript, as to whether it is to be published, and when.

> Could you let me know what the status is? In a letter accompany-
ing the manuscript I mentioned that we might want to obtaln a
fair number of reprints. Since the original copies of the report
are now all distributed we are anxious to know whether we will
be able to distribute reprints. Consequently, I would appreciate
hearing from you about this also.

As one editor to another may I suggest that a routine
acknowledgment of manuscripts sent to the Communications of ACM
would be appreciated by many contributors?
