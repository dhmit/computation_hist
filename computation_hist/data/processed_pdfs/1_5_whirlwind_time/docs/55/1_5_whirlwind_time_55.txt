Dear Sir:

7 I have been ‘authorized to credit your account
with 10 hours of machine time on the Whirlwind I computer
for work under problem 236, Neutron-Deuteron Scattering.

You might be interested to know that since your
problem began, you have used (as of May 6) 1,130.4 minutes
of machine time. if you had been charged at the regular
rate of $250/hour, the total amount charged to your account
would have been $4,710,338,

If you find that you need more time, it will be
necessary to submit a new request.

 

Sincerely,

 

PF. ¥M, Verzuh
