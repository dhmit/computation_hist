Dear Professor Brown?

As Indicated in my letter of November 5, 1952,
I am now enclosing a revised description of the content
of the proposed subject entitled Computation by Punched-
Card Methods, I would like to recommen Ths subject
be offered during the Fall Term 1953,

At the present time the Office of Statistical
Services does have a complete representation of IBM ma-
chines, In particular, the present availability of the
Card Programmed Calculator together with its general-
purpose plugboards enables one to set up problems in a
short time, Specifically, the instructions for a problem
may be written in less than an hour, Therefore this unit
is a most effective educational device, Furthermore, the
grant of a gratis installation consisting of an OR4 Key
Punch, an O82 Electronic Sorter, and an 402 Tabulator will
permit extensive laboratory use of such machines on an
individual student basis,

Very truly yours,

F. M, Verzuh
ViT

P, S. I am also enclosing an outline of the content of the
above subject.

A study of punched~card equipment with emphasis on
its application to statistical research and scientific
computation. The principles and application of the fol-
lowing machines are treated: card punch, verifier,
interpreter, sorter, collator, reproducer, accounting
machine, cardatype, models 602A and 604 calculators, and
the card-programmed calculator, Mathematical procedures
include evaluation of higher-order differences, interpolae
tion, solution of simultaneous equations, inversion of
matrices, extraction of square roots, evaluation of roots
of polynomials, solution of differential and integral
equations, and the performance of statistical and educa-
tional research, Actual use of the machines is made by the
student. |
