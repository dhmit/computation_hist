1, The MIT Automatic Operator Program

The MIT Automatic Operator Program provides the 704 user with
a flexible scheme for tape-to-tape computer.operafibn involving a minimum
of intervention by the human operator, Two immediate advantages which
result are greater efficiency and accuracy in computer operation, A third,
and perhaps less obvious advantage is that runs of greater complexity may
be safely scheduled by the user, This need not necessarily imply a great
saving of actual computer time, but it may enable the user to obtain re-
sults in a single run which normally might require several runs spread
over several calendar days,

An attempt has been made to minimize the number of restrictions
which the system places on the user, Thus the user proceeds much as he
normally would: using SAP and FORTRAN 1 for Ã©ssemblies, reading in and
operating binary decks, and using MIPMR1 and NYDS1 for dumps., To use the
system he need only sacrifice the first eight registers of core memory and
six magnetic tape units, This latter restriction may, of course, be fatal
in many problems,

The logical tape units used by the system are the following:

Unit Function
1 SYSTEM TAPE
2 PRINTER OUTPUT TAPE
3 PUNCH OUTPUT TAPE
4 RUN INPUT TAPE
5 BINARY OUTPUT TAPE

6 ., BINARY INPUT TAPE
The operator Program, other utility programs, and subroutine libraries
are permanently recorded on the SYSTEM TAPE. The PRINTER OUTPUT TAPE and
the PUNCH OUTPUT TAPE are used to hold information which the operator pro-
gram records for off-line printing and punching, The user is required to
use -these for the same purpose, The programs and operating instructions
for a run (or for several runs) are recorded on the RUN INPUT TAPE, The
BINARY OUTPUT TAPE and the BINARY'INPUT TAPE are used by the operator pro-
gram for temporary storage during the execution of a run,

Runs are recorded in sequence on the RUN INPUT TAPE using the
