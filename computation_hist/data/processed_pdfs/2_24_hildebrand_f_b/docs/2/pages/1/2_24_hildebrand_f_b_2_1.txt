Dear Professor Martin:

These machines were purchased by the Center of Analysis for
use in the desk-calculator section. More recently, these
machines have been used Jointly by the staff of the Numerical
Analysis Laboratory and by students in the former numerical
analysis subjects 6.531 - 6.534.

It is evident from the above purchase dates that
the machines are get new and have seen considerable use. I
have therefore recommended that the existing service con-
tracts on the Merchant calculators be maintained in order
that reliable service will be available during the forth-
coming period of heavy student use. Accordingly; I have
submitted 5 invoices ($60 per year per machine) to
Miss Goodwin for payment.

Neither the Monroe or the National Cash Register
machines have been on a service contracti and repairs are
therefore obtained by calling the respective agency.
