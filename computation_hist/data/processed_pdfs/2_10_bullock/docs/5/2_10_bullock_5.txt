Dear Dr. Verzuh

I am enclosing four copies of an IBM Maintenance
Agreement which is required for the Real Time Package which
has been installed and is now in use on the 704. The effective
date is July 1, 1959. The monthly charges as agreed upon in
your letter of April 29, 1958, are $83.50. I would appreciate
your returning all copies of this agreement with appropriate
signatures to me at your earliest convenience.

As soon as an Agreement Number has been assigned,
we shall return one copy to you.

Sincerely yours,
