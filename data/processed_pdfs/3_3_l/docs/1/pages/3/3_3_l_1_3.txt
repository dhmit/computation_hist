Dear Phil:

This is to express my appreciation to you for the very
valuable assistance which you are providing to the machine
translation project through making your facilities available
to Yngve and the others of his group and through the advice
which you and the members of your group have given so
generously.

The even closer association which you are going to make
possible next month by assigning Siegel, Helwig, and Best

to work with Yngve on efficient methods of doing translation
problems on the 704 is certainly going to allow our men to
move ahead faster.

Word is going around that in February Georgetown University
"will demnstrate on an IBM 705 complete translation of over
1000 Russian sentences in context, handling all syntactical
and lexical problems." They claim to have made a major
break-through in the handling of syntax. This is going to
put our boys on their mettle, so I know they are going to
appreciate doubly the opportunity to work more closely with
your people.

Sincerely, . /
//
