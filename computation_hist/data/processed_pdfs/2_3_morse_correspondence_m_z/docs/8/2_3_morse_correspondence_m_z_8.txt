more than .one hundred scientists and engineers from How England
colleges will take the first step toward  using -the facilities of
the new M.l. T. Computation Center at s special two—week program
opening at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on August 20.

They wiII learn the principles of preparing problems to be :
solved by a modern high~speed co; Tmuting mochine.v Their. study will
be in preparation for their use of the IBM type 70b Date Process-
.ing Machine, e large electronic computer, which will be installed
at H.I.T. later this year.

The program will‘mark_the opening of a cooperatiue venture
between 18%, N.I.T., and ___ other New England colleges to increase
the numbers of scientists and engineers qualified to use modern
computing machines, and to learn more about their application to
research problems in many fields.

Under special arrangements with the International Business
Machines Corporation, the type 70h computer will be operated at
M.I.T. to solve problems brought by research workers in a wide
ovariety of fields at the participating New England colleges. Those
attending the program beginning on August 20, according to Fro-
fessor Philip M. Morse of M.I.T., who directs the Computation
Center, will be those who expect to use the machine as soon as it
is available early in 1957.

The two—week program will be given by nine members of the
N.I.T. staff, two representatives of International Business
Machines Corporation, and one faculty member from a participating

During the two-week period of the course all its members will
visit International enemies adenine: headquarters in 'Foughkeepsie,
New York to see a Type 70h computer in operation and to inspect
production facilities there. I

In addition to physicists and engineers, teachers and graduate*

' students in economics, astronomy, business administration, and

 

mathematics will attend the program at M,I;T. The following col-
leges and universities - in addition to M.I.T. - will send representa-
tives: Boston.College, Bowdoin College, Brandeis University, Brown
University, University of Connecticut, Dartmouth College, Harvard
University, at. Holyoke College, University of New Hampshire,
Northeastern University, University of Rhode Island, Tufts Univer-
sity, University of Vermont, Wellesley College, Wesleyan University,

1 Williams college, Worcester Polytechnic Instithte, and Yale Univer-
sity.

With a staff of more than 30 people, the M.I.T. Center will be
the largest and most versatile data processing facility yet made
available primarily for education and basic research. IBM not only
will install the machine — in special space in M.I.T.'s new Karl
Taylor Compton Laboratory - but will contribute the cost of main—
taining and operating it.
