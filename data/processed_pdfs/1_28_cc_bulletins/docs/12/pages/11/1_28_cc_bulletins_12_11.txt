d8) If nomnumeric other than a commz or blank is found in colwm 13,
the variable field will be scamned and dummy arguments will be identified. A
dumny argument should begin the field so that a count may be later substituted.
No sequence of characters should be longer than six characters between break
characters; longer sequences will be truncated on the left by the scamning
routine, The first blank encountered will terminate the scan., When the macro
ie expanded, the argument which is supplied to take the first positicn in the
BCD string must contain the correct word count for the entire BCD string.
Example:

NTR C ' (NTR=TZXI)
B (BRA=TXL)
B (XIT=TTR)

To use the macro OUTPUT, a format statement would be supplied to correspond to
the argument A and a string of variables to be printed would be supplied to
replace B, C and D would be normally supplied by created symbols, as in this
call to print floating point numbers X and Y3

MAC OUTPUT(2(1Hb2EL9,8))K,Y)

The left-most character in the first argument becomes the BCD word count,

Note that blanks (represented here by lowsr case b) may be used im the BCD ex-
pressions substituted whem the expressions are enclosed by parentheses; the re-
strictions are only on theiyr use in definitiomns,

DEC, CCT and OPD Within Macro Defimitions

If the variable field of a DEC card begims with 0,1,2 ..., 8, +, ., or
comma, the DEC card will be stored unchamged as part of the macro definitiom
in wvhich it occurs, If any character other than those listed above occurs in
columm 12, the variable field will be scanned to identify any dummy arguments,
In the latter case, sequences of not longer than 6 characters between break
characters will be handled correctly. A DEC card should not use K or B as the
pame of a dummy argument, The following examples are correct: :

MOP EXAMP1 A X

DEC 1.0E+8,5,33333335-02 No substi-
DEC .5 tution implied
DEC A,A,X, X, X

DEC A,1,0ELD,X,3,0810,A

END EXAMP1

The folloving exsmple is ineorrect, due to the length of the numbers:

MOP EXAMP3, A
DEC A, 12345678
END EXAMP2
