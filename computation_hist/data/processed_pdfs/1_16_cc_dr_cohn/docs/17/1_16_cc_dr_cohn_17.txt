0N FINITENESS CONDITIONS FOR A CONVEX BODY
HARVEY COHN

1 Introduction. In certain problems .Of. geometric number theory,
such as the study of critical lattices. It 15. important to lmow when 3
ﬁnite convex body surroundlllg the origin Will contain no lattice
point other than the origin in its interior. In this brief note we shall
discuss a situation in which it sufﬁces to know that only aﬁmite set 0‘
lattice points are not interior to the body. In the companion article
[1], we shall show that the results of the present article enable us

to reduce the determination of critical lattices in d dimensions to a

ﬁnite number of steps.

2. Main theorem. Let K be a _convex body in d-dimensional eu.
tlidean space containing in its interior the hypersphere 2.,(7) of radius ,
and center at the origin (r<1). Let us always consrder the lam-me of
points with integral coordinates. Then if K fails to contain in its in-
terior those lattice points (other than the origin) in a second sphere
EACH/rd”), then it will contain in its interior-no latticeApoints at all
except the origin. In fact K will then he entirely within the second
sphere. .

Pnoor. We shall establish the value Cd = 24—ldI‘((d+1)/2)1r—<r1—u/2_

We let (x.-) be an arbitrary point outside of 240), that is, we let
Exf=Rt>r’, and we join this point to its negative by a line, namely
A(x.-), through the origin. We let H(x.-) be the (d—1)-dimensioua1
hyperplane through the origin and perpendicular to this line, and we
let 2.1-, (r; x.) be the intersection of this plane with the solid sphere
2,,(1). For our immediate purposes we deﬁne “(7; x.) as the (solid)
cone formed by the segments joining each point of 2.1-, (r; x,») with
(an); and for later purposes we deﬁne K(r; 96;) as the (solid) cone with
spherical base formed by joining with (xi) each point of Ed(r). Now
K(r; x.) will prove useful when we seek the best Cd, since this solid
is a minimal body which any convex body K must contain in order
to contain both 24(r) and (xi). For our immediate purposes, we need
only note that the convex body K will (easily) contain K(r; x.) and
that the latter body has the very handy value wg_1r"—1R/d for its
volume, where wt=1r"/’/I‘(1+k/2), the k-dimensional volume of the
unit sphere in la dimensions.

We now note that u(r; x.) will contain a lattice point (not the origin)
if R; Cd/rd—l. This is a simple consequence of Minkowski's theorem
on convex bodies [3, p. 60]‘ For the body formed by the union of
K0; xi) and K0; —x.-) is symmetric and has volume not less than 2".
Hence there would have to be a lattice point. (not the origin) in each
of the two symmetric halves. From this the theorem follows easily.

3_ Best constant. The preceding estimates can be improved
slightly. For instance we may take into account the fact that the
convex bodies, K(r; x.) and its integral translates, can not pack space
more densely than do the (d —1)-dimensional spheres (which are pre-
cisely their intersections with planes parallel to II(x.-)). Then we im-
mediately obtain an improvement of Cd to Cj=de4_ry,§‘_‘,”/’2—("““
(where 7;” is the maximum euclidean distance separating the clos-
est points of any d-dimensional lattice of determinant unity). But

using even the lower estimates [2, pp. 23—24] on 74-x, we ﬁnd the
improvement is not substantial, that is, as d—>ao, log Cd~log Cd,
~(d/ 2) log (1.

Going in the other direction we can show that there is a best con-
stant for C4 as r—>0. To recapitulate, our main theorem was deduced
from Minkowrki's theorem. It could also have been deduced from the
simultaneous approximation theorem, as the remaining proof will sug~
gest, but the constant C; would not have been as good. The converse
of Minkowski's theorem, or the Minkowski-leaka theorem [4], is
inapplicable since the problem is not afﬁne invariant. The converse
of the simultaneous approximation theorem, or (essentially) Perron's
transferal principle [2, p. 67], is, however, applicable and we shall
now look to it for a proof that a best Cd, which we shall call (2:,
exists.

For the calculation of the best constant, we take a minimal con-
vex body, which is “evasive” of lattice points, namely K"
=K(r; rim/(23931)“), reaching to distance p from the origin in the
direction (0,(=1), 02, . - - , 0.1). The 6;, are chosen, from the Perron
transferal principle, to span (say) a real algebraic ﬁeld of degree d
(for convenience, 0 <0), g1). Then a constant gs (called Cd in [2]) will
exist with the property that “the forms lplﬂt—ptl , for 2 $12 éd, admit
a simultaneous approximation no better than (gdp}/(“‘l)“,” that is,
for p,>P.(e), the inequality 1M..— ptl 2((gt+e)p}""”)“ will hold
for some 12 depending on p1 and e, and satisfying 2ékéd,

We now let p increase from r until it reaches the ﬁrst value pa for
which K‘ has a lattice point (pr) on its surface. If we took r small
enough (<ro(e)) then this lattice point would satisfy the inequality

point (19;) to the line Mag), then easily r>8 (since 1 is the maximum
distance from a point of K“ to A(9.-)), and B > [pi’l“‘)(gd+e) (29:)1/:]_1_

convex body K“ can attain without containing an interior lattice
point other than the origin, Thus it easily follows that Cd’ g C32“

Even using very simple methods, we can improve as somewhat; but
still, on the basis of present information on ga[2, p. 72], we can show
only that as d—m, log CEI/(d log 41) lies between 1/2 and —1. At
any rate, the function 64/14", appearingrin the main theorem, is
seen to contain the best possible power of r. .
