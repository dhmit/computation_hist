MEMORANDUM
To: °  P. V. Cusick ‘Date: November 27, 1956
From: F. M. Verzuh

Subject: Bursar's Accounts To Be Used in the M.I.T. Computation Center

 

In accordance with cur discussions concerning the list of Bursar's |
Accounts which are to be used in connection with the M.I.T. Computation Center,
I have prepared the attached list of accounts. This list has been discussed
with Professors Morse and Floe, and Messrs. P. V. Cusick, J. A. Little,
F. L, Foster, T. W. Bowilcik, and F. M. Verzuh, and has met with their approval.

In regard to the matter of the National Science Foundation Account,
Dr. Foster insists that the NSF Appropriation remain as a DSR project «= X
DSR 7573 has been set up for this account. The NSF project will therefore
rengin as a DSR project where charges to the account will be made from the
M.I.T. Computation Center OPERATING Account (2756).

The Computation Center has been set up as an interdeparimental
laboratory with set of accounts analogous to that of an academic department, and
these accounts will be budgeted in what is commonly known as the gray folder
budget procedure. The following accounting office numbers have heen assigned:

A STAFF SALARIES | : #1545

For salaries of certgin members of computation staff,

B ACCESSORY TO TEACHING #1550.26
Secretarial pssistance to zbove staff members.

C STAFF SALARIES #15895 ,32

For DSR credits received for any men in the first account who is
charged tc a DSR contract.

D ACCESSORY TO TEACHING # 1556.26

Secretarial salaries charged to DSR contracts.

B EXPENSES #1783

Migcellansous expenses such as, spocial lecturers honoraria, etc.

, not covered by any IEM agreement or contract which should be
charged to MIT General Funds rather than the Computation Centsy
Operating Account. :
