Dear Carl:

I am trying to use my office in Room 28-146 and find
that there is no acoustical isclation between this room and the
704 room. The situation, I belive, is created by a defective
metal door between room 146 and room 150, At any rate, it is
impossible to discuss financial matters in this area without being
overheard in the other room,

What steps can be taken to correct this situation?

I am sorry to bother you with matters which seem to be
minor items, Om the other hand, they seriously interfere with
the effective conduct of business.

Sincerely yours,

F., M, Verzuh
