Rough Draft, May 12, 1959, Page 2

National Science Foundation would be willing to be of financlal
help. What is needed, however, is some indlcation from you who
are directing university computing centers as to the need for
such a meeting and the possible agenda, 1f 1t 1s needed. There
is to be an Eastern Computer Conference in Cambridge later in the
year. This meeting could be scheduled near 1f 1f such action
seemed appropriate. On the other hand, there may be advantages in
meetings separate from such large convocatlions at some quiet spot
where we could talk things over at leisure. Or, of course, we
should not meet at all.

I will be again at the IBM Conference in June where, I am
sure, the topic will come up again. I would certainly appreciate
your comments on this general question, particularly if they can
reach me before June 15.

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse, Director
MIT Computation Center
