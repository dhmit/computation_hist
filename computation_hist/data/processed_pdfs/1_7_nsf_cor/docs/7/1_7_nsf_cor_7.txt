PROPOSAL FOR EXTENSION 0? NSF GRANT No. “8170293;
W

Proposal

Although our IBM 70a is now delivered and is in storage at
MIT, delay in completion of the building to house it has delayed
commencement of-the project financed by NSF grant NSF 029HO. As
a result, it is estimated that only about $8,000 will have been
spent by June 30. 1957. Staff members. which were to have been
transferred to this project, have been continued on the Whirlwind
project until the change-over, and most of them will not be trans-
ferred until summer. It is therefore proposed that the proJect be
continued until June 30. 1958. with an additional grant of only
$13,000, so that in the full year of full operation, July 1957 to
June 1958. we can operate at the rate of'$35,000 a year, as
estimated in last year's forecast. Estimated details of budget
are appended, together with eXeerpts from the original proposal.

Progress to Date

Although the NSF funds have not been used to any extent, work
on the first aspects of the proposed research has gone forward
as rapidly as is possible without the 704 being in running condi-
tion° A complete utility and a post-mortem program have been
developed, and tested out on borrowed 70” time, a much more
flexible assembly program than at present available has been
begun, ready for active coding when our 70“ is in operation.
Discussions have been begun with a view to investigating the
incorporation of a flexible output equipment utilizing the
photographic "linotype" equipment called Photon. Many programs
of importance in physics and engineering have been, or are being
translated from Whirlwind language to 70h language, such as the
work of the Solid State Theory Group under Prof. J. c. Slater
and the largeoshower calculations of Prof. Bruno Rossi. The
meteorology group under Prof. Charney, recently moved here from
Princeton where their work was initiated by Von Neumsnn, is
planning to use a substantial amount of machine time, and will
require the advice and help of our staff to program their various
calculations. We will be assisting the Harvard Observatory staff
in calculating satellite orbits in preparation for, and during,
the IGY satellite "shoots". Dr. S. Ulam of Los Alamos, who has
been a Visiting Fellow to the Center this year, has been assisting
us develop "Monte Carlo" techniques. Prof. John McCarthy of the
Dartmouth Mathematics Department (one of the New England colleges
participating in our program) will be here next year and will be
interested in developing machine logic and in further investiga-
tions of the behavior of "automata" by means of simulation pro-
grams. The staff of the MIT library is interested in exploring
the possibilities of storing and recovering information by
machine methods and a project in the MIT Language Department on
machine translation, supported by the Rockefeller Foundation,
expects to use our equipment to test out their ideas. other

groups, at the 23 participating colleges, are planning further
work.

Plans for Next Year

All of these projects, and more, will stretch the capabilities
and energies of the Computation Center staff. We expect to add
two more senior staff members this summer and hope “persuade two
men now completing their Doctor's degrees to stay on as Junior
staff members for a year or two. It is certain that most'of the
, research subjects outlined in our original proposal to NSF will
be begun this coming year; it can be expected that the NSF portion
of support for this work will reach the yearly rate of $35,000
as indicated earlier, and it is expected that this yearly rate
will continue at about the same level for several further years,
as was forecast in our original proposal (see Enclosure B).

We therefore request that Grant NSF 029110 be extended to
June 30. 1958, with additional funds of $13,000.

Title of Proposed Research: ‘
Research on Digital Computer Operation and Utilization

Investigation into the patterns of operation of electronic
digital computers and the methods whereby they can be used in
mathematical and experimental research; including studies of
numerical analysis and machine programming methods, investigation
of the possibilities of the complete mechanization of the sequence
of recording, processing, analysis and presentation of experi-
mental data and the working out of such specific applications of
machine techniques to problems in science, engineering, and
administration as will clarify the basic research and suggest new
points of view.

Desired Starting Date: September 1, 1956..

 

Time Periods Three years, with a reassessment during the fall of
1959 to detemine whether further support is advisable.

Proposed Research - Baclfground Intonation:

 

We are organizing what should be one of the most fruitful
centers for research related to the use of electronic computers
in this country. IBM is contributing one of its 701% machines,
maintained and equipped with appropriate auxiliary equipment.
IBM and MIT are providing the building, part of the new Compton
laboratory, and MIT is contributing some of the staff from its
departments of mathematics, electrical engineering, physics, and
industrial management“ The machine will be available, 35 or more
hours a week, free of machine time charge, to MIT staff and
students for nonoclassified and non-routine research. MIT

research in the Center will be coordinated by the Institute
mchine Computation Committee.

In addition, the Center will be available, up to 35 hours
a week, on the same basis, to other colleges in New Englde
Already 23 institutions have indicated their interest in parti-
cipating and have appointed faculty members to be their Insti-
tutional Representative“ These representatives will coordinate
the research done on the machine by students and staff of their
institution. IBM is providing some funds for stipends for

graduate students who wish to learn machine use by helping with
some of this research.


Extension of N8? 029% Page 5
Enclosure 3, continued

In this atmosphere and with these facilities, there is an
unparalleled opportunity to do important and basic research in
all phases of the use 'of digital computers in science, engineering,
and business. A central research group, supervised by faculty
members and staffed by workers picked from the graduate students
of MIT and other colleges, working closely with persons from the
other colleges, will help coordinate the work of the Center and
will carry on research of their own in machine logic, in tech-
niques of machine computation, and in specific applications of
machine operation toexperimental and theoretical problems, thus
appreciably broadening the range of applicability of computers
in the physical and social sciences and in engineering. »

It is appropriate for government agencies to help support
the research of this central research group. The group's work
will, in part, provide an expanding basis of knowledge of numeri-
cal analysis and programing techniques, which can be used by the
other participants at the Center and will, in part, break ground
in new fields of mathematical logic and methods of, data processing

which will, be needed. in the application of digital computers to
new tasks.

Most of the senior staff for such a research group is
already assembled at the Institute. Part of it is the group which
developed Whirlwind I programming; others are in various depart-
ments of the Institute. From time to time, some of the staff of
the participating colleges will Join it for a semester or a year,
on leave from their institution, to work full time at the Center.

IBM and the Institute will contribute about a half million
dollars a year to provide the equipment, building, maintenance and
operating staff of the Center. 'We believe that a contribution of
about $120,000 a year will support the activities of the central
research group, which will energize and take the lead in the
research carried on at the Computation Center by students and
staff of MIT and the participating colleges. We list later in
this proposal some of the specific research projects we are pre-
pared to start on. other projects will develop naturally from

these and from the problems encountered by the other workers at V
the Computation Center.

Part of these additional funds can be obtained from some
of the research projects which will use the facilities of the
Center“ Although the use of the machine itself will not be
chargeable, most users will need advice from the Center staff as
to preparing their pmgrams, will need help in detailed coding
and will prefer to have our staff carry out many of the actual
runs on the computer. This will add to the duties of the staff,
and part of the additional cost will be charged to those projects
which can afford this extra serviceo Those students and faculty
members who cannot afford to pay for this help will be able to
use the machine, but will be expected to do their own coding,

card-punching, testing and running 01" their problems. We

estimate $50,000 a year can come from payments from other

grojects for the programing service described, leaving about
70,000 a year to be obtained from other sources.

The Rockefeller Foundation has granted the Computation
Center about $100,000 for three years, beginning July 1, 1957,
for the support or a staff to investigate applications of
digital computers in the social sciences. Thus only about
$35,000 a yearis needed to complete the support of the Center
staff, enough to support that part of the staff concentrating on
the physical science aspects of the activity. In order to get
our plans well under way, this grant should be continued for
about three years (as' with the Rockefeller grant), after which

the program should be re—evaluated to determine needs beyond
that date. ~

WM - gaggle gang; greetions of Investigation

1. Investigation of Structure and Syntax of input languages;

the possibilities of coding directly in mathematical, logical or
business language. -

2. Development or routines capable of translatirg from
algebraic notation to computer code and vice versa, including

possibly automatic selection of numerical techniques and auto-
matic error analysis.

3. Development of numerical analytic techniques particu-
larly suitable for use by digital computers; such as more
general expansions, truncated Chebyshev polynomial sums for
simulating standard functions by a common block of instructions
but small separate blocks of coefficients and cycle counters and
methods of automatic determination of best grid spacing, by trial
plus Richardson extrapolation or other means.

ll. Investigation of Monte Carlo techniques for large
problemsa

5. Extension and/or improvement or present techniques for
communication between machine and operator and for the more
flexible control of machine operation, including possible,
improvements in input-output equipment.

6. Experimental analysis and control using data trans-
mitted directly between computer and experiment.

7. Investigation of microprogramming and other methods for
increasing the flexibility of computer design. The possibility
of inclusion of a very flexible control unit in a large-scale
computer which would permit ready alteration of an order code.

8. Investigation of techniques for intercommnication
between computers, including the possibility of cycles different
in length or kind running simultaneously with frequent comparison,
e.g., several single-accumulator computers with common msmory,snd
the behavior of a computer with multiple accumulators. Some of

these properties can be simulate on s 01; by utilisation of
additional drums and magnetic core banks.

9. Computer estimation of problem time. In linear problems,
estimations of bounds of certain functionals, and thence conver-

gence criteria for teminating iteration, or switching to a
different iteration.

Facilities:

The MIT Computation Center will have a Type 7015 Electronic
Data Processing Machine with the following mhine complement:
12 magnetic tape units, 2 magnetic core storage units containing
a total of 8,000 words, 1 magnetic drum unit containing 15000
words of storage, the usual on-line punched card reader, alpha-
betic printer, and punched card recorder as well as the 3 off-line
magnetic-tape-contmlled printer, magnetic—tape-controlled
punch, and punched card-to—magnetic tape converter, respectively.
In addition to the 70“ there will be 10 auxiliary punched card
machines including card punches, collators, sorters, reproducers,
interpreters, and the Type 160 Accounting Machine. The aggregate

machine rental, in excess of 50,000 per month, will be donated
by IBM.

The Type 7% EDP)! unit is one of the fastest large-scale
commercial computers available today. Since. the MIT installation
will be but one of many in the field, techniques, programs, and
numerical procedures developed for this machine will be of use
to others having access to 701‘ equipment.
