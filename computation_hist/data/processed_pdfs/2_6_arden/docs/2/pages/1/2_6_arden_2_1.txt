Dear Mr. Dalton:

Thank you for your letter requesting information
concerning courses and opportunities at M.I.T. in the
digital compyfer area. In the Mathematics Department an
excellent two-semester sequence on numerical analysis 1is
offered by Professor Hildebrand. The quality of these
courses can be deduced from an inspection of Professor
Hildebrand's recent book. In the more theoretical area of
applied mathematics, excellent courses are offered from time
to time by Professors Lin and Lkeissner. Many excellent courses
pertaining to applied mathematics are also given in the Physics
Department. In particular, the two-semester sequence on
the methods of theoretical physiles offered by Professors Morse
and Feshbach is an excellent introduction to applied mathe-
maties and in particular with regard to its relation to physiecs.
I am sure you are familiar with their two-volumne series in
this area.

Currently, a course in automata 1s being offered in
the Mathematics Department by Dr. Marvin Minsky. There are
also courses on this subject in the Electrical Engineering
Departmen Â¢ which are taught by Professors John MeCarthy, E.
Arthurs, Richard Jeffries and myself. In the area of information
theory, we have both Professors Shannon and Elias and in the
logical design of digital circults, Professor Huffman is an
expert.

Opportunities for assistantships are available here
at the Computation Center and in general elsewhere in the
Institute. I suggest that you contact the department in which
you would propose to enroll regarding further information on
this subject.
