| Subject: Analogue Computer Charges

In reviewing the records of the Mechanical Engineering
Analogue Computer facility, it has been noted that certain computer
use charges inadvertently were not made against project 7125. The
dates and amounts involved are as follows:

 

Date of Use : Charge
January, 1960 “$90.00
February, 1960 220.00
March, 1960 30.00
August, 1960 50.00

£390.00

Although the project under which the computer time was used
hae since terminated, we note that it has been continued by project 8865.
Would you please furnish us with authorization to make the above charges
to the continuation project.

If there are any questions in regard to this matter, my extension
is 3868.
