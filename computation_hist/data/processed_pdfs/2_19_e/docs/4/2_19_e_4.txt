Dear Admiral Cochrane:
Last October, we wrote to inform you of a reduction in the
standard hourly rate for our IBM 704 Computer from $635 to $475. A
steadily inreasing volume of work has now lowered our costs suffi—
ciently to enable us to make another reduction. Effective as of

January 15, our standard hourly rate is $229.

This rate applies when less than 20 hours are used in a three-
month period, or when less than 10 hours are used within a period of
one month. Usage in excess oﬁ 20 hours in three months, or in excess
of 10 hours in one month, entitles the user to a quantity rate of
$329 per hour.r 7

We offer special open-end agreements which give the pur-
chaser the benefit of the highest discount to which the hours actually
utilized in any one month entitle him. Since large users of omputer
time may earn substantial negotiated discounts under this plan, it may
be of special interest to you.

As I noted in my previous letter, the use of all peripheral
equipment necessary for getting data into the 704, or for obtaining
the output from the 704 in desired form, is offered as a free courtesy
to clients using our 704; Ourioff-line equipment includes a Card-to-
Tape Converter, and a Tape Data Selector which provides great output
flexibility, inluding tape—to-card and tape-to-printer operations.
Programming services are also available to put your problems on the
IBM 704, or on any other machine.

For more detailed information as to how our services may be
applied to your problems, please fill out and return the enclosed

postage-free card.

Herbert H. Robinson
