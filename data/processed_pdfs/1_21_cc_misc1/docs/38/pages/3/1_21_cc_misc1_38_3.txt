Amendment No. 11

(6/29/56)

"(A)

"(B)

Tt is the desire of the Government and the Contractor that addi-

tional research on an electronic digital computer and continued component
research be performed, and that the scope of the work be expanded

to include theoretical studies and experimental research and development in
connection with the application of the digital computer in an air defense
system in which information is transmitted from remote radar stations

and processed by a computer, and the application of the computer to
important scientific problems. To accomplish this, there are hereby
provided an expansion in the scope of work, an extension in the period

of performance and an increase in the estimated cost of Task Order I
under Contract NSori-60.

4, On and after 1 July 1950, section (A) shall read as follows:

The Contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel and facilities
for and, in accordance with any instructions issued by the Technical
Officer or his authorized representative, shall conduct research to
include the following:

(1) investigations in connection with combined Phases I and II of
four phases of Project 24-X-3 (Formerly Project RF-12) in accordance
with ?Specifications for Project RF-12, known as WHIRLWIND, dated

4 October 1945, revised 20 March 1946,' and to include (i) investi-
gations involving electric circuits, video amplifiers, electrostatic
storage tubes, electronic switching, mathematical solution; (ii) the
design and construction of a Digital Computer and the studies for
applying the computer to an Aircraft Analyzer based on results ob-
tained from the foregoing; and (iii) shall furnish complete sets of
drawings used in the construction of the above computers, reports
setting forth the design and operation of all components of the
computers, reports setting forth the results of studies of the
application of the computer to an aireraft analyzer, and records of
results of all tests on individual components and assembled compon-
ents conducted up to 15 November 1950;

(2) theoretical studies and experimental research and development
in connection with the application of digital computers in an air
defense system in which information is transmitted to WHIRLWIND from
remote radsy stations and processed by the computer, and

(3) application of the computer to important scientific problems."
5. On and after 1 July 1950, section (B) shall read as follows:

Tt is understood and agreed that, although section (A) ยง1) refers to
four (4) phases of the work in connection with the WHIRLWIND Project
no provision has been made in the estimated cost to cover the third
and fourth phases of the work which relate to the construction,
assembly, housing, operation or preliminary testing of the Electronic
Computer and Aircraft Analyzer,"
