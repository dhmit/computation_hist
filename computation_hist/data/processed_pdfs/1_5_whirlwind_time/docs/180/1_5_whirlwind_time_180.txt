Dear Sir:

I have been authorized to credit your
scoount with 25 bours of machins time on tho Whirlwind
I computer for the computation of integrals essentlal
in ouantum-mechanical computations on molecules and
sollds.

If you find that mere computer time is need-
1

ed, it will be necess.ry that a new request be submil-
ted.

I hope that these arrangements will prove
eatisfactory.

Sincerely,

o
