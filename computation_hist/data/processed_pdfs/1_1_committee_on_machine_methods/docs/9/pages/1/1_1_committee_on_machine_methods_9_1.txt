Minutes of the Ninth Meeting
of the
Committee on Machine Methods of Computation

February 7, 1951

ggpggpg Present: J. W. Forrester, Z. Kopal, C. Lin, P. M. Morse
- and E. Reissner

Morse reported a discussion with E. S. Bevans and William
Weems, of the Industrial Liaison Office, concerning a possible
conference for industrial executives on the possibilities for
the use of large computing machines in industrial research.
They had suggested a day—and-a—half conference, the first half
day being a general discussion of types of machines and their
spheres of usefulness; a second half day, a discussion of
analogue computers and a visit to the differential analyzer;
and a third half day, a discussion of large digital computers
and a visit to Whirlwind. Forrester brought up the question as
to whether this was not overlapping the similar conference on
new communication techniques to be run by Professor Fano of the
Electrical Engineering Department. Forrester will talk to
Bevans and see whether this overlap is large or not. If the
overlap is not large, we can schedule the conference this
spring, perhaps on April 30 and May 1; if the overlap is large,
the suigestion would be to wait until next fall.

‘ The Committee discussed the program of the seminar to be

held hednesday afternoons. Professor Allis will talk this
week and perhaps continue next week. A Professor T. Jones, of
the Electrical Engineering Department, is proposing a thesis
on the efficiency and accuracy of large—scale analogue com—
puters. It was suggested that he could talk on this proposal
perhaps on February 14th or Elst, and at the same time the
seminar could visit the analogue computer of Hall. Professor
Kopal will talk to Jones and see about the arrangements. Morse
suggested that Professor Buerger, of the Geology Department,
could report on a proposal for a special machine to analyze
x—ray data. This perhaps could be scheduled for February Blst
or 28th. Mr. Reis is to finish his calculations on turbulence
in the near future and Lin suggested that he could report on
this either February 28th or March 7th. Kopal's problem in
astrophysics is being worked on at present, using the “Beac”.
The results of this work could be reported about March 14th.
It is requested that other suggestions for future seminar pro-
grams be sent in to Morse in the near future.
