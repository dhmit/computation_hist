the contents of the MQ register would be 0102212260608'

A literal may 22325.2212.55_322 address subfield of the
variablelfiglg.gi‘i.zgg machine operation. This means
that when the character "=" is used, it must be the first
character of the variable field, that this character may
not appear in the variable field of a pseudo-operation,
and finally that a subfield which contains a literal must
consist solely of that literal. Other subfields may be
present following a literal subfield, in which case the
separating comma is used in the usual manner, except in
the case of a Hollerith literal, where the separating
comma would be the eighth character following the equal
sign and intervening commas or blanks would be taken as
data and would not have their usual function of determin-

ing the variable field.

A literal may not appear in the variable field of a type-

D operation.

The number of data words generated by literals in a

program may not exceed 1000.
