Dr. Grad =2 July 13, 1959

of inviting each of these directors, so that there probably
would be between 40 and 50 attending. The attendance would be
larger and probably more representative, of course, if all or
part of the travel expenses of the conferees eould be financed.
1f this conference were to get out a report which could be used
by the various directors, present and progpective, and uwould be
avallable to NSF if so desired, then the editing, prepavring and
publication of this report would neced to be financed. My letter
at present is just to sce if NSF is likely to be interested in
such a eonference, i1f they would be willing to finance some part
of it and, if so, what we jshould do about it next. I will be
away in Europe during August and the first part of September so
I will not be on hand at the meeting mentioned in the enclosged
notice. If you have questions which should be brought up to
this meeting, I suggest you send them to Professor Frelberger.
In any case, I will be back by Septcmber 10 and would be glad to
heayr your comments then or before I leave on August 5. I think
it 1s about time that This growing field of university computer
research, education and service be discussed in terms of its
broader implicaticns and necessities. I hope you agree.

Yours,

Philip M. Morse

Director
