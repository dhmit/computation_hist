Dear Sir:

~~ I have been authorized to credit your account with an
additional 6 hours of machine time on the Whirlwind 1 computer
for work under problem 273, Analysis of Air Shower Data,

You night be interested to know that since your problem
began you have used 652 minutes of computer time {as of June 10,
1956). If you had been charged at the reguler rate of $250/hour,
the total amount charged to you would heve been $2,715.88.

If you find that you need more time, 1% will be necessary
for you to submit a new request.

 

Sincerely,

 

Â¥. M, Verzuh
