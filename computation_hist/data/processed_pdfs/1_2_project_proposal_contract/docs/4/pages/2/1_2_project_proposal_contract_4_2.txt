Since a research and training prayer: must be closely linked with
other faculty activities, it is proposed that supervision of this part of
the grog-am be undertaken by the recently created Center for Machine Gompua
tation. The interdepartmental Advisory Committee to this Center proﬁdee
a. "broad representation of the various scientific, engineering and trashing
activities nicely to be involved. ‘

The program which IR might wish to support can be divided into
four sections::

1. Research in methods of numerical analysis and the form-
letion of scientiﬁc problems for machine solution, together ui uh support
of training of students in these methods.

2. alpport of the scientific and engineering applications
group previously referred to with Project Whirlwind so as to make the
W computer useiul and available for the above research, and an sid to
the research being carried on by MIT faculty and students.

3. A partial support of the maintenance of the W computer.

4. Research on and investigation of digital computing machine
components.

It is understood that details of the program, which is neces-
sariﬁr evomtionalw in character, will be worked out from time to time with
the Scientific Officer of the ONE.

It is contemplated that $300,000 per annun for a period of at
least two years will be required to get this program under way. Detail
of the budget is as follows:

Item 1 $100,000
Item 2 100,000
Item 3 . 50,000
Item 4 50,000

The detailed budget for each of the items may run apprthely

as follows:
