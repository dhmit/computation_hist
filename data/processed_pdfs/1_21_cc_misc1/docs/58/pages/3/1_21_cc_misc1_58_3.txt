.2 few years ago a machine user had to become familiar with
OiNAry arithmetic and with all the other idiosynerasies of the primary
Bachine operating code, just as the early auto owner had to be familiar
With spark and choke and cluteh, As time goes on it is less and less
necessary for the Occasional user to master all these details in order
to use the machine, even if he has o devise a program for s new problem.
in The first place, many of the more usual calculations will have been
aiready programmed so that, for example, if one wishes to compute a
Bessel function or to apply the chi-squared test for the it of a
formula to a set of data, one need only use %he ready-tested program;
In the secong place;—it is possible to provide a heirarchy of "trans-
lation procedures™ .- assembly and operator programs, ete, —- whereby
the machine itself will translate the desires of Tthe user, ezpressed
in language more familiar %o him, into the specialized "language" of
the basic machine code, This may be termed programming a% the Second
