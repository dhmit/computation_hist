Dear Sir:

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology submits
herewith a revised proposal for extension of the reference contract
to June 30, 1957 at an additional estimated cost of $20,960.00,

We understand that this proposal has been the subject of dlsous-
gions between Professor P. M., Morse of MIT and Mr. A, J. Wise

of ONR=-MIT, Dr. Carl F, Mukenhaupt of ONR-Bogton, and Dr. F. J.
Weyl of ONR--Waghington.,

There follows a summary of expenditures and funds
remaining on the two projects, Whirlwind Operation and Machine
Methods of Computation, which are currently active under the
reference contract:

Project #6345 (Whirlwind Operation) has an unexpended
balance of $97,000 as of November 30, 1955, The current expend-
itures are approximstely $10,000 per month, The average "income"
received for Whirlwind usage is approximately $3,000 per month =-
a net expenditure of $7,000 per month. If it is assumed that the
present level of income ($3,000 per month) is maintalhed during
the nineteen-month period December 1, 1955 to June 30, 1957, a
minimum amount, assuming some tapering off, of $119,000 will be
required during this period.

However, for the purpose of establishing an estimate of
unexpended funds on this project as of June 30, 1956, it is esti-
mated that a higher level of income will exist during the remaining
seven months. This may average something abové $4,000 a month, On
this basis we estimate that $57,000 of the $97,000 mentioned above
will remain unexpended as of June 30, 1956, An mdditional factor
affecting the budget shown on page L 4s the estimated Computer
Income for the one-year period ending June 30, 1957. For this period
only $18,000 in Computer Income has been estimated, Thig is in-
fluenced by two factors: one being an expected tapering=-off of the
use of the Whirlwind machine by other projects, and secondly the
expected beginning of operations under the IBM Type 704 machines,

Project #6915 (Machine Methods of Computation) has an
unexpended balance of $71,000 as of November 30, 1955. The current
expenditures are approximately $7,000 per month, If it is assumed
that the present expénditures remain constant, there will be a balance
of approximately $22,000 on June 30, 1956, In accordance with our
present plang’ for terminating the ONR support of this project on
Juhe 30, 1956, there will be certain additional costs extimated at
$7,000 associated with the closing out of this project including such

items as the preparation of summary reports on the program of
Machine Methods of Computation.

This summary 1s based on estimates prepared by Prof-
egsor P. M. Morse.

Professor Morse further advises that the expected
arrival of an IBM Type 704 Electronic Data Processing Machine a®
MIT about January 1, 1957 will create a definlte need for addl-
tional funds--to finance the conversion of exlsting Whlrlwind
programs to Type 704 programs.

Under the proposed plan submitted herewlth, Project
#6345 (Whirlwind Operation) would terminate on June 30, 1957.
The task order for this period would include the usual Whirlwind
project activities: |

1. Research in methods of numerical analysis and
the formulation of sclentific problema for machlne
solution, together with the training of personnel
in these methods.

2. Support of the Scientific and Engineering Appllca-
tiong Group of Project Whirlwind so as to meke the
computer useful and available for the above-mentioned
research,

In addition, it is proposed that the following task
order arlging in connection with the Type 704 EDPM be included:

3, The development of a suitable interpretive program
and asgsociated coding techniques to permit effectlve
implementation of the Type 704 machine,

It is anticipated that a separate project will be sel
up to handle the Type 704 utilization within the MIT Computation
Center, and a separate request to the ONR for support of this work
wlll be made in the near future, In this respect certain
experienced programmers could be made avalleble for transfer to
this new task as of Januery 1, 1957. Thig entlcipated transfer
hee been taken into sccount in the budget proposed for Project #6345.

The foregoing proposal does not take into congideration
termination costs which may be assoclated with the close out of
this contract and the possible disposition of the Whirlwind Computer.
It is proposed to delay the submittal of any budget for this matter
until such %ime as disposition of the Whirlwind Computer ls
determined,
