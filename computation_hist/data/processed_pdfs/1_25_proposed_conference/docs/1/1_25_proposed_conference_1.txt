Dear Professor Morse:

Dr. Freiberger advises that you are interested to know how
many copies of the report on the Computer Conference have
been sent.

All participants in the Conference received one copy in
August 1960, and in the same month we sent one copy to the
Institutional Members of the American Mathematical Society.

In addition we received requests for 90 copies of the report
. which were serviced, and 130 reprints have been requested and
sent.

Sincerely yours,
