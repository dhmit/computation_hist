The Committee discussed the remainix; cases of ap—
pointments for the following year“ Two appli«1tiors in Mathe—
matics , Bennington and Archer were discussed by the Committee
and were left for Reissner and Lin to make firul decision on
whether or not they were to be appointed. It was also agreed
that the Physics Department would appoint H~létory to take the
place of the earlier appointment of A. Duran, now deceased.

The discussion then turned to the question of the
preliminary courses in Numerical Analysis to be given next
year. Reissner and Lin reported that there was some feeling
that the first—term course should be an undergraduate senior
course rather than a graduate course, This was discussed.

The Committee did not come to any final concltsion, but there
was some feeling the: it might be better to hsva both courses
listed as graduate courses at least at first (particularly since
M351, the suggested prerequisite, is a graduaia course). '
Mr. GPOSch discussed the subject matter of tha couxse he was
interested in giving and suggested that he peidaps should give
the first term and Frofessor Hildebrand the 5£23nd rather than
the reverse" The consensus of opinion of the J)mmittee seamed
counter to this ideal It~was suggested that ‘ovsci and Hilde—
brand get together in the near future to see lxether a combined
schedule of inc one-term courses, with Hildebzand giving the
first course, registered in the Mathematics D()3Ttﬁent, and
Grosch giving the second course, listed in the Electrical

-Engineering Departmeit (at least for the tirsi yes: or so)

could not be worked out. Morse expects to hear frcm Grosoh
and Hildebrand next week.

Professor drones and his assistants in tie Flight
Simulator Project discussed the development 01 their project
and indicated that iley were anxious that the equipment involved
be made available fun educational and general research activitie
of the Institute. rse outlined the activities of the Committo .
indicated that it a possible that some of tie assistentship

‘ oy the Committee might be useful in support
