Memorandum to Professor G. S. Brown

Subject: Allocation of time

I would like to request that as much of my
time be allocated to the Electrical Engineering
Department as possible. In particular, I would
appreciate any possible teaching assignment in
the eore curriculum, preferably 6.02, 6.03, or
6.05 or the first courses in Information Theory or
the Statistiecal Theory of Communication. In the
latter two instances, I would prefer a semester's
warning to enable me to audif the courses.

The work at the Computation Center during the
last few years has tended to be constricted to a
fairly narrow specialty and I would appreclate the
opportunity to use and improve a somewhat broader
range of skills.

Sincerely yours,

Dean N. Arden
Assistant Professor of
Electrical Engineering
