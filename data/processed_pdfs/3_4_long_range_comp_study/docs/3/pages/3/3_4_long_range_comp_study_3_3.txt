VARIABLE BZUNDS MEMORY PROTECTION
— P — T — s AV ""‘""M

Two prcristers are provided, designated the Lower and

Uppe- fegisters. When in the protection mode, any ¢Py

c-°rated mewory address, including "1" cycles, 1s compared
-gainst these two registers. The comparison is made after
relocation, if any. If the address is less than the CORn=
tents of the lowep register or greater than the contents
of the Upper reginster, a trap is generated, storing the
actual (unrelocated) value of the instruction counter
in location 32 ang transferring control to location 33,
The execution of the instruction causing the trap is
blocked. 1In addition, execution of any trap will take
the CPU out of both the protectlon and relocation mode,
leaving the contents of the registers unchanged .,

Two instructiong are provided:

1) Set Protection Mode ¥

Execution of this instruction will place bits 3-9

and 21-27 of Y into the Upper and Lower register,
respectively. In addition, the CPU is placed in the
protection mode. The protect mode, however, does not
become effective until after the instruetion following
Che SPM has been executed., In addition, no I/0 traps
13y occur between the SPM and the instruction following.*
The instruction is indexable and indirectly addressable.

2) Store Protection Indicators Y

Execution of this instruction will place the contents

of the Upper and Lower Registers in positions 5=0 and
21-27 of ¥, respectively. If in the Protection Mode,

a2 "1" will be stored in position 2 of Y. The instruction
18 indexable and indirectly addreszzable.

Tragg ng

When in the protection mode, execution of the following
instructions will cause a trap:
