COMMITTEE ON MACHINE METHODS OF COMPUTATION

Minutes of the Eighth Meeting
April 7, 1954

Persons Present: C. W. Adams, S. H. Caldwell, H. Feshbach,
J. W. Forrester, J. A. Hrones, C. C. Lin,
P. M. Morse, W. W. Seifert, F. M. Verzuh

Morse reported that Euwema2 had declined the RA
offer and that Garwin had been awarded an NSF fellowship;
Tublis, Sartori and Uretsky had accepted; Glendenning had
refused and Winkel had not been heard from. The Physics
Department has no other recommendations now.

Lin reported that K. Ralston has accepted, Reich is
going elsewhere and that McIlroy is now recommended as an addi-
tional RA. The Committee approved. Lin also brought up the
application of Dr. Bayard Rankin from the University of Cali-
fornia as a possible post-doctoral fellow. The Committee de-
cided that if there 1s someone of the Mathematics faculty who
is interested enough in Rankin's main line of activity to wish
to supervise his work, an appointment would be appropriate.

Caldwell recommended that Hoy be continued in his
appointment next year. This was approved; D. A. Huffman to be
his supervisor. Morse reported that Professor Hurley had
recommended the continuation of Vozoff, which was also approved.
Hrones sald the Mechanical Engineering Department may have a
recommendation next time. Adams indicated there may be recommen-
dations from the Sloan School for a man to work on some appli-
cations of machines to industrial practice.

Adame also Indicated that there were possible MS
thesis problems for Math students who were interested. He and
Verzuh, Lin and Hildebrand will discuss this and report back
next time.

The next meeting will be at 3:00 p.m., Wednesday,

April 28.
