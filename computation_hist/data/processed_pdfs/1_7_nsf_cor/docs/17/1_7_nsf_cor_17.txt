ENCLOSURE B

Excerpts from Original Proposal for Funds
(modified to bring it up to date)

Name and Addv es of Institution:

 

Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge 39, Mass.

Title of Preposed Research;
Research on Digital Computer Operation and Utilization

Investigation into the patterns of operation of electronic
digital computers and the methods whereby they can be used in
mathematical and experimental research; including studies of
numerical analysis and machine programming methods, investigation
of the possibilities of the complete mechanization of the sequence
of recording, processing, analysis and presentation of experi-
mental data and the working out of such specific applications of
machine techniques to problems in science, engineering, and
administration as will clarify the basic seasotnh and suggest new
points of View.

Desired Starting Date: September 1, 1956.

Time Period: Three years, with a reassessment during the fall of
1959 to determine whether further support is advisable.

Proposed Research - Background Information:

We are organizing what should be one of the most fruitful
centers for research related to the use of electronic computers,
in this country. IBM is contributing one of its 704 machines,
maintained and equipped with appropriate auxiliary equipment.

IBM and MIT are providing the building, part of the new Compton
Laboratory, and MIT is contributing some of the staff from its
departments of mathematics, electrical engineering, physics, and
industrial management. The machine will be available, 35 or more
hours a week, free of machine time charge, to MIT staff_and
students for non-classified and non-routine research. MIT

research in the Center will be coordinated by the Institute
Machine Computation Committee.

In addition, the Center will be available, up to 35 hours
a week, on the same basis, to other colleges in New England.
Already 23 institutions have indicated their interest in parti-
cipating and have appointed faculty members to be their Insti-
tutional Representative. These representatives will coordinate
the research done on the machine by students and staff of their
institution. IBM is providing some funds for stipends for

graduate students who wish to learn machine use by helping with
some of this research.

In this atmosphere and with these facilities, there is an
unparalleled opportunity to do important and basic research in
all phases of the use of digital computers in science, engineering,
and business. A central research group, supervised by faculty
members and staffed by workers picked from the graduate students
of NET and other colleges, working closely with persons from the
other colleges, will help coordinate the work of the Center and
will carry on research of their own in machine logic, in tech-

‘niques of machine computation, and in specificﬁapplications of

machine operation to experimental and theoretical problems, thus

yappreciably broadening the range of applicability of computers

in the physical and social sciences and in engineering.

It is appropriate for government agencies to help support

the research of this central research group. The group's work a

will, in part, provide an expanding basis of knowledge of numbri—
cal analysis and programming techniques, which can be used by the
other participants at the Center and will, in part, break ground
in new fields of mathematical logic and methods of data processing
which will be needed in the application of digital computers to
new tasks.

Most of the senior staff for such a research group is
already assembled at the Institute. Part of it is the group which
developed Whirlwind I programming; others are in various depart-
ments of the Institute. From time to time, some of the staff of
the participating colleges will join it for a semester or a year,
on leave from their institution, to work full time at the Center.

IBM and the Institute will contribute about a half million
dollars a year to provide the equipment, building, maintenance and
operating staff of the Center. We believe that a contribution of
about $120,000 a year will support the activities of the central
research group, which will energize and take the lead in the
research carried on at the Computation Center by students and
staff of MIT and the particppating colleges. We list later in
this proposal some of the specific research projects we are pre-
pared to start on. other projects will develop naturally from
these and from the problems encountered by the other workers at
the Computation Center.

Part of these additional funds can be obtained from some
of the research projects which will use the facilities of the
Center. 'Although the use of the machine itself will not be
chargeable, most users will need advice from the Center staff as
to preparing their programs, will need help in detailed coding
and will prefer to have our staff carry out many of the actual
runs on the computer. This will add to the duties of the staff,
and part of the_additional cost will be charged to those projects
which can afford this extra service. Those students and faculty
members who cannot afford to pay for this help will be able to
use the machine, but will be expected to do their own coding,

card-punching, testing and running of their problems. We
estimate $59,600 a year can come from payments from other

rejects for the programming service described, leaving about
$7tiﬁeﬁ a year tc'be obtained from other sources.

the Rockefeller Foundation has granted the computation
Center about $100,000 for three years, Beginning July 1, 1957,
for the support of a staff to investigate applications of
digital computers in the social sciences. Thus only about
$35 $90 a year is needed to complete the support or the Center
staff, enough to support that part of the staff concentrating on
the physical science aspects of the activity. In order to get
our plans ﬁell under way, this grant should be continued for
about three years (as with the Rockefeller grant), after which
the program should be re-evaluated to determine needs beyond
that date.

Proposed Research - Possible Initial Directions of Investigation

1. Investigation of Structure and Syntax of input languages;
the possibilities of coding directly in mathematical, logical or
business language.

2. Development of routines capable of translating from
algebraic notation to computer code and vice versa, including

possibly automatic selection of numerical techniques and auto—
matic error analysis.

3. Development of numerical analytic techniques particu-
larly suitable for use by digital computers; such as more
general expansions, truncated Chebyshev polynomial sums for
simulating standard functions by a common block of instructions
but small separate blocks of coefficients and cycle counters and
methods of automatic determination of best grid spacing, by trial
plus Richardson extrapolation or other means.

4. Investigation of Monte Carlo techniques for large
problems.

5. Extension and/or imppovement of present techniques for
communication between machine and operator and for the more

flexible control of machine operation, including possible
improvements in input—output equipment.

'6. Experimental analysis and control using data trans—
mitted directly between computer and experiment.

7. Investigation of microgrogramming and other methods for
increasing the flexibility of computer design. The postibility
of inclusion of a very flexible control unit in a large—scale
computer which would permit ready alteration of an order code.


Extension of NSF GE9H0 Page 7

8. Investigation of techniques for intercommunication
between computers, including the possibility of cycles different
in length or kind running simultaneously with frequent comparison,
e.g.£ several singie-accumulator computers with common memory,and
the behavior of a computer with multiple accumulators. Some of
these properties can be simulated on a 70#\by utilization of
adiitionai deﬁne and magnetic core banks.

9. computer estimation of problem time: In linear problems,
estimations of bounds of certain functionals, - d thence conver-
gence criteria for terminating iteration, or s ‘tching to a
different iteration.

Facilities:

 

The MIT Computation Center will have a Type 704 lectronic ‘
Data Processing Machine with the following machine com lement: i
, 12 magnetic tape units, 2 magnetic core storage units c taining i
a total of 8,000 words, 1 magnetic drum unit containing
words of storage,'the usual on—line punched card reader.
betic printer, and punched card.recorder as well as the 3
magnetic-tape—controlled printer, magnetic-tape-controlled rd
punch, and punched card-to—magnetic tape converter, respecti 1y.
In addition to the 70k there will be 10 auxiliary punched ca
machines including card punches, collators, sorters, reproduce
b interpreters, and the Type 40; Accounting Machine. The aggrega
V machine rental, in excess of 50,000 per month, will be donated
by IBM.

   
     

 

The Type 704 EDPM unit is one of the fastest large-scale ;
commercial computers available today. Sincd the MIT installation ,
will be but one of many in the field, techniques, programs, and
numerical procedures developed for this machine will be of use
to others having access to 704 equipment.
