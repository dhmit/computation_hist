Dear Mr. Buchanan:

I enclose an applieation for a grant of 536 000 a year
- for three years to help support a research staff, so that the
Computation Center at MIT can explore new ways whereby high-speed
computing equipment can be utilized in social science. Directions
for initial research are indicated, though details cannot be given
before work is started. A tentative budget and description of the
computing equipment are appended, together with an outline of the
arrangements for cther New England colleges to participate in use
of the equipment.

I have talked this zpplication over with Dr. Carl F; Floe,
Asslstant Chancellor of MIT, and it has his approval. Please let |
me know if you wish more information. |

Sincerely yours,
