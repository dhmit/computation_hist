Dear Dr. Locke:

in getting an opinion of a manuscript which we received for publication,
and which I am enclosing herewit . This book has been revised once, but
I do not seem to have any reading opinion on it. I shall be indebted to

you if you would put it in the hands of a person you think most competent
to give a critical review of this proposed monograph.

 

I hesitate to trouble you,but I am taking the liberty of imposing
on you in this instance.

Thank you for any suggestions you may have.

Sincerely yours,

3; 9. {iii new
