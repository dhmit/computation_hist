THE RIEMANN FUNCTION FOR *u/dxdy + H(x + y)u = 0

By Harvey Conn

1. Introduction. Some interesting hyperbolic differential equations can be
represented in the form

(1) 9°u/0x 9y + H(x + y)u = 0.

An instance of (1) as the wave equation in space was first considered by Euler
[5; 480-81]. Instances of this equation in the field of differential geometry
(Laplace) are given in Darboux [3; 52], and instances in the field of compressible
hydrodynamics were considered by Riemann [6; 173] for linear flows and by A.
Steichen (see Ackaret [1; 317]) for plane flows.

We shall concern ourselves entirely with the evaluation of the Riemann
Junction of (1), by means of which Riemann showed how to solve (1) for given
boundary conditions. The Riemann function, despite its crucial importance,

seems to have been found in closed form only in the special cases H(r) = —\
and H(r) = —A(\ + 1)/7°, X constant. Moreover these cases are just those

solved by Riemann, who, in turn, has even been anticipated to some extent by
Euler [4]! Undoubtedly, the Picard iteration process and its existence proof
for the Riemann function in general, drew attention away from the evaluation
of this function. Nevertheless, the fact that the Riemann function has been
evaluated only for these two simple cases restricts the number of physical
situations to which equation (1) can correspond and still remain simple enough
to permit solution in closed form by use of a Riemann function.

It will therefore be our purpose to consider the possibility of finding the
Riemann function for a greater variety of functions H(r). The methods will
be twofold. First of all we shall use a specialized artifice to obtain the
Riemann function in closed form for a few types of H(r), namely H(r) =
—AA + Du’/sinh® p(r + ») (\, u, » constant), and some of its limiting cases,
H(r) = —\exp ur, —A(\ + 1)/7°, and —\. Then we shall consider a certain
Fourier integral expression for the Riemann function of (1) with arbitrary H(r).
This latter expression is due to Riemann, who derived it in a heuwristic manner.
We shall also indicate a rigorous proof of Riemann’s expression, since this long-
neglected expression is of potential importance with the further development of
analysis.

2. Some properties of the Riemann function. For later reference we shall
summarize some existence and uniqueness theorems as obtained through the
Picard iteration process (see Courant-Hilbert [2; 317-322]). For equation (1),
