Dear Dr. Jorgensen:

- It is with a great deal of pleasure that I enclose our check
for $1,515.00 representing the first semester portion of the stipends
for the 1BM Research Associates and Assistant recently appointed for
the 1959-60 school year in connection with the M.I.T. Computation
Center. A detailed description of the appointments is attached.

The increasing use of the IBM 704 Computer at M.1.T. by
the New England colleges both as an educational device and a research
tool has been very encouraging to IBM, and we are delighted that the

~ University of Connecticut is having an active part in it as represented

by these research appointments.

â€œUbe.
