Thus far. management education and
management practice have been com—
partmentalized into such classic
SublelSIOl’iS as finance. marketing. pro—
duction, and accounting. However, the
major problems of the industrial manager
arise not so much from the separate
components of the company as from how
these interact to produce instability in
prices, production, employment, and
profits. Building on the development of
electronic computers, on military advances
in understanding deCIsion-making and in
using simulation to solve complex sys»
tems, and on twenty years of research in
feedback control systems, we may now
develop new ways to analyze the indus
trial enterprise. Management is on the
verge of a major breakthrough in under,
standing how industrial company success
depends on the interaction between
flows of information (including policies
and decisions). materials, money, man-
power, and capital equipment. To help
prowde a basis from which to understand
the forces causing Industrial fluctuation,
growth, stability, and decline, the Masr
sachusetts lnstitute of Technology
School of Industrial Management Will
offer a tworweek Special Summer
Program on Industrial Dynamics from
Monday. August 17, through Friday,
August 28, 1959,

 

outline of Program

This Special Summer Program will
describe new methods of analyzing how
organizational structure, policies, decision
criteria, information distortion, and time
lags in information and material flow
may affect the course of industrial
growth, cause fluctuation in sales,
accentuate seasonal tendencies, and
amplify external economic conditions,
Models of industrial company operation
will be formulated for digital computer

solution.
This Special Summer Program results

uate teaching in the dynamics of ecoe
nomic systems, company functions, and
corporate policies, and in programming
computers for industrialrdynamic ana|y~
ses, For a more complete description of
this approach and its results, see "Indus-
trial Dynamics—7A Major Breakthrough
for Decision-Makers” by Professor Jay
W. Forrester in the July-August, 1958,
issue of The Harvard Business Review,

This will be an intensive session devoted
to method, rather than a descriptive sur-
vey course. It is intended primarily for the
executive. to give him sufficient under-
standing to judge the usefulness of the
approach for his own company, The
management science specialist or the
management school faculty member will
find that the Program provides a baSlS
for further work; but it is not sufficient
preparation for immediate use of this new
approach to management problems.

Tuition for the twosweek Program will be

of admissmn. Academic credit will not be
offered Exercises will be held from 9 to
12 and 2 to 5, Mondays through Fridays.

The Program can accept only a limited
number of participants. Applicants must
have a wide interest in and experience
with the problems of the company as a
whole and the interaction of the separate
industrial functions of research, engi-
neering, production, marketing, and
finance. Preference Will be given to those
who have had mathematics (through dif-
ferential equations), an introduction to
digital computer programming, and pracr
tical or educational contact With feed;
back control systems. Applications should
show industrial experience and the
extent of training in mathematics, digital
computation, and feedback control.

Staff

This Program is under the direction of
Dr. Jay W. Forrester, Professor of Indus-
trial Management The staff will include
John L, Enos. Assistant Professor, and
other members of the industrial
dynamics group of the M.|.T. School

of Industrial Management.
