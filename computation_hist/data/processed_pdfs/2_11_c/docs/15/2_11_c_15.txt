Dear Mr. “Cramery TET Tn
° x : Ps Er EC TPIT TEI EE re rae, ER -

Thank you for your letter of June 25 wherein you
of further details on the coding course Which will
be given here at M.I.T. this August.

Inasmuch as you already have considerable familiarity
with the material which will be taught, it hardly seems
necessary that you disrupt your summer plans to attend the
course. The purpose of the course is to make it easier for
persons to absorb rapidly the large amount of material which

is necessary for present day computers to be used effectively.
It appears to me that you have a dy essentially done this
in the two courses which you Pe taken this last year at

Harvard.

Sometime after the veginning ef your appointment at
your convenience you are expected to come to the Center and
get acquainted. I will be looking forward to meeting you

at that time. If you have any other questions concerning
your assistantship, please do not hesitate to write.

aR re ly,

F, J. Corbato
