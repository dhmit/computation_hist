The purpose of this two-day work session was to clarify the
dimensions on the steel plates in the floor of the MIT 704 Calculator Room
(26-156). In addition, the special engineering representatives Irom Poughkeepsie
were available to clarify the previously-submitted drawings (IBM #680828-10, 20,
30, 40, and 50) concerning the duct connections to the following six machines:

1) 704 Central Processing Unit (3 duct connections),

2) 733 Magnetic Dru (1 duct connection),

3) 736 Power Unit (3 duct connections),

4) 737 Magnetic CORE Unit (2 duct comnections), |
5) 737 Magnetic CORE Unit (2 duct connections), |
G6) 741 Power Unit (3 duct connections).

The principal source of confusion arose as a result of the fact that |
all of the existing Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill drawings (R-435, R-46, A-23,
ete.) have incorrectly-scaled information regarding the location of holes in
the steel plates as well as the location of underfloor duct openings. After i
many hours of fruitless labor, it was decided to sbhandon using Skidmore, Owings
and Merrill drawings end proceed with "on-spot” field measurements and exect

site locations.

Naturally this 1s a moot regrefable situation, and ore which
could have been avoided had properly-scaled drawings been prepared by the |

grchitect. Apparently one source of common (difficulty is the confusion

Associsted Probleas oa Dust Connected Machines

Reference vas made to the Poughkeepsie memo by Eatthews dated
December 10 for specifications for "wind sketeh circuit” reguirements for the
HIT installstion. It was agreed that NIT would provide two #14 wires from the
"gind sketch" to the hase of the Type 747 Power Distribution tnit (leaving a
4' lgader available for commnectiona to the underfloor Cannon plug socket which
will be provided by the IN Corporatiom.

The specifications for the humidity control (Minneapolis-Homneywell
152P) and asscciated relay equipment were examined and discussed. It was
agreed that the mmidity and temperature control recording equipment would be -
maintained on the West side of Column A-3. The signal indicating light will

Higcellenecous Items on ths Agendas

Since the special engineering group, sales department, and the
various contracters were available during this meeting, many miscellansous
items were considered. For example:

1. Arrangements were made to install a duct from the power panel in the
704 room underneath the steel plates which would permit the
installation of the five conductor power cables betwesn the power
panel and the Typs 741 Power Distribution Unit. Because of the
cramped location, it was agreed that a duct of dimension §" x 7"
might be installed ,°

 

2, It was vecommended that a 115v outlet be installed on the North
side of Column A-2 to be used with the Type 62-68 Data Receiver,

3. Trevato recommended that two (2) layers of masonite material be
provided during the machine installation period =-- to protect
the rubber flooring from machine marking,

4, Travato indicated that IBM customer engineers would arrive at
the MIT 704 site two weeks prioy to machine delivery to install
the underfloor cables.

6. It was suggested that a 1/4" steel plete caster be provided for

all casters on the heavy machines in tho 704 area. Those castors
will be cut by the MIT shop.

The shove "straight line" measurements do not include lengths of cable Which
will be provided at either end of the cable ~ distance riging up rom the
subfloor to the actual machine connection above the floor. Travato will check
the above distances to insure that correct cable lengths will be obtsined.
Specifically, the ceble 759-737RD is critical since its maximm "electrical"
langth cannot exceed 35°.

Conclusion

This meeting was most successful and the wholehearted coarporation
of Messrs. DiBenedetto, Winme, Travato, Collins, and many of the subcontractors
is greatly sppreciatsed. A drawing will ® prepared which indicates the actual

location of the duct openings im the steel ficor in ander that corrected drawings
will be available for future use.

Hr. Collins agreed to make necessary osalid prints of the "om spot"
sbotches for the duet eennected machines which were prepared during this two-
dey sossion. These will be gent to IRM, Skidmore, Owings and Moxrill, ete.,
for futurs inclusion im swccesding work,
