Dear Professor Morse:

We have just heard from Mr. Svein Nordbotten of Oslo,
who was awarded one of our fellowships and who planned to
work at your Center at MIT, that he has contracted tuberculosis
and will be hospitalized for some time. Perhaps he will have
written you directly.

I enjoyed our brief conversation in Cambridge in May
and shall look forward to hearing the report of the Center
which you spoke of letting us have.

Yours very truly,

éwew

 

Professor Philip Mecord Morse
