TRIP REPORT

TC: SR Dr. M. A. Shader | FROM: Cambridge MIT CC
PLACE VISITED: Boston College | |
PERSONS SEEN: Rev. W. GC. Guindon DATE: December 12, 1957

Prof. Guindon told me that he was quite interested in the proposal made

at the December 6 meeting of all the Institutional Representatives. This

was a proposal to hold practical training cour ses on the 704 for ali the
users of the Computation Center who need it. He said that weekly seminars
were being held now at Boston College. Most of the discussion is carried

on by Mr. Van Tassel and Mr. Dougherty. These seminars are also attended
by Prof. Guindon and Prof. White and several graduate students. He does
think, however, that a practical training cour se given by MIT staff during

the afterncons on some mutually agreeable schedule would be highly beneficial
to the anticipated users of the Center at Boston College and other New
England colleges. |
