Dear prof., Perlils,

In January I have sent you a letter concerning your oRfer
about the exchange of visits between Computing Centre of the
Academy of Sciences and Carnegie Teche

In my letter I expressed my gratitude and asked you for a
formal ipvitation.

But untiÂ¥ now I haven't received an answer from YOuUe

Excuse me, please, for my remembering but I would wish 1o
know your decision as soon as possible because I have to coordinate
this visit with some other trips. Don't hesitate to inform me 1if
you have some difficulties concerning the realization of your
intention, |

I also wish to advise you that I have safely received all
three books for which I convey my thanks.

Sincerely yours,
