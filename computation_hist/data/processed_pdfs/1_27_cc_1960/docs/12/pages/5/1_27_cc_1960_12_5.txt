these objectives. For the present, it appears that any one
of a number of typewriter types with additional pushbuttons
for special purposes will suffice. These are for the most
part presently available.

(3) Definition of the overall system: Analysis is being
carried out to determine the necessary configuration of the
overall system., This work is still largely only in qualita—
tive terms.

(A) Formulation of the overall programming system: In
this area, with the exception of small pieces of the problem,
such as the Linking Loader and the FMIS system, very little
has been done. It is expected that a much greater rate of
progress will become available as the system configuration,

manpower, and funding are more firmly established.
