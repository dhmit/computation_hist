Thank you for your letter which Professor
Harte, as Director or the Computation Center, has forwarded
_to me. I would like very much to talk to you about the
subject of automatic programming and would particularly
like to have any material that you have available on
senoral concepte of information retrieval.

We have a seminar at the present time
conducted by Professor John McCarthy of Dartmouth, who
in Visiting M.I.T. this year, on the subject of automatic
programming. Reproductions of these lectures are being
