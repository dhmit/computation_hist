Dear Professor Morse,

I am at the moment, preparing a thesis on "Machine
Interference" for my Master Degree at the University of
London.

I have read a great deal of literature dealing with
the research done in this field in Great Britain, U.S.A,
France, and many other countries.

It has been suggested to me by Dr. D.R. Cox of
Birkbeok College to-oontactÂ«you in~the hope that you*
will be able to assist me with this problem and perhaps
give me advice on any literature which may have been
published by the institute,or any practical case study
that may have been done in the college or elsewhere.

With very many thanks,

Yours sincerely,

C J. Levy.
