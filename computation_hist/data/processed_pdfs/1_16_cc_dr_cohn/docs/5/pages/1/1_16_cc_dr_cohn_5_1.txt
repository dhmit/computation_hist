TWO NEW NON-LINEARIZED CONICAL FLOWS*

1. Introduction. A steady compressible non-viscous flow is conical if it contains a
vertex P, such that on every half line through P the velocity components, pressure,
density, and entropy are constant. Various linearized conical flows have been discussed
by numerous authors. However, only three examples of non-linearized conical potential
flow fields are known to exist mathematically: Prandtl-Meyer flow around an edge [4]'
with or without sweep; Taylor-Maccoll flow about a non-yawing circular cone [5]; and
an axisymmetric flow through a convergent nozzle discussed by Busemann [1]. In this
paper the construction of two new examples will be considered. Both contain two regions
of swept Prandtl-Meyer flow. In the first, the boundary has been chosen to prevent
them from interacting, and the hodograph is one-dimensional. From it can be obtained
a flow, with attached plane shock, over an object resembling an airplane with a swept-
forward wing of positive dihedral and with a thick fin. In the second, the boundary has
been chosen to permit interaction and the hodograph is two-dimensional. It was studied
originally in the hodograph space by one of the authors [2]. In the present treatment, the
need to consider possible difficulties in constructing the flow field from a knowledge of
the hodograph has been avoided by confining the discussion to the physical space. It
should also be remarked that in both examples the second order partial dlfferentlal
equation for conical potential flow is of mixed type.

A pair of these examples could conceivably be used to study a particular, atypical
case of wing-body interference. Numerical results can easily be calculated, if necessary,
with the aid of a characteristics table and by means of standard techniques for numerical
integration of ordinary differential equations and numerical solution of characteristic
initial value problems for second order hyperbolic partial differential equations in two
independent variables.

2. Fundamental Ideas. The velocity potential function of a steady irrotational
non-viscous isentropic flow satisfies

(@*6;; — wu;)d%/0x; 0x; = 0 (2.1)
where z; (7 = 1, 2, 3) are rectangular coordinates,
u; = dp/0x; (2.2)
is the velocity component parallel to the z;-axis in units of the maximum speed of flow,
= 1/2(y — 1)1 — uu) = 1/2(y — DA — ¢) (2.3)

is the square of the velocity of sound, Kronecker’s delta é,, = 1(0) if 7 = (%) j, and the
convention has been adopted that repeated indices imply summation over their range.
If ¢* = wwu; > a’, the flow is supersonic, and there exist real characteristic surfaces,
which are envelopes of the Mach cones
