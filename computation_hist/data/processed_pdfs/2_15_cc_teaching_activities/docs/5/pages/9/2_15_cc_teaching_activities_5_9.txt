involving volume 01' data, rate of
information flow, need for rearrangement of computational

procedure, study of the effects or errors, breakdown, and
interruptions, and finally a consideration of problem areas
of interest to management to provide better overall control.

XVII. Solution of a Payroll Problen on the 650 Calculator

A basic 650 program was prepared tor a hypothetical
payroll involving 200 employees. The study included a

day. the usual items such as, regular pay, over-tine pay, bond
deduction, hospitalization, income tax, union dues, credit

union, Continuity Chest and other miscellaneous deductions, were
included.

XVIII. Hitchcock's Kethcd for Evaluating the Roots of a Polynomial__

A basic 656 program was prepared for evaluating the roots
of a polynolisl. Particular emphasis was given to a con-
sideration of polynonials which cannot be handled by this method.

XIX. Study of Series-Parallel Switching Functions

A basic 650 program was prepared for evaluating the
switching functions or six or fewer variables. The program
enployed is a Iodincation of the McCluskey Quins reduction
procedure by means of which the preliminary inplicants and
minimum sun toms of the switching functions were obtained.
The solutions of 86 different problems were performed during
the course or this study.

XX. Solution of Spheriodal Antennae Equation Using the 650

A NOPI progra- was prepared for the solution of. this
equation using Iiilno's predictor-corrector formulae.

XXL 650 Solution of the Production Scheduling; Problem

A HITSS program was prepared for the solution of this
problem which determined production curves which minimize costs
for a single arbitrary sales forecast. Graphical results were
obtained which related the sensitivity of the solutions for
various system parameters using a quadratic production cost
function.
