Dear Prof. Hartreet

I am glad to hear that you are coming here this
summer and I hope that you can spend some time at our new
Computation Center. Unfortunately, I may be away myself
during the month of July but I will be back August 1. How-
ever, many of the Computation Center
in July and I am sure will be glad to show you the place
and let you do as much work as you care to. We are in the

new Compton Laboratories, not too far away from Professor
Slater's office, where I imagine you will have your main
headquarters. However, if you would like to spend some
time at the Center, I am sure we can arrange space for you.

I do not know when you intend being back at
Cavendish. I expect to attend a conference on operations
research at Oxford the week of September 2, If you are
back home the previous week I might arrange to fly over
earliér and spend, say, Friday and Saturday, August 30 and
31, visiting you there. We can probably make detalled plans
in August when I get back, if you are still here then. How-
ever, if you do not expect to be back home by the end of
August I would appreciate your letting me know so that I
can make other plans.
