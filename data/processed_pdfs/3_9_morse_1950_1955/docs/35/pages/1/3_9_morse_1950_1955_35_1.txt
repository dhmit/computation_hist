Proposed Title: The Role of Anslog Computers in Industry.

A discussion of the basic principles of analog computers will be
given with particular emphasis on the various types of differential
anelyzers. In addition, various types of speoisl-purpose analog computers
such a8 the simunltanecus equation machines, correlators, ete. will be men-
tioned. Pertiment physiocal characteristics and limitetions, e.g. speed of
operation, probable agecuracy, ete. will be covered. & disouszion will be
given of some of the types of problems whlch have been solved on the
pifferential Anelyzer - - particularly those frequently encountered in
industry. Finally, mention will be made of snalog-digital machines and
some of their applicstions.

Detailed discus:zion of the mctual computer components and the method
of setting problems upon the Anslyzer will be reserved for the lnspection
