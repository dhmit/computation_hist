effective application,

 

 

The following outline summarizes the functional

 

 

capabilities which will be covered on each machine:

 

Key Punch: Coding, key punching, printing, verifying,

 

 

and the interpretation of data into punched

 

cards.

 

 

Sorter: Card counting, numeric and alphabetic sorting.

 

 

 

Collator: Matching, merging, selection and comparison.

 

Reproducer: Gang punching, summary punching, reproducing

 

 

 

and comparison,

 

 

 

 

Tabulator: Listing, group indication, printing, addi-
tion, subtraction, selection and automatic
contrel,

Calculators: +, =, x, =, programming, selection,
shifting operations by scltion of the same
