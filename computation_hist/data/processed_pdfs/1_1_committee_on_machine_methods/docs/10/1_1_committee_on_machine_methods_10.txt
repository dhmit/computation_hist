Kopal reported that the situation was not yet clear about
Verzuh or Salzer, The Committee felt that Verzuh should take
M39 this term, but Verzuh has not yet gotten clear enough of his
various duties to be able to carry this and teach his course and
take M39 and do his thesis. Nevertheless the Committee felt it.
was better for him to Sign up for M39 now and to work toward a
lightening of his duties 3 if this turns outta be impossible, to
cancel M39 latte:-O It appears only to wait action by Stratton to
clear the matter up., In Salxer‘s case his supervisory oomittee
is meeting today and should clear up his questions.

Kopal indicated that Professor Gardner would appreciate
hearing from the Committee as to how he is to advise Electrical
Engineering men in this field what to take for their miners.
Morse will try to answer this»

Kopal also suggested that Professor Lighthill was giving a
talk here on Friday afternoon, that our seminar could attend
this talk.
