Dear Prof, Morse:

I am making a visit to several Eastern universities for
the purpose of recruiting staff for our Mathematics Department
and our Computer Laboratory. I am also interested in discussing
the program for the proposed meeting of university computing
people under sponsorship of NSF, I expect to be in Boston all day
on Friday, February 19, and I would like to plan to visit with you
to discuss these matters, You may remember that I talked with
you informally about the possibility of our getting a visiting pro-
fessor from MIT who is actively engaged in research on computer
applications and who might be able to come under the sponaorship
of Ford Foundation, I also talked to you about the serious problem
that we are having in trying to locate a permanent director for our
new computation center,

Since I will be leaving here on February 10, there may not
be time for an exchange of letters from you, but if at all possible
I hope to hear that you will be able to see me on the 19th, If I do
not hear from you before I leave, I will call you from Washington
or New York early the week of the 15th,

\\ /\/C [ Yours sincerely,
