These claims were:

1. In a stringless necklace, a chain comprising
a plurality of at least four bead members fgrmed
of resilient synthetic plastic material having tl}e
resilient properties of polyethylene, each pair
of adjacent bead members being connec.ted to
each other by a ball and socket joint, a fu'st. of
each pair of said adjacent bead members having
an extension in the form of a neck extending from
a surface thereof facing the other adjacent bead
member, said neck having a head adjacent the
outer end thereof, the facing surface of said otl}er
adjacent bead member having a socket opening
for detachably receiving and retaining the head
of the first bead member, said socket opening
including a mouth which is of smaller cross
sectional area than the interior portion of said
socket opening, said head being larger in cross
sectional area than the mouth of said socket
opening whereby such head will not ordinarily
pass through the mouth of a socket opening but
due to the resilience of said plastic material
may be forced therethrough with a snap action
to provide a relatively secure but easily dis-
connected junction between adjacent beads, said
head being smaller than the interior portion of
said socket opening and the neck on said bead
member in the region adjacent the head being
smaller in cross sectional area than said mouth
whereby to provide for freedom of play of the
neck in the socket opening and flexibility in the
junction between each pair of adjacent bead mem-
bers.

2. In astringless necklace, a chain comprising
a plurality of at least four bead members formed
of resilient synthetic plastic material having the
resilient properties of polyethylene, each pair of
adjacent bead members being connected to each
other by a ball and socket joint, a first of each
pair of said adjacent bead members having an
extension in the form of a neck extending from a
surface thereof facing the other adjacent bead
member, said neck having a head adjacent the
outer end thereof, the facing surface of said
other adjacent bead member having a socket
opening for detachably receiving and retaining
the head of the first bead member, said socket
opening including a mouth which is of smaller
cross-sectional area than the interior portion
of said socket opening, said head beinglarger in
cross sectional area than he mouth of the said
socket opening whereby such head will not
ordinarily pass through the mouth of a socket

face of said other adjacent bead member having
a socket opening for detachably receiving and re-
taining the head of the first bead member, said
socket opening including a mouth which is of
smaller cross sectional area than the interior
portion of said socket opening, said head being
larger in cross sectional area than the mouth of
said socket opening whereby such head will not
ordinarily pass through the mouth of a socket
opening but due to the resilience of said plastic
material may be forced therethrough with a
snap action to provide a relatively secure but
easily disconnected junction between adjacent
beads, said head being smaller than the interior
portion of said socket opening and the neck on
said bead member in the region adjacent the head
being smaller in cross sectional area than said

mouth whereby to provide for freedom of play

of the neck in the socket opening and flexibility
in the junction between each pair of adjacent bead

members said beads being formed of polyethyl-
ene.

4. In astringless necklace, a chain comprising
a plurality of at least four bead members formed
of resilient synthetic plastic material having the
resilient properties of polyethylene, each pair of
adjacent bead members being connected to each
other by a ball and socket joint, a first of each
pair of said adjacent bead members having an
extension in the form of a neck extending from a
surface thereof facing the other adjacent bead

other adjacent bead member having a socket

Since this application was to become a
publication, it was necessary for the ex-
aminer to determine where, in his opin-
ion, the disclosures of this patent would
be helpful to future searchers. The pat-
ent was issued in the Ornamental Form
subclass along with exhibits 2 and 3 and a
copy was placed in each of the subclasses
which provides for molded plastic.articles,
reptile figure toys, chain type joints, bead
chains, and chain-type bracelets. These
subclasses were chosen because the ex-
aminer considered the joint or the con-
catenation features of this new referer}ce
would be pertinent in future_ sparghes in-
volving the features classified in these

subclasses.
