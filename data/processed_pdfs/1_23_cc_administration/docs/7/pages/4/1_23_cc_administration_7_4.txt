has been prepared. For the use of this assembly each group of con-
densed cards must be preceded by a standard symbolic card with CND
as its operation part. On the first card following the CND card,
the condensed symbolic instructions need not start in column 1, but
once started must run continuously from card to card because the asâ€”
sembly program will interpret the first blank which is superfluous
from the point of view of condensed symbolic instructions as a sig-
nal to read another card record and go back to standard symbolic
notation.

This usage makes it possible to make modifications to a program
on condensed cards by duplicating the card on which the instruction
is to be changed up to the point of the change, leaving it blank
from that point on, then inserting one or more ordinary symbolic
cards with the changed instructions, following this with a CND
card and then a copy of the card where the program continues in
condensed form., This last card may be blank up to a certain point.

Because of the way the condenser interprets an END card, no
END cards will appear in a condensed deck produced by the program,
A condensed program will always end in enough blanks to signal a
return to standard symbolic notation so that standard END card can
be added.

CAUTION: When inserting standard cards in a condensed deck it
is necessary to make sure that the last condensed instruction to be
kept 1s followed by an extra blank to signal the return to standard
notation., If the last instruction to be kept has its last character
(usually a blank) in columm 72, it will be necessary to add a blank
card.

1t 1s not envisaged that condensed symbolic cards will be
prepared by hand keypunching because the chances for error are too
great and 1t is not easy to correct an error that makes an instruc-
tion too short or too long. Instead it is proposed that condensed
decks be prepared by the condenser program from standard symbolic
decks.,

A condensed library tape has the following form. The sub-
routines are in 00 word (2400 character) records, except that the
last record of a subroutine will usually be shorter than LOO words.,

The first word of the first record of a subroutine is the name of
