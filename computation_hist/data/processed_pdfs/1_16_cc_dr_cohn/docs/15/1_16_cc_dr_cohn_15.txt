A pERIODIC ALGORITHM FOR CUBIC FORMS=|=

By HARVEY Conn.

 

1, Introduction. In a very famous memoir in 1896, Minkowski

. . 5
set up a continued fraction type of algorithm for the product of three r[ea]1
linear homogeneous forms in three integral variables.

_ . By the precedent set
in the ordinary theory of binary quadratic forms, such an algorithm has to
supply a deﬁnition of rcduccd form. with several properties; First

of all ever
form should be equivalent under y

unimodular change of variables to one or
more reduced forms. Furthermore a concept of neighboring form should be

present so that the reduced forms will arrange themselves into chains.
Finally when the three linear forms are conjugates, each spanning a (totally
real) cubic module, the number of distinct reduced forms should be ﬁnite.
Probably the most immediate application of such an algorithm would be the
determination of units of a totally real cubic ﬁeld as automorphs within
the ﬁnite chain of forms.

The purpose of this work is to present a new algorithm for such cubic
forms, combining some of the features of an ordinary (modiﬁed) continued
fraction algorithm with some of the features of Minkowski’s algorithm. This
new algorithm follows the former one to the extent that reduction is based on
a visually convenient array of + and —— signs rather than on “admissible”
bodies; and it follows the latter algorithm to the extent that the proof given
here for the reduction theorem uses Minkowski’s work as a convenient starting
point. Once the theoretical aspects are established, it will be seen that the

actual calculations in cubic ﬁelds are very simple, although the units obtained
there are far from thoroughly investigated.

2. Modiﬁed simple continued fraction algorithm. The familiar simple
continued fraction (for binary quadratic forms) of course fulﬁls the above
requirements par excellence. We present a modiﬁcation to emphasize some
curious resemblances to the deﬁnition of reduced forms that we presently
give for cubics. The quadratic form may be written

We recall that a lattice is said to be admissible With respect to a COMM

intended application, where the triple (bl-1, his, his) spans the totally real

6. Alternative form of the reduction theorem. We have . shewn that
every basis is equivalent under change of basis to a reduced basis, It .13 no
loss of generality to assume that the change of basis involves a matrix of
determinant +1 (as all basis vectors can be multiplied by _1 Wlthout
attecting the deﬁnition of reduction). Likewise we may assume by (4‘ 21)

The above statement can be easily veriﬁed. We further note that the
hard case must be separated since the three numbers at), a2, a, can otherwise be
arbitrarily close to one another and still satisfy the conditions ('7. 2) There-

which k,+ l,- + m,7£0, while the other three vectors would be such that
79H. 1, —|— m,- = 0, contradicting condition (4. 21).

Fortunately, in many applications, the hard case simply does not occur.
For instance, for later reference, take

(7-3) Ori=EEIKPOZWim/r), (k=1,2,3),

where p (E 1 mod 3) is a prime and m through a complete set of residues
of cubic character indicated by It. Here a, -|— are + a, =—1, and therefore
if the on were all of one sign (as in (7. 2)), we should have i aloha: i g 1/27
in contradiction to the fact that a is an algebraic integer. Hence the lattice
given by (7. 1) and (’7’. 3), (determined by contraction of a cyclotomic ﬁeld),
has a reduced basis very close to the cyclic basis described here.

8. Norms and discriminants. We now consider the case where the
£1, $2, $3 components in (4. 42) are the conjugates of three numbers spanning
it (totally real) cubic ﬁeld. We shall show that although the neighbor process,
for instance, produces a chain of 3 X 4 matrices (see 12 below), they are
strictly proportional to only a ﬁnite number of classes. Thus the ternary and
quaternary forms take on only a ﬁnite number of values

A PERIODIC ALGORITHM FOR CUBIC FORMS
HARVEY COHN

A lattice in three-dimensional space will be called reduced if its basis vectors
1}”, 1?), xi” together with xﬁ” = —Z x§"(j = 1, 2, 3), lie one in each octant
of space or its negative octant. It may be seen that every lattice has a reduced
sublattice of universally bounded index (and the examination of a handful of
cases may even reveal this index to be unity). This type of algorithm is very
similar to one by Minkowski in which the basis vectors were three shortest
independent vectors under certain deformations, and two bases were called
neighbors if they had two basis vectors (out of three) in common, making three
neighbors in general. In the author’s algorithm the bases are “not far” from "
Minkowski’s bases, and the process of ﬁnding neighbors involves agreement of
two (out of four) basis vectors. Here there are three to six neighbors in general,
making for more complicated patterns.

Similarly, reduced quaternary forms 112an (j = 1, 2, 3, 4; i = 1, 2, 3)
can be deﬁned. If this form is the norm in a totally real cubic module, it can
be shown there are only a ﬁnite number of reduced forms under change of basis;
and the neighbor concept will lead to ﬁnite (periodic) multidimensional struc-
tures. Finding the structures by this algorithm is very simple since it involves
only patterns of signs. For the integers in the cubic ﬁeld for which D = 49, the
structure of the norm is 8 forms connected like the vertices of a cube. For D = 81
and D = 148, the structures have 16 and 28 forms respectively. Structures with
certain symmetries turn out to correspond to abelian ﬁelds, and the periodicity
of the structures, oflcourse, leads to unitics of the ﬁeld.

indeed it can be seen to check with the deﬁning equations.

In this way We obtain by succession sub-sets of the matrices in each
strict proportionality class (in fact, we obtain sub-sets with positive relative
proportionality constants). Certain of these strict proportionality classes are
neighbors to one another. Hence we may always draw these classes as points

connected by lines indicating neighbors. This is done in ﬁgures 1 and 2 (qt v.,
also see tables below).

13. Further calculations. We submit now, ﬁve calculations of closed
chains, summarized in the accompanying table. The modules taken are some
of the integral modules with lowest discriminant. The case A9: 196 is the
sannodule of index 2 of A9: 49, while A2 =148 is, of course, nonnbcli' :ii

The ($1) conjugates are taken in an order consistent with the sign matrix
(4. 22).

are proportional, they are strictly proportional, since the constants of propor-
tionality, being the eigenvalues of a unimodular matrix, have the product 1.
Since the eigenvalues are also conjugate algebraic integers, in the conjugate
cubic ﬁelds, they are either all 1 or are conjugates or a “civtrivial unit of
the ﬁeld. From the rational independence of the column vectors, the eigen-
values are all 1 only when the two 3 X 4 matrices are identical. In fact
in the example (A2 = 81) of ﬁg. ‘2, there are even closed circuits such as
¢0(Q.P.R)¢z(R.P.S)¢5(S.P.Q)¢o which produce the trivial unit. (The cir-
cuit ¢o(Q.P.R)¢2(RS-Q)¢3(P-Q.S)¢4(Q.R.P)¢o incidentally produces a non-
trivial unit). In each of the ﬁve cases treated here, independent (non-trivial)
units can be observed. It is clear that as we take an increasing large number
of different ﬁelds the (L p'rtm‘i necessity of obtaining diﬁereut units will
increase the complexity of the non-trivial circuits, but no further speculation
on this will be attempted at present.
