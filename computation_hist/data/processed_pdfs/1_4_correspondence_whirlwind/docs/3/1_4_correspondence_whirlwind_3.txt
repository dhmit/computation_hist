Dear Professor Morse:

Ever since our conference early in May, the problems of ONR's Whirlwind
Program, as they emerged at that time, have been very much on my mind, By
now, a number of ideas are beginning to crystallize which T should like to
set down in order to get your reaction and comments,

In the first place, I should like to recommend a drastic reduction, put into
effect in the course of the next few months, as regards charges to our con=-
tract for assistance and consultation furnished to current and prospective
users of the machine, A fraction of a single person's time, and perhaps

that even distributed over severel people, should be enough, To an
imaginative young scientist with original ideas in his own field of interest,
——and it is only this type of person which our contract should preeminently
serve to support, =a sizeable amount of such guidance and consulting work
must be rather deadening, Presumably MIT's academic budget could be tapped,
beginning as of this fall, to defray the cost of giving the periodic short
@urseon programming and coding if past experience has shown it to be
particularly helpful and effective, Beyond this, the user, especially if
engaged in academic rather than assigned research, might well be left to do
most of the work himself, —-making use of esteblished regular courses and of
the available literature and msnuals, It is probably true that he would then
have to spend somewhat longer on preparing his problem, partly by having to
learn more about machine operation, partly by wasting more time in debugging
his program, I think it would be unfortunate to consider this a reduction of
efficiency in the use of research personnel, such a concept of efficiency
being really not appropriate to an academic institution, The recommended
arrangement might also have a beneficial effect as regards machine accessibil=-
ity, favoring those with really consuming interests in the field over those
with the big, so-called urgent problems,

Hand in hand with this reduction in the help, extended to machine users as
part of the ONR program, I should like to recommend that charges be made for
the use of the machine on problems arising from projects which MIT is
undertaking mainly at the convenience of industrial concerns or Government
agencies, I think that the Committee on Machine Computations should be in a
position to decide, in the case of problems having their origin in sponsored
research, when to recommend that such a charge be levied and when not,
Lerge-scale machines on other campuses are earning annually from $30,000 to
more than $50,000 in this fashion, These funds can then be used to hire

personnel for the purpose of consulting with and helping such service users in
prepering and running their problems, In this way They will get their money's
worth, coming to the machine --as they generally dognot because they want to
but because they have to, and being interested therefore in getting their re-
sults with as little bother to themselves as possible, At the same time the

positions thus created would make good jobs for less gifted students, training
them to become solid computer technicians,

Professor P, M, Morse

A third and somewhat more long-range recommendation would be that of upgrading
the qualifications for the research assistantships allocated by the Committee
on Machine Computations, Since the commitments for the academic year 1954-1955
are already firm, this would affect only the selections made for the year
following, The field of computer applications is rapidly ceasing to be so
unknown and of such novelty as to require special inducements in order to
attract graduate students during their beginning years, I should like to pro-
pose that the holders of these research assistantships during the year 1955-1956
be of such a caliber that they can reasonably be expected to have produced a
substantial research paper for publication by the end of the year. In case the
body of advanced graduate students on hand at MIT provides an insufficient
number of such candidates, it might be possible and should definitely be worth-
while to go beyond the MIT campus in the selection of incumbents, There must
be a growing number of outstanding young researchers on less well equipped
campuses, whose work is forcing them to take an even more substantial interest
in the applications of high-speed computers, Even so we should anticipate

that the total number of awards will be smaller than for the coming year,

My fourth recommendation, finally, is of even longer range. If, in the long
run, MIT's Digital Computer Laboratory is to compete, as far as the scientific
substance of its work is concerned, with what is being done even now and will
certainly be done in the near future by other university centers in the high-
speed computing field, currently being established at a number of places, it
seems To me inevitable that the staff of the Laboratory must acquire a strong
faculty core, representing both the engineering and the mathematical aspects of
its activity and relating its program closely to the corresponding depart
ments, These faculty members would be concerned with the academic training and
research program, made possible by the facilities of the Leboratory, and all
but nominal fractions of their salaries would come from MIT, This would give
them, materially as well as in their thinking, the independence from Government
and other contracts which is necessary to have them establish an imaginative
and original program with assured long-range objectives, Such an arrangement
would unquestionably lead to undertakings in whose sponsorship the Office of
Naval Research would gladly continue to particinate,

If these, or not too different, recormendations are considered to furnish
reasonable guide lines for the future of the Digital Computer Laboratory, the
following disposition of the funds available under our contract appears to be
indicated,

Coding, ete: This work appears currently to be a lively concern of Professor
Adams’ group, is of good quality, and is being followed with considerable inter-
est in computer circles generally, We shall be glad, therefore, to continue its
support at aporoximately its present level (which we understand to be about
five full-time people headed by Dr, Combelic) through 30 June 1956, but
probably not beyond that date,

(b) T snd Advis ospective Machine Users in
ting Then or Do ir Coding: As soon es possible, and preferably

by the beginning of the second term of the coming academic year, charges to

our contract for this activity should be reduced to a nominal amount of, 1
should suggest, not more than $10,000 per year, Those of the persons, in the
past primarily engaged in this latter activity, who are interested and

capable of carrying on original research in numericel eh might be re-
tained under the contract, provided that most of their time (say two-thirds or
more) ig dedicated to such research under whatever faculty supervision is
considered appropriate, Again, we shall be glad to provide this support through
30 June 1956 and shall be interested in discussing its continuation beyond that
date at the appropriate time,

(¢) The Research Assistantship Program under the Committee on Machine
Computationss For the academic year 1955-1956, the award of these assistantships
should be restricted to candidates who can be expected to produce a publishable
piece of substantial research during their tenure, involving a sizeable effort
of non-routine automatic computation, It does not, however, need to be re-
stricted to advanced graduate students at hand on the MIT campus at the time,
Even so, a substantial reduction in level is anticipated. Continuation of our
support for such an activity beyond 30 June 1956 would again be made to depend
on the way things work out,

According to the figures which formed the basis of our discussions back in May,
the unexpended balance under our contract as of 30 June 1954 was $410,000,00,
Rough estimates indicate that this should be, if anything, more than adequate
to operate the project under the proposed plan through 30 June 1956, In case,
however, an additional, certainly modest, amount should be required for this
purpose, we shall very likely be able to provide it,

The principal factor on which we would want to base the consideration of con
tinuing our support beyond 30 June 1956 is the establishment of a central core
of faculty members as part of the Digital Computer Laboratoryt!s staff, charged
with developing and conducting a strong academic program, Any arrangements for
future support would have to wait, therefore, for the plans of such a faculty
core of staff members,
