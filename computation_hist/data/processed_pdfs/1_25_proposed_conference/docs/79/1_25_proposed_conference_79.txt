Dear Wayne?

With regard to your proposed questionnaire on curriculum
I wish to make some suggestions. ost of these, and maybe
even all, you already have, but duplication would not hurt
in this case.

(1) An inventory of the courses given and to whom
they are available (graduate, undergraduate,
restrictions to students in specific schools).

(2) The number of students taking these courses.

3] Some subjective statement of the success of
these courses.

(4) List of courses that have died for lack of
support, or other reasons.

There is also some difficulty in establishing credits
in computing. Some critics oppose credits for computing by
saying that it's like giving credits for slide rule. A
question giving the respondant an opportunity to indicate
what he thinks should be the maximum credits in the under-
graduate curriculum for various phases of computing (coding,
general machine use, applied numerical analysis, use of
compilers, etce)

If I can be of any assistance, let me knowe If you would
like to pre-test the questionnaire I would be glad to answer
a rough draft and A time involved, together with much
destructive criticism.

sincerely yours,
