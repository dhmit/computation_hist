z. Kopal, C. Lin, P. M. Horse and E. ﬁeissner

rhe deliberations of the Committee at this meeting were taken
up almost entirely with consideration of the cases of Verzuh end
Booton. The Sub—Committee mentioned in the last minutes reported
that they had talked to Verznh and made two recommendations:

(a)~ That Verzuh not be asked to take a regular written
qualifying examination, but that his preparation
in his field be Checked during the coming term and
Summer by taking at least one course in mathematics
(probably M39), that he start on his thesis research,'
particularly in its analytic aspects and that the
end of the Spring or during the Summer he take an
oral on two or three aspects of mathematics or elec—
trical engineering, which will be considered to be
. his official examination in the field of his major.
If he passes this examination and satisfies his
.supervisory committee concerning his course work in
mathematics and his preliminary research on his
thesis, he will be considered to be ready to com»
piste his thesis and take his final thesis examina—
t on.

(b) That, in the opinion of the Sub-Committee Verzuh
would not be able to carry on this Spring program
effectively unless ne.were given full time to work on
it. The Committee then voted that Morse should ask
Stratton whether it were possible to give Verzuh a
leave of absence,with pay, from his job this Spring
so that he could carry out this program, and to
recommend to the Electrical Engineering Department
that Brown, Fesnbech, Kopal and heissner be his
supervisory committee for his general Oral examina—
tion and for his thesis. horse will report to this
supervisory committee end to the Electrical Engineer»
ing Department the result of his conversation with
Stratton.

Subsequent to the meeting, Morse saw Stratton and told him the
recommend tions of the Committee. Stretton is_to investigate as to
whether Vereuh can be given leave of absence this coning term, and

under wuet-arrangements Verzuh can be supported financially. If
it turns out that Verzuh cannot be spared this coming term, it
was suggested that Verzuh be given a year's leave of absence, be-
ginning in June, to prepare for his orals and to get well along
in his thesis (perhaps even complete it).

Booton has indicated that, if he were asked to pass a
qualifying examination including electronics, he might have to
postpone his examination for a term in order to brush up on this
subject. The Committee investigated the possibility of Eooton's
taking the qualifying examination in mathematics (his course work
indicates that this might be possible). The Committee felt that,
if he were to continue his registration in the Electrical Engi-
neering Department and take his thesis with an Electrical Engi-
neering supervisor, Booton should have some knowledge of elec—
tronics and that it would be therefore advisable for him to take
the additional term to prepare for an examination of the type
mentioned in the last minutes. 0n the other hand, if Booton
still wished to take the mathematics qualifying examination, he
Should then transfer his registration to the Mathematics Depart—
ment and expect to take his thesis with a Mathematics Department
supervisor (although there could be readers for the thesis from
the Electrical Engineering Department). This latter alternative
might mean that he would have to modify his plan for thesis to
some extent, including more mathematics in the research, but in
the end it was felt that this is desirable. There was some in-
dication that Carrus, mentioned in the previous minutes, should
also consider these alternatives. Consequently, no action will
be taken on a possible modified Electrical Engineering qualify—
ing examination to be given in February, as mentioned in the pre—
vious minutes, until Kopal (and possibly Morse) has talked to
Booton and Carrus and found out their desires in this matter.

The next meeting of the Committee will be 9330 Wednesday,
January 3, at which time the Committee will take up the continu-
ing question of courses in the field of macnine computation, and
will start the consideration of possible contracts for the sup-
port of some of the machines at the Institute.
