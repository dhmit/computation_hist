Subject: Electronic Data Processing Equipment in the Computation Center

 

The purpose of this memorandum is to provide a list of the number
and type of data processing machines available in the MIT Computation Center.
In addition, the monthly rental caste of each unit has been adjusted to agree
with the new rental ﬁgures which are effective Earch l, 1957. Table 1 contains
a list 02 the machines which are used as part of the 704 Calculator on an on—line
or an off-line basis. By off-line we mean the peripheral equipment such as,
tepe-to-csrd converter, card—to-taye converter, and the tapercontrnlled printer,
respectively .

In addition to the electronic data processing equipment associated
with the Type 704 Calculator, there are certain electric- accounting machines
(RAH) which complement the 704 and these will be located in the basement of
the West wing in Room 26—053. Table II provides a breakdc'v'm of the number- and

’type of electric accounting machines which will complement the 734 Calculator.

it is interesting to note that the combined monthly rental of the
704 Calculator and the me equipment is as follows:

704 $43,600

EAR 1 I 760

Total . 9 $45,360

Thus, it is apparent that 3232‘s contribution to the Computation Center in tea-me
of machine equipment alone is $45,360 per month an $544,320 per year.
