MIDPME —- DOUBLE-PRECISION SOLUTICN OF MATRIX EQUATIONS
R. M. Moroney 9 July 1958

Mses., Inst, of Tech, Operations Research Project

This routine is dedicated to the proposition that anybody fooling
éround with double-precision numbers ie worried about loss of significant
figures somewhere, and very likely in the solution of & set of linear
equations, Consequently no computer time is spared in milking the best
resulte possible from the coefficient matrix supplied, and an estimste

of the significant figures in the solution vector is computed,

&, This routine requires one tape unit whose logical number must be -

specified by a card of the form: NINE EQU X, X is normelly 9,

 

b. This routine contains a modified version of RSO05 which is available
to the user, Modificstions consist only of return to X+1 instead of
X+ 2 on the two sequences TsX 8005,4 and TSX S005 + 5,4,

This routine contsins a tapewriting routine BOUTS, and & tape reading
routine BLINS, which are aVailable to the user, See Appendix I,

This routine contsins a set of floating-point checking routines “
ADDOV, MULTO, and DIVCK, which are available to the user. Apvrendix II.

Ce The coefficient metrix ang right-hand side must be in normal form
for RSO05, i.e. lesst-significant pert of number in register succeeding
most-significeant pert, agreement in sign between both parts, exponent |

of least-significant pert 33 (octal) less then that of most sig part,

 

Error estimates must be normalized single-register floeting-point

numbers (error estimates will be defined lster),
