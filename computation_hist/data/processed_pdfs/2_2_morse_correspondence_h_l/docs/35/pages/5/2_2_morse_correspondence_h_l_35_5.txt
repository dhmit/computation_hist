some ordering temperature, however, the covalent
bonds are frozen into one of t_he three blax1al.planes,
and the octahedral-site cation 1s bound to the six near-
neighbor anions by four coplanar covalent bonds z%nd
two linear electrovalent bonds. Because of orbltal
overlap, the four coplanar covalent bonds are shorter
than the two electrovalent bonds, and .the elementary
octahedron becomes distorted from cubic to tetragonal
symmetry with an axial ratio ¢/a>1. If the elementary
octahedra have tetragonal symmetry, .the elastic energy
of the crystal is minimized when their te.tragonal axes
are aligned parallel to one another. 'Ijhls produces a
distortion of the bulk lattice from cubic to tetragonal
symmetry with an axial ratio ¢/a>1. 5
If \ is the fraction of square-bond-forming cations in
octahedral sites, there exists a value A=\ below w.hlch
no distortion of the crystal occurs. For A <X\ there 15 no
alignment of tetragonally distorted octahedra to pro-
duce a bulk distortion of the lattice. For a tetragonal
distortion of the crystal it is necessary to have a con-
tinuously linked system of square bonds. Ior such a
long-range order to occur, each octahedral ion that does
not form square bonds must, on the average, have at
least two of its six octahedral near neighbors that do.
Therefore, for tetragonal distortion of the crystal
lattice to occur, at least 25 percent of the octahedral
cations must form square bonds. This means that the
minimum A, equals 0.25. .
If the band model is applied to the crystal, the highest
occupied electron-energy band is the (dsp®) covalent
band. Because orbital overlap decreases with decreasing
distortion, the energy of the (dsp?) covalent band 18
‘raised with decreasing axial ratio so that it become
easier to remove electrons from it. At high temperatures
some of the electrons are thermally excited from the
covalent band, However, when an electron 1s excited,

THEORY OF IONIC ORDERING

a hole is left in the covalent band so that the coplanar
covalent bonds in some octahedral site become
partially ionic. This ionic character resonates among
three mutually perpendicular planes and reduces the
difference between the character of the bonds parallel,
and that of the bonds perpendicular, to the ¢ axis so that
the tetragonal distortion is reduced. This, in turn,
facilitates the removal of an electron from the covalent
band. Thus the loosening of the square bonds from the
planes perpendicular to the ¢ axis is a cooperative phe-
nomenon, and the transition from the tetragonal to the
cubic phase occurs over a small temperature interval
when the sample is heated.

Conversely, if the sample is cooled from above the
transition temperature, there is a temperature at which
the covalent band is sufficiently full for some of the
covalent bonds to become frozen into place. This
“freezing in” of covalent bonds increases ¢/a and there-
fore the orbital overlap. An increase in the orbital over-
lap reduces the number of electrons which can be
thermally excited from the covalent bond so that more
covalent bonds are frozen in. Again there is a fairly
sharp transition temperature, but, because of the
difference in axial ratios, this temperature is lower than
that observed when the sample is heated. This tempera-
ture difference shows up as a thermal hysteresis which
varies in temperature change with the magnitude of the
axial ratio of the tetragonal phase.

In an ordered-bond model there is a correlation be-
tween the lattice distortion and the excitation energy as
measured by the temperature dependence of the con-
ductivity. A conductivity discontinuity and thermal
hysteresis at the transition temperature are correlated
with the discontinuity and hysteresis in the axial ratio.
[Further, the excitation energy decreases slowly with
increasing temperature so that a plot of the logarithm
of the conductivity vs the reciprocal of the temperature
does not give an ideally straight line.

According to the square-bond model the axial ratio
¢/a depends upon the ratio of the ionic-bond length to
the covalent-bond length. In Sec. IIIB, above, it was
shown that the amount of covalence in the octahedral
site, and therefore the bond length, depends on the type
of bond in the tetrahedral interstices. If strong tetra-
hedral, covalent bonds are formed in the tetrahedral
sites, the octahedral bond becomes more ionic and its
length is increased so that the ¢/a ratio is decreased.
The magnitude of this decrease is estimated in Appendix
I

The transition temperature at which the phase change
from tetragonal to cubic symmetry occurs varies with
the magnitude of the electronic-excitation energy. Since
the excitation energy varies with the magnitude of the
axial ratio ¢/a, the square-bond model leads to the
prediction that the transition temperature varies mono-
tonically as the ¢/a of the tetragonal phase provided all
other factors are constant.

In summary, the square-bond model leads to the

399

following predictions. (a) If cations (such as Cu'l,
Mn'T, Pd™) which form stable (dsp?) bonds occupy
octahedral sites in an oxide with the spinel structure,
then the lattice is distorted to tetragonal symmetry
with ¢/a>1. (b) At least 25 percent of the octahedral
cations must form square covalent bonds if lattice
distortion due to a long-range order of bond orientation
is to occur. (c) The magnitude of the axial ratio ¢/a
increases with the number of cations in octahedral sites
which form square bonds. However, strong covalence
in tetrahedral sites reduces the covalence in octahedral
sites and hence the axial ratio. (d) There is a narrow
temperature interval through which ¢/a decreases
rapidly to 1 to give cubic symmetry. (e) Through the
transition temperature interval there is a marked in-
crease in electric conductivity ¢ and a marked decrease
in the excitation energy. (f) The transition temperature
depends upon the magnitude of ¢/a at absolute zero.
(g) The transition shows a thermal hysteresis. (h) The
excitation energy decreases with increasing temperature.

2. Application of Theory to CuFe 0y

Bertaut*” has measured the lattice parameter and the
cation-ordering parameter A in CuFe;0y as a function of
temperature. The parameter X is the fraction of octa-
hedral interstices occupied by M?** ions; the ferrospinel
formula is therefore written as M_aFea (Fes_aMs)Oy.
The values A=0, §, ¥ correspond, respectively, to a
normal, statistically disordered, and inverse spinel.
Bertaut observed that CuFe,O4 is tetragonal below
760°C. The axial ratio ¢/a and the parameter \ both
decreased monotonically from room temperature to
700°C. Above 760°C the Cu*! cations are randomly
distributed in the anion interstices, and the lattice is
cubic. It is especially interesting that Bertaut, who was
convinced that the distortion to tetragonal symmetry
was due to cation ordering, was unable to find any
x-ray superstructure lines. The only ordering through
the transition is a concentration of Cu®** lons in the
octahedral sites; among the octahedral sites, however,
these ions are randomly distributed. Since the distortion
is not accompanied by ion ordering among octahedral
sites, it appears that the distortion is due to square-
bond formation. Since the copper ions in CuO are Cu™
and form square, coplanar bonds, they undoubtedly
form similar bonds in the spinel lattice. Because of the
steric constraints, these bonds can only be formed if the
Cu'! is in an octahedral site. If square covalent bonds
are formed in an octahedral site, the elementary octa-
hedron is distorted from cubic to tetragonal symmetry,
and the alignment of these octahedra produces the
macroscopic tetragonal symmetry of the crystal. This
hypothesis is consistent with the observation of van
Santen and van Wieringen'® that in CuFe.O, the oxygen
octahedron surrounding the Cu®* ilon is tetragonally
distorted.
