Dear Mr . Aucoin:

hm! thanks for your letter of March 16th telling me of the
availability of your ID! 70h cmputer on a rental basis.

In discussing this matter with some of w (:01le in the School
of Engineering, I lenrned that from tine to time our staff takes advan-
tage of the opportunity you have outlined. The difficulty cases in
connection with the student need for computer time because these are
the people who ordinarily are without financial support. It is hard
to find a way to help these worthy users within the limits of H.I.T.'s
financial ability to pay.

Sincerely yours ,

Gordon S. Brown, Dean
School of Engineering
