Neer Frank!

Thanks very mach for your memo of the 30th on the office
of atatisticsl cepvices. Ib is a thoughtful statement
of the problems involved in the contemplated move to
Building 20, end unhappily 7 must concede that most of
your grguments are welletaken.,

his is one of phose difficult problems of administration
for which no aplution 18 wholly gatisfactory, and the best
thet one can do 1g to try vo minimize the damegos. in

final decision to go anead with the move 1 have been

ded, as you know, bY gertaln long-term plans for the
atiligation of these central buildings which give first
priority to educational ectivities = and particularly to
undergraduate education,

1 am very cognigani of the additional tnconveniences that
these changnsd MEY cause to the users of your Services, but

I em confident thet as the nature of the problem 18 made
clear to our administrative of flcers, you will find complete
cooperation tn an offord to make the plan Words Your memo

1s most helpful in drawing attention to specific difficulties
that will have te be ironed oube

There is only one gonelusion in your memo that I feel 1b
necessary ic peconsiders On PRES 5 you indicate that each
administrative office should provide 1s own courler and
trenspor tation medium, I fear that this would causs a
considerable smount of duplication and would prove
impracticable. As & workable alternative I pelieve thal
the TeSe3e should employ & full-time messenger with &

guitable means oi transporting the material. With proper

scheduling 7 imagine that he would be able tc meet the
requirements of all users of the Services. The co8US would,

structure,

Let me assure you again, es I did in our conversation
last week, that thers is no change whatsoever in our
evaluation oi the importance of e& central compu ting
service, and we propose to proceed with the enlarged
development of this center in support of research as
rapidly as funds become available,

1 am most appreciative of Jour expressed desire to make
the best of the present situation and to contribute to
the longer range development of the center,
