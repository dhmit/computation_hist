Dear Professor Carr:
I received your letter on 13 April 1959 and above all want to express
my sincere thanks for your invitation. I hope that circumstances will

allow me to visit the United States this summer and meet with you.

Academician Dorodnitzin has written you a letter in which are stated a
series of questions connected with the details of my stay in the United

States.

Yesterday I received a letter from Professor Perlis in which is expressed
the hope for the possibility of expanding of the program with him in
order to visit the Carnegie Institute of Techn ology in Pittsburgh and

nearby to it other computation centers.

I also join in the request of Academician Dorodnitsin for obtaining
agreement with Professor Perlis and other persons for a complete

program in which would be indicated the possible places of visits.

Beyond this I have two personal questions, the answers to which I must
have in order to prepare the course of‚Äù lectures.

Question 1: How much time lasts a lecture? (How much time will one
Question 2: Of what expected scientific level lecture take?)
are the auditors?

In expectation of your answers with sincere respect.
