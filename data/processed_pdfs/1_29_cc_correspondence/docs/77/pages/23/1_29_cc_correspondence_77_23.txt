BCI

 

 

'"31415.9E-4B2" and ''31415.9B2E-4'"' are both acceptable and
represent the same number. Note that it is possible to

lose significant bits off either end of the word. 1In fact,
since many terminating decimals have non-terminating binary
representations, loss of bits to the right is often unavoid-
able., If bits are lost, no error will be indicated. A
number which is not an integer (i.e. written with either

a decimal point or an E) and is not fixed point (no B)

is floating point. A floating point number will be converted
to standard 709 floating point binary (i.e. sign bit, 8-bit
characteristic, and 27-bit fraction). The numbers ''3.14159",
""314159.E-5", ''314159 E-5'", and '"'.314159El" all represent

the same floating point number,

The BCI (Binary coded information) pseudo-operation is
used to generate data in the 709 BCD character code. One
to ten words of six characters each may be generated by
means of one BCI instruction. The variable field of the
BCI pseudo-operation is divided into two subfields. The
first subfield is a single decimal digit, followed by a
separating comma, which specifies the number of words to
be generated. By convention, a comma in column 12 (with
no preceding count) indicates that ten words are to be
generated. Since the length of the second subfield is
determined by the count in the first subfield, any valid
character (including comma or blank) may occur in the
second subfield. The BCI pseudo-operation is an exception
to the rule that the variable field is terminated the
first occurrence of a blank. If there is a symbol in the
location field, it is a relocatable symbol which refers

to the first word of the data generated. Thus the

instruction
LOCATION .QE VARIABLE FIELD

is exactly equivalent

to the instruction
