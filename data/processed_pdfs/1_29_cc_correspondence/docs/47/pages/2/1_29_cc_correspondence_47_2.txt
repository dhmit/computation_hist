c. Convergence of step ¢ in L, above is assured because we have

Qk‘: A X, = b
Rk’lgAxk*l-b-A(I-MA)xk-tAub-b

= (1 - &40R,

and our check of I - A assures convergence in the norm m:x Ixil‘

de. For step d above see Hildebrand Introduction to Numerical Analysis,
pp. L36 ff.

A is the FWA of the coefficient matrix, stored by columns.
B is the dimension.
C is the FWi of 2n X n consecutive registers, separated from X,
A,D and E, which may be used by the program for temporary

workspace. Contents of these registers will be restored.

D is the FWA of the right-hand side.

E is the FWA of a set of B single-register floating-point numbers,

the ith number being an estimste of the maximum magnitude of

error in any element of the ith row of the coefficient matrix.
These numbers are stored in every second register, and are un-

disturbed.
