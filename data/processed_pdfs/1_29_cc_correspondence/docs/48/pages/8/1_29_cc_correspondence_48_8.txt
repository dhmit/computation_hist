APPENDIX TEF

MIHIL1O Hilbert Matrix of order 10, double-precision in sense of RS005,
These cerds contain the segment of order ten of the Hilbert metrix, in the
form of RS005 double-precision numbers, correctly rounded to 18 octal digits.
They are designed to save the next guy the exercise in decimal-to-octal
conversion this writer undertook, Note that if the least-significant perts
of the metrix are sorted out for 8ingle-precision work, the remeining num-
