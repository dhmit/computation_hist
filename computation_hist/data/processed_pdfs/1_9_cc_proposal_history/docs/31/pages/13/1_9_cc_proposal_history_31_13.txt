,fﬁjTﬁe following machines have also been bullt at Research
" Laboratory of Electronics:

(1) A Network Synthesis Device which solves the approximation
- problem of network synthesis. Mathematically speaking, fhe

 

machine solves Poisson's equation.

(2) An Electronic Isograph which finds the roots of ‘polynomials
up to the sixth order.

(3) A Device for Solving 5 Simultaneous Algebralc Equations
by the method of steepest descent. This machine uses inte-
grators and is applicable only for positive definite matrices.

(4) A Digital Electronic Corrslator has been built which is
designed to compute correlation functions. The input equipment
obtains samples of the amplitude of the continuous signal inputs
and converts each sample to a 10-diglt binary number. The digital
nature of the machine allows for high accuracy to be obtained
(of the order of 1%). An additional unit, providing static
magnetic storage for 100 of the 10-digit binary numbers, 1s
under construction.
(5) An Analog Electronic Correlator is a recent addition to R.L.E.
This device works on the samé principle as the previously mentioned
one, but is simpler and smaller, in fact, portable. In order to
achieve flexibility, there has been some sacrifice in frequency
range (500 eycles - 100 kilocycles). The accuracy is of the
order of 5%.

(6) A machine for computing probability distributions. This
pachine makes two counts, determining whether a given event

happens or not. More precisely, if samples a given wave and
