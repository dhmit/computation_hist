precede it, and its effect continues until another LST occurs,

legal LST appears.in & program, then the entire program is listed on the

PRINTER OUTPUT TAPE,

The SAP pseudo-operations, SKP, SPC;, and PLR, also affect the

listing. /Any combination of these with LST is permitted,

. (2) The pseudo-operation

PRG -
controls the punching of binary decks by the assembly program and must
have one of the following words in its variable field,

_ON Produce a binary deck in row binary form on
the on-line punch.
OFF Produce a binary deck in column binary form

on the PUNCH OUTPUT TAPE
NONE Do not produce a binary deck,
If none of these words appears, then the PRG pseudo-operation is ignored.

PRG is a program segment variable, If no legal PRG pseudo-operation occurs

in a program, then a binary deck is not punched,

The kind of binary cards produced is determined by the occurrence

i

n the program of the SAP pseudo-operations, ABS, REL, or FUL, which also
are program segment variables,
mitted,

Any combination of these with PRG is per-
48 However, if the Pseudo-operations, REL or FUL, occur in a symbolic
ec then the.

INPUT TAPE and t

section 2,3,.4 and chapter 3

2-6

ON Produce a binary symbol table in row binary

form on the on-line punch

OFF Produce a binary symbol table in column binary
form on the PUNCH OUTPUT TAPE
NONE Do not produce a symbol table

If none of these words appears, then the SMT pseudo-operation will be

ignored, SMT is not a program segment variable, All but the last legal

If no legal SMT card

occurs in a program, then a symbol table is not punched.

SMT card read during an assembly will be ignored.

The three pseﬁdo-operations are independent of one another and
can occur in any sequence, The following statements describe the order
in which the binary cards are punched,

(1) A title card of the form

BIN M100-5-1
will always precede any off-line output produced by PRG or SMT cards,
The user's title (assigned in the variable field of the SAP title card)

will appear in its variable field, BIN title cards are never punched on-

line,

(2) The symbol table (if selected by SMT) is punched next on
the selected punch,

(3) The program (if selected by PRG) is punched last on the

selected punches,

A List of Changes to SAP

(1)

The pseudo-operation

PLB Push Load Button

is ignored,
(2) The pseudo-operation
BOS N Binary Output Select

is replaced by the pseudo-operation, PRG, 1f BOS with a blank variable

field occurs, then it is treated like the pseudo-operation

PRG ON
If BOS with a non-blank variable field occurs, then it 1is treated like
the pseudo-operation

PRG OFF
