6., EAM Room Air Conditioning

According to the air conditioning maintenance staff,
it is impossible to reduce the large amcunt of cold
air entering the EAM room., I would like to discuss
this matter with Dick Collins so that corrective
action may be taken since the temperature in the high
50's is too cold for working in the room.
