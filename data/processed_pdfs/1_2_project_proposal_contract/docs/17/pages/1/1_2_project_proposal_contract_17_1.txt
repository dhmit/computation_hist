Reference: Contract N5ori-06001

Dear Sir:

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology submits
herewlth a proposal for extenslon of the reference contract to
June 30, 1957 at an additional estimated cost of $20,960.00.

We understand that this proposdl has been the subject of discus-
slong between Professor P. M. Morse of MIT and Mr., A. J. Wise

of ONR-HIT, Dr. Carl F. Mukenhaupt of ONR-~-Boston, and Dr. F. J.
Weyl of ONR-Washington.

There Tollows & summary of expenditures and funds
remaining on the two projects, Whirlwind Operation and Machine
Methods of Computatlon, which are currently actlve under the
reference contracth:

- Project #6345 (Whirlwind Operation) has an unexpended
balance of $97,000 as of November 30, 1955. The current expend-
itures are approximately $10,000 per month. The average "income"
received for Whirlwind usage is approximately $3,000 per month --
a net expenditure of $7,000 per month. If it is assumed that the
pregent level of income ($3,000 per month) is maintained during
the ninefteen-month period December 1, 1955 to June 30, 1957, a
minimum amount, assuming some tapering off, of $119,000 will be
required during this perilod. |

Project #6915 (Machine Methods of Computation) hag an
unexpended balance of $71,000 as of November 30, 1955. The current
expendltures are approximately $7,000 per month. If it assumed
that the present expendl tures remaln constant, there will be a
balance of epproximately $22,000 on June 30, 1956. In accordance
with our present plang for terminating the ONR support of this
project on June 30, 1956, there will be certain additional term-
inating expenditures. It is estimated that 87,000 will be
expended for termination pwposes.

This summary 1s based on estimates prepared by Prof-
egsor P. M. Morse.

Profesgor Morse further advlises that the expected
arrival of an IBM Type 704 Electronic Data Processing Machlne at
MIT about Januvary 1, 1957 wlll create & definite need for addi-
tionsl funds--to finance the converslion of existing Whirlwind
programs to Type 704 programs.
