A discussion of the problems involved in putting Share subroutines
on Fortran would be of interest, According to my understanding of the
Fortran manual, this would not be difficult, yet the fact that this ap-
parently is not done must have some basis,

How does one go about estimating machine time? This is also involved
in deeciding when to use tape, when to use cards, when to use on-line equip-
ment, when to use off-line equipment, What are the limitations, if any,
in printing or punching off-line from tape ( for example, I don't believe
it is possible to print out from tape in a different order from that in
which the tape was made),

Cohen is interested in a program for latent structure analysis and
many social scientists would be interested in such a program, I believe
Cohen would agree with me that such a Program would probably involve having
such people as Phil Green and Wilfred Gibson in sas consultants for brief
periods of time,

 

Another interesting program similar to latent struecture but Simpler
in many aspects would be a program for developing a Guttman scale. Prac.
tically all present methods rely at some point on the human judgement of
the appearance of a pattern., It would be interesting to develop eriteria
for the machine to use, or, at worst, to develop a brogram for using the
CRT in identifying the pattern,

I have doubtless written more now than is worth your time to read
and I still haven't said anything about actual research designs, methods
of data ¢ollection, ete., etc. Again let me say that this is not to be
taken as criticism, You asked me to Jot down some of my ideas and T Just
let myself go on how I visualized a project on the implications of digital
computers for social science research, An extra copy of this letter is
enclosed so that you can give it to Professor Morse,

Sincerely yours,

P.S, May I Suggest that, if possible, a typewriter of Some description
(definitely not electrics be made available to the people on the second
floor, TFor many people a typewriter greatly facilitates the recording
of ideas, and this in turn stimulates more ideas, and besides, it is one
of the amenities of research,
