Morse and Verzuh reported the results of a conference
with Heeere. Little and Foster concerning the operation of the
IBM equipment. They reported that it was finally agreed that
the projects who could afford to pay for IBM time would have
first call on the equipment'during the day but that research
proJects and other educational work would have first priority
for work during the evening, and that when this work was approved
by the Machine Committee, there would be no charge for IBM time.
The evening work would, of course, require active participation
on the part of the research workers, and the nachines would be
used on a "self. service" basis. In order to support the rental
charges for the equipment, the projects would be charged at a
rate of $15 an hour. This means that educational research in
the Institute, which is approved by the Committee, will have
access to the IBM equipment during the last part or the evening
hours without cha .

Seirert reported that the analogue machine project was
endeavorins to work out a similar arrangement that he would re—
port in more detail later.

Forrester reported preliminary entimatee on the cost
of rtmning and maintaining Whirlwind I and the MPG computer if
and when military support is withdrawn. He estimated that an
"adequate budgetl for providing service and maintaining one or
the other of these machines, without additional development or
improvement of the machine, would run about $90,000 a year.

This project included a staff or 3 engineers and 7 technicians
plus the usual 46 per cent overhead on aalary. If this support
could not be afforded, a form of lees satisfactory service could
he provided for a lesser sum, approximately $50,000 a year, where
the machine would be used on a "self service" baais. I: both
machines were to he kept, the cost would not be twice this but
would be approximately $120 000 on an "adequate basis" or per-
haps $75,000 on an "austerity basis“. For competent service,

of course, there would he needed also an analysis group similar
to that carried on by Adams at preaent, which would cost approxi—
mately $50,000 a year additional on an "adequate basic".

After some diacuaeion it appeared that the Comttee
could not strongly advocate keeping at the Institute both WI
