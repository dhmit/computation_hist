Dear Phil:

Your letter of May 13th was waiting for me when I returned
recently. It may be that the issue you raised in that letter
1s now dead, or that some definite action has already been
faken, in the light of the IBM Conference in June.

It seems To me that there is some point to having at least

an informal meeting of directors of university computing cen-
ters and 1t may well be that the Eastern Computer Conference in
Cambridge could be such a time. There are three general areas
where some useful discussion might be possible. The first is

an exchange of information about the curricula associated with
the centers and the experiences with them. Secondly, such a
group may well be a source where a director of a new organization
may get Information and advice and, if possible, encouragement.
Thirdly, it 1s conceivable that such a group may be the place
the government and large foundations may seek advice or be given
advice as to what organizations in the computer field should be
supported financially. I would therefore quietly suggest such

a meeting on a very informal basis and see whether indeed there
are enough issues to warrant the continuation of such meetings.

I was sorry not to see you either at the Paris meeting or the
one in Cambridge, but perhaps our paths will cross sometime in
the near future. It would be good to learn of the experiences
of your Computation Center.
Most sincerely yours,
Heck
