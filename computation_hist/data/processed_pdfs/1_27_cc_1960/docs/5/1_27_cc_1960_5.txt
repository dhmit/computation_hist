Subject: New England College 704 Use, 1957 - 1959

The attached histograms of New England College usage may be of
interest.

Figure #1 represents a count of the number of different colleges actually
using the 704 each month. During 1959 there were twenty~one colleges
who used the 704 out of the thirty—one participating.

Figure #2 is an up-to-date histogram of the hours of usage each month.
Figure #3 is simply a count of the number of different project numbers
using the 704 from New England Colleges each month. Figure #3 thus
indicates that the increased usage is coming from an increased number
of people using the 704, not just longer problems by the same people.
