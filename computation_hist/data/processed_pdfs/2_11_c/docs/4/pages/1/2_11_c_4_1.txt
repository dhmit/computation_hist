_ ‘Dear’ Johnr

, Thanks for your letter of December 22. I should be
happy indeed to hear from Hr. Anderson. I have not heard
, from hen yet. Per-hope you could indicate to him that if he
wishes to apply for next year, he had better do it soon. ‘I‘
have spread the word about your needs at Ehapel Hill and now
that the vacations are over. I will mention it again.

We are all sorry that you will not be with us this ,
coming term. We hope your plans for Chapel Hill are going
smoothly and we hope to see you soon. Is there any chance
that you will come this way during the spring?

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse
