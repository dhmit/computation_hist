Dear 8ir:

| This is to inform you that your problem indicated above has been
allocated the time indicated for the FOURTH Quarter, October 1 -~ December 31, 1988,
Since the totel time roquosted for the FOURTH Quarter exceeds the total time
gvailable, your request has been cut down,

I would like sgain to emphasize that the above allotted 704 machine
time is applicable only during the pericd October 1 - December 3%, 1888, If
additional mechine time is needed during this guarter, a request for additioaal
pachine time may be made by writing s letter to me asking for more t{ime --
explaining why it 15 meeded,

It is necessary for you to justify your request because machine time
is becoming an increasingly precious commodity! For example, on September 28,
there were four hundred and eighty-one (48l1) problems assigned on the 704, This,
naturaily, limits the maximum emount of time available to any one candidate,
Because of the great demend for computer time, we would eppreciate it if you will
notify the Center, =8 soon &8 your problem is coumpleted.

Sincerely yours,

F 7). Yorgel
