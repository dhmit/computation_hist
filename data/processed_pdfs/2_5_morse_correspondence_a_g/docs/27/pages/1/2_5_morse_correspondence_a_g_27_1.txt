I'm sorry I muud you snn week, beoauu I'm
:_;,_Hreally getting upuet about the progress of the-Center.

- ¥ n the first place, we - nsked IBM to start delivery,fﬁ;'vtf l
or some or the peripheral equipment ahead of time, beeauae s e AR
. we wanted to use it to get routines and cards worked up RGP S S R
-~ before the 704 got here. (We talked this over with you last -
- spring and saild then we would need two bays-=or at the piﬁeh,-;'-d'

~ one bay--next to Frank's place in Building 20, to set up ohe- =0
. machines, to nork with the rest of Frank's peOple and P g
‘maehines.) 5 | o I

Well, the machines aro here and more are coming
next week! And there was hardly space to get them out of
the rain!{ If IBM asks whether we are now us them after
they bust a gut getting them here, we'll have to 8ay no.

- In the meantime, of the three bays next to Frank Verzuh,
one is given to the Technique for a month!, two to AFROTC
and part of the one beyond, as far as anyone can see, 1s a
coffee room for the janitors! And we can't even get the
one bay after Technique 15 through with it! What do 1 say
to IBM? |

 

i On the other point, the air. conditioning I want
to let you know that I am no longer worrying about its
additional cost since I got the figures. We can prove, in
the case of the air conditioning, that 1/3 of its cost
(50,000 out of the total 160,000) is caused by architeet's
requirements which we didn't care about in the first place.
In addition, for the 160,000 we are not getting the con-
ditioning we need to use the machines for education (noise,
again) so we are going to have to demand more pressure, even
if it costs more money--otherwise we can'i use the 704 for
classes. The need for the additional pressure comes entirely
