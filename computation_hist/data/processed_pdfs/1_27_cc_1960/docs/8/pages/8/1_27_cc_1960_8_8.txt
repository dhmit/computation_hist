M.I.T. Computation Growth

The large problems described, as well as the smaller but
more numerous problems should not be preempted from the comâ€”
puter because of commas time requirements of very large
users, inoluding on-line users. These requirements, when
combined with the need to minimize the waiting time to
actually state and run a problem on s eomvutsr dictate that
a large machine, capable of tine-sharing or nultiprogramming
be available. It further dictates that this machine must
have a very large immediate and backup random access storage,
in order to successfully kaesp many simultaneous customers
content with a fraction of its capabilities.

Our presentresesroh in time sharing on the 7011- shows
that a machine can be successfully used in this fashion, and
that the requirements for extension to a full blown system
with a large number or specialized input output devices at
remore locations point in the direction of a stretch class
computer. A large number of small computers are not equiva-
lent both in the sense of having less capacity available to
the user and in the sense of the cost of computation.
