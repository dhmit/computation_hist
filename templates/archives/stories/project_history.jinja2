<p> The Archival History of Computing Project began in November 2018 with a cohort of MIT
    undergraduate students
    under the mentorship of the Digital Humanities program at MIT. With 150 years of archival history,
    the MIT Libraries'
    <a href="https://libraries.mit.edu/archives/">Distinctive Collections</a> played a
    crucial role in our project by allowing us to utilize their documents and scan them, as well
    as providing staff support from Distinctive Collections and subject liaison librarians.
</p>
<p> Overall, our project was divided into five stages. During the first stage, we worked with the
    documents directly: studying them, scanning them, and simultaneously,
    working on the metadata that described them: box number, folder number, folder name, author,
    title, data, type, start
    page, last page, recipients, carbon-copied recipients,
    the organizations that the people in this document were a part of, and notes.
    In the second stage, we both developed the underlying Django database for the site
    and also a better understanding of the history of
    computation. This allowed us to proceed to stage three, where we focused on
    attaining a better glimpse of the history of computation by
    reading articles, doing research, and comparing with our own documents.
    We also
    outlined our goals for what we wanted our users to experience,
    learn, and gain from our project. Even with
    this large database, we found that it was still difficult to highlight the crucial role of women in
    the history of computation because they worked in the background and
    generally were not highlighted in the
    documents. (Did you know that 30 to 50 percent of computer programmers during
    the 1960s were women? We took this challenge and embedded it
    into our goal.) We wanted to give credit to every person who contributed
    to the history of computation â€” a field so
    dominant today. During the third stage, we were also focused on the backend and
    frontend of the website, developing a
    user interface and coding our platform. In the fourth stage, we used our
    website to analyze our information in order
    to write stories, make Javascript simulations of the IBM 704, and to create data visualizations.

    The fifth and final stage, was the completion of our mission by deploying the site publicly and
    linking to our
    <a href="https://github.com/dhmit/computation_hist">open-source code</a>.
