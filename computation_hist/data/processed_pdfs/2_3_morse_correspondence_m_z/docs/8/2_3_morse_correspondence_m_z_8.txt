More then one rundred seientiste and engineers from lew Englend

~ colleges will take the first step toward using the facilities of
the new ¥.1. T.. Computation center at a special: two-week program

epee at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on August 20,

i They wily learn the principles of preparing problems to be |
solved by a modern. high-speed computing. machine. | Thelr. study will
be in preperation for their: use of the IBM Spe 70h Dita Process-

= An Machine, a. large electronic computer, which will be installed

at M. T.7s later this year, : i,

The program iil mark the opening of a cooperative venture
betwen LM, M.I. Tes end other New Fngland colleges to increase
the numbers of scientists and engineers qualified to use modern
computing mechines, and to learn more about their application to
research problems in many fields. 2
Under special RREALgEalRYY with the International Business
Machines GoEpoTsn ian, the type 70h computer will be operated at
‘MM, 1, 7. to solve problems ‘brought by research Rk rE in & wide
veriety of fields et the participating New Fngland colleges. Those
ettending the program beginning on August 20, according to Pro=-
fessor Philip M, Morse of "1.0 who directs the Computation
Center, will be those who expect to use the machine as soon 88 it
1e svaileble early in 1957.

The two-week program will be given by nine members of the

M.T.T, staff, two representatives of Internetional Business

Machines Corporation, and one faculty member from a participating

With a staff of more than 30 people, the M.I.T. Center will be
the largest end most versatile data processing facility yet made
available primarily for education and basic research. IBM not only
will install the machine =~ in special space in M.I.T.'s new Karl
Taylor Compton Laboratory - but will contribute the cost of main=-
