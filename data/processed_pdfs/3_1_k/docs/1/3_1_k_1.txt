_ Dear Phils

~p oe

¥ am “enclobing a copy of a memo describing our

| time-sharing subscription line proposal, a copy of our memo

to the M.I.T, Audit Division deseribing our time~accounting

procedures, and a requisition from Records Processing and

Studies for one double rate time-sharing line. Since the
whole idea of selling computer service is quite new to me,’

I am not sure what the proper procedures are. I hope that

this requisition and these memoranda, with the further note
that the accounting transfers should be to account 7634, is
sufficient to get all the machinery in motion. |

At the end of each month I will send you, or
whonever you designate, a copy of the computer time used by
Records Processing and Studies, or any future subscribers,
in a form which, I hope, you will be able to use for billing.
The subscribers themselves will also get a copy of this
report.
If there seems to be anything we are not doing
scecording to Institute rules or something we are doing that
won't work, would you please let me know &s soon as possible.

As a metter of fact, if we seem to be doing things right, I

would appreciate hearing that also. Thank you for your help
in this matter. |
Yours truly,
