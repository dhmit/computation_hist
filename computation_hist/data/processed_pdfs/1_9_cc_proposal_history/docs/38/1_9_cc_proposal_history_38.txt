MIT DIGITAL COMPUTING EQUIFMENT REQUIREMENTS

BACEGROUND
A. Btatistical Services

1. The Card Programmed Calculator (CPC) hes been used a total
of 3708 hours during the period January 1 ~ November 15, 1854.
(Aversge = S81 hours per week).

2. The CPC hes been used 629 hours during this period on a "free
time” basis.

3. All work performed by Statistical Services prsonnel is charged
to the customer.

4, Ths CPC maintenance, down, and service time during this period
was 346 hours, or about 8% of the svailable time.

8. The CPC machine usage charge is $15.00 per hour,

6. Approximately 50% of the CPC programming ig done on & Ls
service basis.

7. A second CPC was installed at the Instrumentation Laboratory
(for their own use) on June 1, 1284, and it has since been
used exclusively for thelr work,

8. A Type 650 Magnetic Drum Calculator was ordered in December, 18853,
and it is to be delivered to the Instrumentation Laboratory (for
their exclusive use) in June, 1955 unless the Adainistration
decides otherwise before that time.

B. Whirlwind Project (Wil)

All Wl machine time has been free during the same period
(January 1 - Hovember 15, 1954); howsver, it has mow been
placed on & partial pay-as-you-go plan effective Kovember 18th.

An hourly machine usage rate of $250 per hour has been established.

WWl supervision, administration and some programming service is
still free.

WWi Sgientific and Engineering Applications Group consists
of 34 people, representing an A annual salary cost of $134,000.

WWl users are expected to program thelr own problems whenever
possible.


6. WWl has been used 8 total of 1745 houra during this period
{average = 38 hours per wesk) for non-Lincoln applications.

7. Wwl installation, test, and maintenance time has been averaging
64 hours per week, or about 46% of the available time.

8. As a result of the decision to charge for time on WW1, the
usage has decreased by 50%. This trend may or may not be
significant.

13. INSTITUTE CQMPUTATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

The computational activities psriormed on WWl and Statistical Services
equipment during the past year serve as @ basis for estimating the future
digitel computer requirements within the Institute. The following tabulation
reveals the average monthly machine usage im verious categories.

Note: Table I does not reflect any of the analogue computer activity at
M.I.T. When DACL, etc. are no longer available, the digital computer
requirements will naturally increase.

The following four subjects are the only Institute subjects vhich make
active use of electronic digital computers for classroom teaching:

6.28 Machine -Aided Analysis :

6.5356 Introduction to Digital Computer Coding and Logic
6.538 Rlectronic Computational Laboratory

16.91 Aerocelasticity

A proposed subject in Management Information Systems is to be given in the
School of Industrial Management (8.1.M.) for the first time in the Spring

Term 1988. This subject will illustrate the use of digital computers as a

tool of business managnent. A list of related subjects which make occasional
use of the facilities is given in Appendix (page v). Naturally, such participa-
tion would bo materially increased if equipment were available on a gratis basis.


III. POSSIBLE INM MACHINE INSTALLATIONS
There are at least 3 levels of IBM mechanimation which should be
examined as part of the M.I.T. long-range computational program. Although

a detailed breakdown of the individual machine components, rental costs,

space requirements, ete. is given in the Appendix, the following tabulation
serves to cumeaize the pertinent facts.

A consideration of the above rental costs reveals the following
"sale price” based on 2 3-year smortimation period:

CPC = $101,183
660 = $183,132
708 = $938,232

IBM supplies 3 Customer Engineers with each rented 705.


IV. BUGGESTIONS AND RECGRMENDATIONS

1. Dstermine the installation site (Instruzentation Laboratory or
Statistical Services) of the Type 650 Colculator which is to be
delivered in June, 1985.

2. Approach the IBM Corporation via top-level Administrative channels
concerning the equipment shown in Table II.

3. Statistical Services must have an internally-stored programmed
calculator for MIT use on non-classified work, e.g. the EEN
Type 708 or the 850 Calculator.

if neither of these is economically feasible, then the
purchase of a CRC 1030 or a Consolidated Drum Cslculator ghould
be considered.

4. Although the decision reached on the above will determine the
| actusl computer space reguirements, it is now imperative that space
be elliocated for computational equipment.

6, The fertheoming availability of the new Vhirlwind Computer (WWII)
early in 1855 will eliminate the present Lincoln Laboratory use
of WWl. It is estimated that it will cost $300,000 per year to
operate WWl as an HIT facility. A decision should now be made
regarding the disposition of WWl and its associated effect on the
MIT computational program.

6. It must be emphesized that the NIT requirements for large computers
(700 series) is increasing because of the future research in Atoms
for Pesce, business spplications, industrial lieison, etc. programs.
