the theory of compilers

Une group felt it premature to talk about those areas in the field where
the theory is not yet developed, as for example, the lack of a theory of compilers,
and they felt that there was still inadequate content for a proven discipline. Some
of the difficulty in idemtifying the field was because it is so widely disciplinary.
We must remain close to the academic disciplines because the work is worthy of
this identificaticn and maust not be a victim of ingrown professionalism.

A gecond group pointed out that some new entities such as list processing
languagees had been introduced by the advent of computers, that existing subjects
such as logic had been influenced, and that there were critical needs for the new
work being doue in computer research. The question of whether there was a
separate department for this work right now was not as important as that it should
be ingured that existing departinent boundaries don't restrict it «« that research in
computation should not be compared with research other than computation.

Some felt that to accomplish this, there was the need for some kind of academic
entity for students to join in, and that without such an entity, it was not possible to
build up the student body in this arez at all levels that are needed and that you would
like to have to insure unrestricted development of computer science. In one univers
gity the department of applied mathematics has been broadened to include computer
science, At a second, four departments have joined in steering towards an intere
departmental center. Degrees will be granted in one of the four departments upon
completion of a set of requirements defined by the center and upon the recommendation
of the center., This avoids the problems of isolation and rejection by other departments

as well as the problems of pigeonholing of credits by schools,

One university will introduce a master's program in computer information
gciences with new courses this year, They plan on gradually going to a separate
department with a doctoral program., Their feeling was that there was a whole
fabrication of techniques ignored by existing departments. They made 2 distinction
between analytic methods used to study natural languages in linguistics and the
symthetic methods of mechanical and programming languages in computer sciences,
between analytic methods in existence proofs in numerical analysis as belonging to
traditional mathematics and algorithme in numerical analyeis as a part of the come

puter sciences.
