Dear Bill:

On July first we are activating the M.I.T. Computation
Center, It will have Somewhat the same status as the Center for
International Studies, like a department in being able to make
appointments but not having its own Students.

I wonder whether we should have & separate book budget?

- The books so far bought by math and physics in this field are in

the Science Library and many of them would 8â‚¬1ll be desired by
physics or mathematics, Just the Same, should we have a small
but separate account? Does the Center for International Studies?

yours,

Philip M, Morse, Director
M.I.T. Computation Center
