Neer Frank:

Thanks very mach for your memo of the 30th on the office
of atatisticsl cepvices. Ib is a thoughtful statement
of the problems involved in the contemplated move to
Building 20, end unhappily T must concede that most of
your grguments are welletalken.,

his is one of phose difficult problems of administration
for which no aplution 18 wholly satisfactory, and the best
thet one can do 1g to try tO minimize the damegos. in

final decision to go anead with the Move 1 have been

ded, as you know, OF gertaln long-term plans for the
atiligetion of these central buildings which give first
priority to educational gotivities = and particularly to
undergraduate education,

1 am very cognlgani of the additional tneonveniences that
these changns MEY cause to the users of your Services, but

I em confident thet as the nature of the problem 18 made
clear to our administrative of flcers, you will find complete
cooperation tn an offord to make the plan Works Your memo

1s most helpful in drawing attention to specific aifficalties
that will have te be ironed oule

there is only one gonelusion in your memo that I feel 1b
necessary ic peconsiders On Page 5 you indicate that each
administrative office should provide 1s own courler and
transportation medium, 1 fear that this would causs a
considerable smount of duplication and would prove
impracticable. As @& workable alternative I pelieve thab
the TeSeDe should employ 8&8 full-time messenger with &

guitable means ni transporting the material. With proper

scheduling 7 imagine that he would be able tc meet the
requirements of all users of the Services. The co8US would,
