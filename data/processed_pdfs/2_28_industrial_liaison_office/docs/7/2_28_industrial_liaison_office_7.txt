Dear Frank:

As you know, the Industrial Liaison Office publishes annually

"a Directory of Current Research which lists all unclassified M.I.T.

. pesearch activities, both new end continuing projects. In compiling

this Directory we rely heavily upon the officially designated Depart-
mental and Lab representatives. ; =

You were good enough to execute & work sheet for us on the Com-
‘putation Center last year. May I presume upon your good will to ask
you once again to represent the Center in this work. I am enclosing
ten (10) blank work sheets and also the information which you com-
pleted for us last year for your reference. You may wish to simply
indicate that the three projects 1isted for the Computation Center

are continuing. An extra supply of blank forms is available if needed.

- Thank you in advance for your good help. I will call you in two

weeks to check your progress.
Since F
