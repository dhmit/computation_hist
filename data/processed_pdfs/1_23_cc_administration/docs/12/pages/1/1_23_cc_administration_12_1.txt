PROPOSAL FOR NSF GRANT TO SUPPORT COOPERATIVE PROGRAM
FOR NEW ENGLAND CCLLEGES
FOR RESEARCH AND EDUCATION IN MACHINE COMPUTATION

 

Background -~ Last year 27 colleges and universities in
New England %egan a cooperative program of training and research in
digital computer use using the facilities and staff of the Computation
Cen:er at M.I.T. IBM contributed the machine, a 704, and the main-
tenance staff, M.IL.T. provided most of the supervisory and faculty
sta:’f, the other colleges. contributed facully time of various amounts.

The results of this cooperative effort are promlsing. Two
ful. . -length courses in machine programming (two weeks, 8 hours each
day have been given, each to classes of 120-150 of students and
faculty members of the cooperatlng colleges; several shorter courses
have been given, at M.I.T. and at some of the otfher schools. During
the 8 months since the 704 has been in operation, problems in the
fol .owing subjects have been put on the machine:

Aerodynamics Languages

Antropology Mathematics

Astronomy Mechanical Engineering
Business Problems Medicine

Chemistry Metallurgy

Chemical Engineering Meterology

Civil Engineering Naval Architecture
Education Nuclear Engineering
Economics Operations Research
Electronics Physics

Electrical Engineering Psychology

Geology Public Acmlnls‘ranion

(Details of these problems are given in the latest semi-annual
vepcrt, of January, 1958)

At present. (February 1958) about 150 problems are active,
of which about 100 are from M.I.7.. 50 from the other cooperating
instltutions. The number of active problems is increasing rapidly and
the oroportion of problems from the other institutions is also
increasing. At present the single-shift (5 days a week) operation is
runring at about 80 per cent of capacity. In the near future, Saturdays
will be made operating days and in the spring we will have to go to
two-3hift operation.
