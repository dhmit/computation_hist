Saturday, July 28. Similarly, Eopley, et a1, will meet at EIT on F'riday,

July 27, to help- formulate the program for the 704 course. Finally, infomation
concerned with real estate -- furniture, equipment requirements, etc., will

be compiled during the next two weeks in order that orders may be pluced,
