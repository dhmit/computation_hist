Dear Professor Morse:

I would like to call your attention to the
second National Bureau of Standards-National Science
Foundation Training Program in Numerical Analysis
which will be held in Washington during the spring
term of 1959. This training program offers university
computing centers an ideal opportunity to send key men
for advanced training in problems of numerical analysis
and in the running of a computation laboratory.

I have enclosed the details of this training
program and hope that you will consider it in the

light of your personnel requirements.

Very truly yours,

/{LL% & prois

Philip J. Davis
Chief, Numerical Analysis
