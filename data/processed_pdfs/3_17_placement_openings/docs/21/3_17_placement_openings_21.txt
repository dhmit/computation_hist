Dr. Barnaby C. Keeney
~ President, Brown University
Providence 12, Rhode Island

Dear Dr. Keeney:

1 am pleased to enclose a check for $1, 350. 00 for the second
semester portion of the Brown University appointments to the M.I. T.
Computation Center as described on the attached sheet. The IBM
Corporation is very grateful for the work of the Research Associates
and Assistants in the program, for they have contributed a great deal to
its success.

There are now thirty-four colleges and universities in New
England participating with M.I.T. in the Computation Center. The new
IBM 709 has been in operation for four months, and already seventeen of
the colleges have made use of it. For your information, I am enclosing
a table of usage for the months September - December, 1960.

I am delighted that the Center at M.1.T. continues to supplement
your own computing facilities, and I certainly congratulate you on your
handsome 7070 installation. All of us in IBM are glad that we can have a
part in your educational program in the computation field.

Sincerely yours,

M. Loren Bullock
