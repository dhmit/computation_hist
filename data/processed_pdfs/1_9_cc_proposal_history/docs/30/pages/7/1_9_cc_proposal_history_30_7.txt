"~ (though this might be reduced to 7 to 12, including maintenance
technicians, since it would not have to carry the Registrar's
and Bursar's load). Statistical Services would remain as it
is now, a purely IBM unit, servicing the Institute's manage-
ment offices and the DIC projects, and The educational unit
would be s separate outfit. Such an arrangement would, of
course, be more costly than the other two possiblilities.

on - In a case, no matter which of the alter-

g:ﬁczzggndﬁafmi out to gg most feasible, it is important that
steps be taken to provide computing machine time for instruc-
tional and educational research purposes within the next
year. The Institute cannot be said to be doing its educa-
tional job in this field adequately unless at least one
high-speed machine and one intermediate machine are avall-
able for such purposes. It is recommended that the suggested

alternatives be investigated in the near future and an»
early decision reached as ©o which plan ©o push.
