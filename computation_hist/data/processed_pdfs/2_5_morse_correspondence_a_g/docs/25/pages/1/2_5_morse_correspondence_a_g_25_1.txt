Deer Frank:

Enclosed is a schedule for the entertainment of approximately
thirty economists of the hoard Reserve Banks of the United
States who in some sort of s oonvontion in Boston are coming
to H. I. T. on the warning of Monday, May 13, under the spon-
sorship of Hr. Welles. Dickson whom I understand to be the
Director of Public Information of the Federal Reserve Bank

of Boston. The schedule up through 10:30 is firm, also from
12:00 m. to 1:30. There remains the period in between which
I have listed on the enclosed schedule as for the Soholl E0012:
in Building 52 from lame to 11:50 in your charge.

Should the computer ”701;“ which was our original objective be
in any condition to shoe them, this schedule can have their
10:1“) destination changed accordingly, and it would then be
essential only to get them to the Faculty Club in time to
start lunch st 12:00.

It is my understanding that if “701;” is not in shape at that
time, you or someone provided by you will endeavor to engage
this group in informative conversation of some sort in the
Schell Room for the period indicated.

The telephone commotion by which I contact Dickson is HAnoook
6-7100, and I think it would be first rate if you can find

out from him more about the capacities of these people and
what can be best done for them. Your assumption of this nebu-
lous assignment is much appreciated.

Sincerely yours,

John ‘73. H. Bunker
Adviser to the President
