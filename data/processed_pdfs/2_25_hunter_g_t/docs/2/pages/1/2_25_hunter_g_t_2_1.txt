Dear Phil,

I have just received the semi-annual Report #2 from the MIT
Computation Center,

I am very pleased to see the wide variety of problems which
have already been put on the 704, and I am even more pleased
to see the good diversification of their sources to so many of
the other cooperating schools.

I shall look forward to an even more impressive report on the
next six months as you have more operating experience with
the 704.

My very best wishes to you and your associates there at MIT.
I hope I shall have the pleasure of talking with you again in

the near future and hearing more of the outstanding work being
done at MIT in the field of computation.

Sincerely yours,

e
Wa/‘/‘/
