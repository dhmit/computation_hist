3-178 describes the principles of the marginal

checking system which is built into the
‘ Whirlwind 1 computer.

'8-184~ covers some preliminary results of our
studies of vacuum tube life. The work of
the laboratory on protecting of. vacmn
tubes, on establishing conditions for longer
life and on the development of testing pro-
cedure such as marginal checking [or the
detection or deteriorating components has
attracted widespread favorable comment {rots
the Various electronic activities.

Project Whirlwind Smmsry Reports 21 and 22 and

Air Traffic Control Project Summary Reports 3 and L
are examples of the quarterly reports which
we have been submitting under our two contracts.

The Air Traffic Smary Reports will to con-
cluded rith no. 5, not being printed, since

the project has been redirected to work {or

the Volley Conittee.

Reports by the laboratory seen to be in considerable demand
by outside organizations. A count of the six months from September 1
191.9 to March 1, 1950 shared 9!. separate requests Iron [.8 different
orgsniutions for 1 total of 670 reports. These are ell specific re-
quests And do not include the regular nailing of about 200 copies or
such quarterly report. 0! the 1.8 orgsniutione, 20 were government

agenciee, 9 were universities, and the remaining 19 were commercial
estehlishnente.

Also included is a cc;~y of a letter which I prepared a
ten weeks ago {or Dr. Strstton. There has been considerable criticism
fun time to time, especially from persons interested exclusively in

lethal-tied spplicetione of dip-ital computers, of the short register
