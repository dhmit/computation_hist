faculty members who desired to use the equipment for
research in their own specilal fields. This researche-
educational-consulting staff should provide the "impedance
mateh” between the machines znd the research worker in
any of the flelds of the physical or social sciences, of
engineering or of administrative practice. And the machine
and staff must be set up and financed in a way so that
access to the machine and to the advice of the stalf will
be free to those students and faculty members who have a
worth-whille research problem which requires computational
assistance appropriate for machine aclution.

Arrangements with I.B.M. Corporation -~ Diaoussiona.
with Dr. Cuthbert Hurd of the International Bue iness
Machines Corporation (IBM) and, later, with Mr. Thomas J.
Watson, Jr., President of the Corporation, showed that
IBM was aware of these educational problems and was willing
to contribute toward their solution. With their enlight-
éned and forward-looking aid a contract was negog¢lated
between IBM and MIT by whiegh:

1) An IBM 70% plus its auxiliary equipment is given,
rent free to MIT, to be installed in the new Compton
Laboratories at the Institute, IBM to provide maintenance
and two operators per ghift. On the average, one shift
will be for the use of students and staff of MIT, one
shift for the use of other colleges and universities in
New England, cooperating in the use of the equipment
(the cooperating institutions) and, for the time being, the
