A second approach is to make computers easier to use by simultaneous
computer time-sharing by several users. The complexities of such

systems are largely unexplored but advantages are exciting. Typical
applications might be several real-time program testing stations, each
with a private debugging console, thus giving a programmer time to
think on his feet without wasting valuable machine time. Such stations
could of course be located remotely in various departments at M.I.T
or even, in principle, at the New England colleges. Finally, special
demonstration consoles would be available in lecture halls for man-

Present Status

As mentioned above, the number of users from M.I.T. are currently
saturating the allotted time and any reasonable projection indicates a
