Dec:- Poul:

In cocci-lune. with your recent request, I hove prepared a memo
60-10 which lists the office equipment roquirenents tor the MIT Computation
Center. This list in a sense in not caplet. since it does 1‘22 list all. 0:!
oi the equipment in the 704 root and the 650 und I“ cross. However, since
III has cared to beer n11 of those costs, we are not too concerned. An
emintion o! the contract with In indicutos thnt they would turnish the
equipmnt in the following most

5. 7“ Reception Area Room 152

6. Dark Room Room 969A

7. an Area Room 058

8. 118 Customer Engineering loom 160

However, I should mention that in some or our informal discussions
with Peyson Hunter it was indicated that perhaps the Computation Center
Headquarters and a. few other areas night be serviced by XII tor compatibility
reasons -- iron the aesthetic ofﬁce appearance viewpoint. Prof. Horse and
I thought that we might consider asking III to furnish the entire first floor

in addition to their commitments to furnish the Dark Roe- and EA! area. in the
basement.
