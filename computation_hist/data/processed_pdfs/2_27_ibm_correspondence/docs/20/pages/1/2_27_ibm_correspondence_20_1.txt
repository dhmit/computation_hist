Dear Professor Morse:

Thank you very much for the information contained in your letter of
February 7, 1957 covering the amounts and the payees for the IBM
research appointments at the IBM Computation Center for the remaining
portion of this academic year. Checks to cover these payments are
being forwarded to the participating universities.

At this time I would like to extend my thanks for the excellent job that you
and your staff have done in getting this activity under way. The progress
has been very encouraging and we are looking forward to a very success—
ful program.

Cordially yours,
