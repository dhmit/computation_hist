8. Section D and E

During the second quarter we have completed production runs for the
following parameters:

M=2 all values of RHO

M= g 0 e "o

=8 M 1" "o

]/2: 3]/2/ 2

for two values of C: 2

 

We are now trying to modify the program so that the case M = 1 can

be run and the sum of Q be computed analytically.
