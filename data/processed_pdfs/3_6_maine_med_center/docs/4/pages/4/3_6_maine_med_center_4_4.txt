practice, E was computed by taking the ratio of small incrementsof V and L,and

FIGURE 5. Field- and boundary-potential distributions in a 2-dimensional thorax section
for a g angle of 90°. Figure @ shows the homogeneous section; in b the spine and sternum
sections are completely insulating, and the lungs havea resistivity ratio of 4 and in ¢ the lung
sections are also completely insulating. The broken curves in the right-hand illustrations
show the distribution of potential gradient around the boundary.

the conductivity, the potential-gradient curves also are proportional to the
variation of current intensity along the boundary. As is obvious from FIGURE
Sa, E is greatest near the center of the front of the section.

FIGURE 5b shows the field when insulating spine and sternum sections and
lung sections with a resistivity four times as great as that of the main body of
