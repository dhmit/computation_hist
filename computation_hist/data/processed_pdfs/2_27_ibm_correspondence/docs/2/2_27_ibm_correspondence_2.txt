Dear Dr. Johnson:

It is with a gress deal of pleasure that I enclose our check
for ยง1,500.00 representing the first semester portion of the stipend
for the IBM Research Associate recently appointed for the 1959-60
school year in connection with the M.1.T. Computation Center. A
detailed description of the appointment is attached.

The increasing use of the IBM 704 Computer at M.I.T. by
the New England colleges both as an educational device and a research
tool has been very encouraging to IBM, and we are delighted that the
University of New Hampshire is having an active part in it as
represented by this research appointment.
