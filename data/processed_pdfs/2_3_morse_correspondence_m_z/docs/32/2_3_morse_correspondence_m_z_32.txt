I trust ju finally got home from Washington. My plane just made it
to Laguardia as the weather closed in.

The Clebsh-Gordan picture looks rather grim. Say 1 and 1' are to be
combined to give L. Then for given magnetic quantum numbers m and m'
as well as for a given 1 and 1' there are a total of

(1+1') [men + 4

possible L's. This expression must be summed on m: |m{€ 1, and m':
[m'] 1', and then summed on 1 and 1' from zero to some maximum value
which we ’ wish to include in the table.

The leading term in the resultant sum goes as 1° (sob). A fractional
coefficient in front of this term can be gained by taking account of

the various symmetries of the C.-G.'s but this is immediately obliterated
as soon as you include half-integer angular momenta.

Did I hear somebody say Yn 30?
Nick sends his warmest regards.

P.S. There exists a "Numerical Table of the C.-G. Coefficients" by
Albert Simon, Oak Ridge: ORNL-1718, up to 1l=1'=9/2. This seems
good enough for most problems feasible without a high speed
computer.
