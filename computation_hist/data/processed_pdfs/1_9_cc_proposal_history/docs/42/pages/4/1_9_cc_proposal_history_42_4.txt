of about a.million dollars
(they expect to amortize their machines in about 4 years) tho

thelr actual donation would be congiderably less than this if they

IBM 18 very much interested in supporting research and
education in categories 8, b and ¢ mentioned above, particularly
in category ¢. The Institute 1s, at present, in the forefront
in categories a and b and 1is rapldly drawing to the fore in cate-
gory ¢. Dr. Cuthbert Hurd, head of Research for IBM, in a conference
wlith Carl Floe and Phil Morse, has shown considerable interest in
our plans for education and research in all three categories. It

18 quite reasonable to expect them to contribute to our efforts in
this direction. |
