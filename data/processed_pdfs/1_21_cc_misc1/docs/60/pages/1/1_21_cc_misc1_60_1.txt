Dear Ray:

, | Just a postsceript to our discussion of the

shortage of "mathematical physicists" and others who
are willing to stray fÂ£rom the "fasionabie line". I'm
sure you:know the real  reason for the shortage. No
department encourages anyone, faculty or gtudent, to
stray from the "fashionable line" because 1t knows 1%
can't get finanecial support for anythlng away from the
"Pashionable line". You know the sort of treatment
I've been getting from NSF and others in trylng to get
support for an "inbetween field". Can you blame me if
I warn young students away from this rat-race?

- Yours,
