REQUEST CARDS

Programmers who have special tapes to be mounted should
note that these tapes will be mounted exactly as they were
left from the previous run. That is, if they were to be
file protected at the end of the last run, they will be file
protected at the beginning of this run and if they were not
file protected at the end of the last run they will not be
file protected at the beginnning of this run,

Note that a file protected tape is one which can be
read, but not written, whereas a tape which is not file
protected can be both read and written.
