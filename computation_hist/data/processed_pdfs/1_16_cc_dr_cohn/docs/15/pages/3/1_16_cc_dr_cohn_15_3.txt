bodv K (or vice versa) if no point of the lattice except the origin is interior
to K. The convex body which we use is the rectangular parallelepiped:

The lattice we use can be written as

THEOREM. Every lattice has a Minkowshian triple that serves as a basis.

We call this a Mirilcowslcian basis and proceed from there.
