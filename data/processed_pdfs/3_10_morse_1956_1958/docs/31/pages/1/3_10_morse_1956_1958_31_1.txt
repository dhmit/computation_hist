Dear Carl:

The more I see of 701 and 704 installations, the more
I'm convinced that quieting the air conditioning 1s not a wminor
problem but a really serious one, that it will require careful
treating of the ducts and probably also the individual wachines
if the words "demonstration area" and "instructional pmrposes"”
are to be other than a mockery. I also hear that the architects
have not yet consulted with Bolt, Beranek and Newman about this
pre:lem, n spite of the faect that Peterson suggested this two
months age.

If the main computer roow ends up like the ones I've
seen, with poorly designed duct-work and no treatment arcund the
units giving rise to 70-90 db background, I'm goling to refuse to
accept the installation until it is fixed--and fixing badly designed
ducts iz always expensive!l

Can you see whether B, B &énd N can be called in before
it is too late?

Tours,
