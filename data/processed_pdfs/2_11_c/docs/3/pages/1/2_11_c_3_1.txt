Dear Professor Morse:

I have posted your letter of December 10 in our laboratory
here and announced it to my students. As I wrote you, I am also
looking for persons with the characteristics you describe for our
new staff at Chapel Hill.

I have suggested to Mr. Paul Anderson, one of the students
who has served as an IBM-650 operator and programmer here, that
this might interest him. You may also hear from other students
in my class.

If in turn, you know of any students who would like to get \
Ph.d's in computer oriented mathematics aimed at artificial intel-
ligence, language translation, or numerical analysis, I would be
pleased to hear from them at Chapel Hill. =
