Dear Professor Morse,

Plans for the meeting of college publicity here on
January 9 and 10 are proceeding smoothly, and I'm pleased
that we can count on showing those concerned with it the
Computation Center end the cooperative program with New
Enplnnd colleges. I have this down for 11:50 on Thursday
morning, Jenuery 9; we will have lunch at 1:15 at the

Faculty Club, so you have as long as until 1 o'clock if you
went it.

I shall try to hold attendance to a small number, so that

you can handle the whole group together. To this end, 1 3‘)
think I should have a list of colleges which are now par— ““

ticipating in the cooperetive program —and which have done
so and may soon do so again. Then before we let others

attend the meeting I can at least be sure that representa~

tives of these schools are eccommodated.

We'll be sendine out preliminary informetion in shout a
week, end I'd be glad to have the list before then if it
can be arranged. Do you want me to send any other in—
formetion ehout the Comoutntion Center to particioants
at this stese, to save you some time next month?.
