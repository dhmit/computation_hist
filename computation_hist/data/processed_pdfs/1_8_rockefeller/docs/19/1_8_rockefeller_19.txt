Dear Dr. â€˜Buchanan; :
Thank you very much for your letter of October 31.
1 am sorry to say that I will be out of town next
Thursday and Friday when you are in Cambridge. However, I
do plan to call you Wednesday evening at the Commander to
talk briefly with you about our proposal and to make
arrangements for you to see other people on the project here.
I hope that your visit here will be both informative
and clarifying.
Sincerely yours,

Philip M. Morse, Director
