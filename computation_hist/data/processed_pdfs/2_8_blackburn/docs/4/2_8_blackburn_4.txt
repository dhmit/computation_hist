Dear Professor Morse:

In order for the IBM administrative and Customer Engineering
personnel involved to be adequately informed, I should like to request
that MIT notify either Dr. R. N. Johanson or Mr. C. J. Skolfield as
far in advanced as possible of any anticipated use of the 704 Computation
Center outside of the normal scheduled hours.

In the past, the machine has been turned on on Saturdays other
than the regularly scheduled Saturdays for out of town users without the
knowledge of anyone within IBM. It seems to me essential that our
Customer Engineering personnel be alerted when the machine is to be
turned on so that they can be on call in case they are needed. It is also
important that the administrative personnel involved be aware of the machine
operation. I am sure that if either Dr. F. M. Verzuh or Mr. William
Thur ston can notify one of the above named persons prior to any
additional operation of the machine, it will add materially to the smooth
operation of the Computation Center.

Thank you very much for your co-operation in this matter.

Yo ery truly,

(EF Blackburn
