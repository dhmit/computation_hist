y' The Office of Naval Peagarch lrg been part-
{anlaprly interedted when exfending aurrent

 

di projects to take inte seonunt expected bal-
E- ances from current funds sg of the dave off the
fi beginning of the extension. It would appear

fpom a atudy of the current balance in these
two projects that extrapolatlon of current
antag of expenditurs would leave rather large |
wynexpendsed balances as of June 30, 1955. ~
hana balanced should be subtracted from funds
needed to run from the peried July 1, 1055 to
June 30, 1956. -If the reasaroh should be
anrrisd on at an agcelerated rate 5@ that eX-
pendd tures would use up the current funda by
June 30, 1955, we should give an explanation
of such of an expansion in the prograi.
