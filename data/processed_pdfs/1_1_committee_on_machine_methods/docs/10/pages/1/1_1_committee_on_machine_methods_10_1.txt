Kopal reported that the situation was not yet clear aboub
Verzuh or Salzer., The Comxmittee felt that Verzuh should teke
139 this term, bub Verzuh hes not yet gotien clear snough of his
various duties to be eble to carry this and teach his course and
teke M39 and do his thesis. Nevertheless the Committee felt 1t
was bebter for him to sign up for M39 now and to work toward a
lightening of his duties; if this turns out to be jmposaible, to
cancel M30 later. It appeers only to welt action by Stratton to
cloor the matter up. In Salzer's cese his supervisory committeo

{s meoting today end should cleer up his questions.
