regard to the rational singularities of F,,(z), but we shall not even attempt
by a term by term analysis to explain how G2m(2) can vanish identically zs
it does when m =2,3,4,5,or7. We shall, therefore, have to rely’ on
function-theoretical as well as analytic methods, expressing Poincaré theta
functions in terms of the better known elliptic modular function J(z).

We shall see that the results applying to Fyn(z) and Gam(2) are just
special cases of results for general theta functions, which we shall establish

presently. We shall also see that the asymptotic behavior, to a certain
extent, can describe the function and the singularity.

3. Preliminary results on theta functions. We shall now collect some
results on the convergence of Poincaré theta functions. These results are
either proved in the literature or are immediate consequences of such results.

The modular group defined in 1 is generated by the substitutions
2—>2z-+ 1and z— —1/z. It has a fundamental domain D consisting of the
region ®* of the upper half plane defined by the inequalities |z| > 1 and
| Rz | < 3, together with the boundary points of ®* identified according
to the two transformations z—2 4+ 1 and 2——1/2. Every point z of the
upper half plane is equivalent, modulo the modular group, to a single point
in the fundamental domain ©. (The point at infinity, being a boundary
point, is excluded from the upper half plane.)

We define the elliptic modular function, with Dedekind, as the function
J(z) which maps the fundamental domain onto the whole z-plane so that
J(o) =00, J(t) =1, and J(3(1 4 1V3)) =0. The mapping function,
J(z) by virtue of the shape of the fundamental domain, will take on the
value unity twice at z =1, and will have a triple zero at z=3(1 4 ©V3).
As 3z becomes infinite, J(z) likewise will behave like

(exp — Rariz) (ko + ky exp 2miz + ko exp 4miz 4+ *).

The exact value of k,, namely 1/1728, can not be immediately inferred from
the shape of the fundamental domain, but we shall concern ourselves only
with the more evident fact that ko, 5= 0. From its definition, J(2) is invariant
under the modular group. It can be further shown that any single-valued
