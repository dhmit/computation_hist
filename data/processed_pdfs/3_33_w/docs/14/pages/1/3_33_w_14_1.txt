Dear Professor Morse:

This letter is to inquire about the use of the computation center by the
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Close contact with the meteorology
department and others at M.I.T. over a period of years, through joint semi-
nars on ocean and atmospheric circulations, have suggested that machine
computation could be extremely important in oceanographic research.

There are two principal categories of machine problems under consideration
here. The first consists of numerical investigation of theoretical models of
ocean circulations, tidal oscillations and processes in which the atmosphere
and ocean interact with one another. The second category is to explore methods
of using a machine for statistical analysis of surface and deep water oceanogra-
phic data.

A limited amount of work with automatic computation is already going on
here, but a more rapid expansion is being held up in part by a lack of experi-
ence in the field. In this respect participation by personnel here in working
with the M.I.T. computing center would be particularly valuable.

In particular Dr. Kirk Bryan, Jr., who has recently joined our staff, is
developing some specific problems in meteorology and oceanography that
appear to require the use of a large machine. He would like to visit with your
group in the near future to see if arrangements can be made for use of an M.I.T.
computer.

Sincerely yours,
