5 g The fOAnWiﬁs_ ,four- subjects are the only Institute subjects which make
' active use of electronic digital computers for classroom teaching: |

6.25 llachino-Aidod Analysis

6.535 Introduction to Digital Computer Coding and Logie
6.8386 Electronic Computational Laboratory

16.91 Aeroelasticity |

A proposed subject in Management Information Systems is to be given in the

School of Industrial Management (8.I.M.) for the first time in the Spring

Term 1955. This subject will illustrate the use of digital computers as a

tool of business managment. A list of related subjects which make occasional

use of the facilities is given in Appendix (page v). Naturally, such participa-
. tion would be materially increased if equipment were available on a gratis basis.
