Dear Mr, Lowe: A T et : P ,
. Thank you for your letter of November 1 cone j
cerning the poselbility of a talk on the appli-
cation of electronic computing equipment; for
interested students. As you may know, MIT has an
Interdepartmental Committee on Machine Computation
and Numerical Analysis under the Chairmanship of
Professor P.M. Morse of the Department of Physies.
Professor F.B. Hildebrand is one of the repre-
sentatives of the Mathematics Department on this
Committee and T am turning your letter over to
him with the suggestion that he discuss it with |
the Interdepartmental Committee. If that Committee
feels that it ecan arrange a talk of the type you
have in mind, Professor Hildebrand will write you
directly concerning detailed plans.

Very sincerely yours,

w. 57

W.T. Martin
