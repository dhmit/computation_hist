Dear Mr. Fri:

Thank you for your letter which Professor
Morse, as Director of the Computation Center, has forwarded
to me. I would like very much to talk to you about the
sub jeet of automatic programming and would particularly
like to have any material that you have available on
general concepts of information retrieval.

We have a seminar at the present time
conducted by Professor John McCarthy of Dartmouth, who
i8 visiting M.I.T. this year, on the subject of automatic
programming. Reproductions of these lectures are being
made and we will be happy to send you copies as they
become available.

T would like very much to arrange a meeting
with you in the near future with regard to these matters.

Sincerely yours,

Dean N. Arden
Director of Programming [esearch
Computation Center
