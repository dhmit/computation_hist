The Massachusetts Institute of Technology submits
herewith a'revised proposal for extension of the reference contract
to June 30, 1957 at an additional estimated seat of $20,960.00.

We understand that this proposal has been the subject of discus-
sions between Professor P. M. horse of MIT and Mr. A. J. Wise
of ONE—MIT, Dr. Carl F. Mukenheupt of omﬁpBoston, and Dr. F. J.

There follows a summary of expenditures and funds
remaining on the two projects, Whirlwind Operation and Machine
Methods of Computation, which are currently active under the

Project #63“: (Whirlwind Operation) has an unexpended
balance of $97,000 as of november 30. 1955. The current expendp
itures are approximately $10,000 per month. The’aversge "income"

per month -—

a net expenditure of $7,000‘per month. If it is assumed that the
present level of income ($3.000 per month) is maintained during
the nineteen-month period December 1, 1955 to June 30, 1957, a
minimum amount, assuming some tapering off, of $119,000 will be

However, for the purpose of establishin 'sn estimate of

it is esti-

mated that a higher level of income will exist during the remaining
seven months. This may average'eomething above $u,000 a month. On
this basis we estimate that $5?,000 or the $97,000 mentioned above
will remain unexpended as of June 30, 1956. An additional factor
affecting the budget shown on page E is the ettimatcd Computer
