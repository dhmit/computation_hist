Jroposed finmancing scheme for the new M.I.T. Computation Center

in viow of QNR's refusal to contribuis $30,000 to the
operation of the H.I.T. Computation Center, some other method
of obtaining funds must be devised. Several aiternative plans
2 available.

:

N I

 

A rate structure may be established which levies & charge
on personuel (at & xate 2 or 3 times pregent salary)} which is
ﬁesign@d to recover the opersting cost of the center. Since
the 704 machine is provided on a gratis basis, there would be
no machine charge. In this plan, it i1s of course possible to
solicit contributions from varicus M.I.T. prajects who are
currently contributing to the operation of Whirilwind. In this
nanner, monies would be received, operating persomnel would be
bired; however, nc single individual would be sssipned to 2
single sponsoring project. Thot is to say, the contribution by
3 project does not entitle them to the scle gervices of a
prrticular indivudusl. Thus a8 cosmon operating personnel pool
would be established to service gll projects on a eguitable basis

t3 D send one wan to the center to learn
to program gnd use the 704 Calculator. After the industrial
ropresentative had becom? proficient in the use of the compuier,
¢ would indeed be able to szolve occasional problems for his
company, thus providing them a return on thelr invegtment ($5,000
plus personnel sgigrv). In cthis wanner, 20 companies would
contribuies $100.000 to the operation of the center. We a@s 2n
educational institution would be providing a very effective liasison
with industry. Haturally such cooperastion will iead to new projects
and coentinued support. Covicusly, combinetions of Plan I spd IT
mey be used
