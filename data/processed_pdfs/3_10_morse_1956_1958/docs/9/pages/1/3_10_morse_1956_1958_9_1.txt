Subject: Summery Report of FREE Time Usage of the Whirlwind Computer during
the 12-fionth Period January 1 - December 31, 18066.

In accoxdance with our diacu:aio&s concerning the expected usage
of the 704 Calculator, I have prepared & 12-month summary of FREE time usage
of the Whirlwind Computer during the period January I -~ December 31, 1956,

it is of interest to note that ONR's '"'free tino" usage of Whirlwind
breaks down as follows:

Minutes ~ Dollar
Used Valuation
Machine Computation Committee 1,209.6 $.60,639.
Solid State and Molecular
Theory (Slater) 25,181 .4 103,417.
Miscellandous Projects 24,928.5 78,924 $212,979,

The total machine usage duwring this lz-month_ period for thiz type of work
was 51.319.5 minutes or approxzimately 855. 3 hours. I believe the
detailed breakdown contained on the attached aummarizing table == problen
vumber, title, programmer, supervisor, DSE contract, goverament contrect,
minutes used, and dollar value, provide useful statistics. The dollar value
igs based on an assumed rate of $250/hour -~ obviously we have not collected
thig money since it is "frse tine" usage.
