Dear Professor Kuh:

The purpose of this letter is to give you a written reply
to your request of November 19 in which you requested an additional
16 hours of machine time for problem M136.

As you well realize, the amount of time requested for this
problem is extremely high -~ in view of what use people are making.
Accordingly, the Review Board have met and very carefully deliberated
on your case. The question may be summarized as follows:

 

1, An additional 16 hours was approved for problem M136,

2. This grant was made only because of the special character
of your work -- the fact that you will be creating a
textbook containing the results of this study,

3. Further complicating factors were that Mr. Malcolm Jones
is leaving on December 5, and this work could only be
done while he is here,

= "UU Â© OO

Generally, we would not approve such a request and this is certainly

tobe considered a special case, and is not to be considered as
precedent setting.

I am glad to be able to inform you that special arrangements
have been made to run this problem on the midnight shift November 28,
anc on soveral evenings during the week of December 1 - 3.

Please make every effort to insure that the work done during
this period is correct, sence it is so easy to make errors with long
"production runs" being made,

Sincerely yours,
