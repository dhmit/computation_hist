Thu progrlm which can alsht wish to support can be divided
intc four sections:

1. Research in metheds at numerical analysis and the rerun-
latlon or scientific yroblams for machine solution, together with
support of training of students in these methods.

2. support of the scientific and engineering applications
group previously referred to with Projeat Whirlwind so a: to make
the VH computer useful and available for the &bove research, and
aid to the research being carried on by MIT faculty and students.

3. A partial support of the maintenance of the UV computer.

4. Research on an investigation of digital computing machine

camponents.

It is understood that details of the pro:7ram,wh1ch is
