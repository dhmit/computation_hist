describes some of their previous work related to this proposal.

Recommendation

It is proposed that $19,700 be granted for the 1957-58 yaar,
for work as outlined, and that discussions be commenced thi
summer or next fall for continuation of the work, at about the
same rate, through the year 1958-59, so that the senior staff
will not be lost to other projects because of uncertainties of
funding for the following year.
