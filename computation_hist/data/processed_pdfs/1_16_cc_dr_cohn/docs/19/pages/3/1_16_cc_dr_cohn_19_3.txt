dental By this method we can obtain some transcendental numbers

which seem to have previously escaped notice.

where M[¢(0)] is an integers If ¢(0)7€0, then the same inequality

the exponent 61.). Then of the coefﬁcients a.- in a'h(x) let gh be the
maximum [ail (gr; 1) and let (1;. be the least common multiple of
the denominators Si in «71.06). Then if as h—> cc, eh“ is of a higher order
of inﬁnity" than eh, log gr, and log dr, we ﬁnd that 0(x) is transcen-
dental for all algebraic x wilhin its circle of convergence, except x=0.
To see this, let x take the algebraic value 6 of degree it within a
circle of convergence of radius p. W’e suppose E(a) to be an arbitrary
polynomial of degree k with integral coefﬁcients of which the greatest
has the absolute value A [E(cr) ]. Then we wish to show E(a'(0)) #0.
First we write E(r7(x)) as partial sum and remainder

since any coefﬁcient in the polynomial ¢I.(x) is less than the value this
polynomial assumes when we replace each a.- by g and set x=1.

Furthermore, since E(o') has only a limited number of roots,
E(cr/i(0)) can not vanish for all h. For, when 11 changes to h+1, 071(0)
changes by ahHQ‘M‘, which approaches zero ash approaches inﬁnity,
although this term never vanishes, 0:0 having been excluded. Thus
by (5), for an inﬁnity of values of h,
