has ploneered a number of major new developments in machine
design and use. It was the first general purpose computer
to have magnetic core memory in routine use and its Pro=-
gramming research staff was the first to develop techniques
for making the machine do its bookkeeping and program
checking, by making avallable, for the general user a set
of utility assembly and post-mortern programs.

The Office of Naval Research supported this
development of ways to make Whirlwind easier to use and
of programs for the use of the computer in a wide variety
of appliications. Research Assistants, from nearly all
the departments at the Institute, worked with the fulle
time staff to make this broad advance possible. The
Guarterly Progress Reports, published by the Whirliwind
Projeet from to the end of this year, give
the details of the work.

Increase in Research and Educational Needs - To
supervise the general research and educational use of
Whirilwind I, the Institute set up in 1952 a working Committee
on Numerical Analysis and Machine Computation, composed
of faculty members from interested departments. This
committee has reviewed the instruetional courses, offered
at MIT, in this general field, and has recommended others
in order to widen the coverage. It undertakes to supervise
