limitations in both character font and in the rate at which
they can present information. Displays such as remote scopes
at present require a large amount of computer time tO main-
tain a display for a viewer. In addition, if a computer is
to be used as a classroom adjunct, it is necessary to make
both input and output of such a size and form as to be easily
viewed by a large group.

The other "Hardware" aspects of the general time sharing
problem pertain to the terminal connections between the com-
puter and the remote "consoles"; such considerations as the
maximum data rates that must be transmitted by such 1links.
There are, in addition, many general considerations such as
the need for a fairly large backup memory with a low access
time, and the need for non-interference between coexisting
programs that must be solved through changes in the logical
structure of the particular computer.

From a "systems" point of view, all of the remote con-
soles, input-output and backup storage devices must operate
in such a fashion that very little time is lost shifting
from one internally stored program (or a portion of that pro-
gram) to another. The decision making process that will in-
ternally direct the computer to heed one, out of many com-
peting users, without either wasting time or slowing down
any of the users poses a difficult problem, but that is well
on its way to solution. Each of the users, in addition,
must be able to use any of the present and future programming
languages such as Fortran, Comit, SAP, LISP, APT, etec. which
in turn requires that these programming systems be readily
available to any of the users.

The overall program to accomplish these objectives can
only be written after the particular machine configuration,
auxillary input-output devices and information processing
strategies have been decided.

Progress to date:

As of today, the project has accomplished the following:
