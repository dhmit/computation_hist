Dear Dr. Casagrande:

0 have to report that I will

be busy giving a special course at M.I.T. on
machine programming during the last two weeks of
August, so I will not be able to attend your
session on O.R. Otherwise I would have been
pleased to come; it looks like it will be an

interesting discussion.
Sincerely,

I am sorry t

Philip M. Morse
