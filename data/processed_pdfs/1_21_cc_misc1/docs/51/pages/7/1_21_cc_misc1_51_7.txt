Dear Alan:

A few weeks ago I got a letter from telling we a
request for funds I had put in last spr and had understood
was OK'd) was finally disaliowed., I'm not too upset, for tm
reqguest wasn't large and I guess I can squeak t i
would have he to have been told earlier. But I un pusslod, and
somewhat at a sc. And, if 1t's not improper of me, I'd like
advice., If 1t improper, let me knen ‘soon and I'li ask elsewhere.

We have & big eo-putor'up here -« the biggeat in the country
which is devoted exclusively to free science. IBM is contributing
a lot to its support and so is MIT. But we do need scientific
ataff to make it do what it ocught to do and I need additional cash
to pay them., I can go to some source (say the NSF) and ask for the
cashy but to do so I have to make my request "in proper form". And
to do that I have {0 atretch my story to exaggerate one or another
aspect, in order to get the request through one or another of the
different shaped slots which are bullt to receive requests. 1 can
slant 1t four different ways:

 

1. As an aid in education. BRach summer we glve programming
courses to students and faculty of the twenty-five participating
New England colleges. This spring I guess we will be running off
the caleculations for about thirty doctors theses and wore than a

bachelors and masters thesea. Next year it could be more
if our staff could handle the increassed amount of consultation on
programming it would involve. Each person who puts on a tough
problem needs personal help., We are rumning small classes in coding
