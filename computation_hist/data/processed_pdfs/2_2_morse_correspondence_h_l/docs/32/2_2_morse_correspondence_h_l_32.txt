Reflection and Transmission of Radiation by Metal Films and the Influence of
Nonabsorbing Backings*

(Received November 3, 1950)

A set of equations is presented for the reflection and transmission of normally incident radiation by

absorbing (metal) films on nonabsorbing backings.

Using these equations, the results of two different methods of calculation of the reflection and transmission
coefficients of a thick nonabsorbing plate are shown to be practically identical, both with and without an
“absorbing (metal) film on one surface of the plate. One of these methods involves the addition of intensities
of the multiple reflections from the two surfaces of the plate. The other method is a rigorous calculation
involving solution of the boundary condition equations (amplitude addition) for small areas followed by

intensity averaging over the whole plate.

In order to calculate optical constants of a metal film on a thick nonabsorbing backing, the much simpler
method of intensity addition of internal reflections in the backing may usually be applied.

 

INTRODUCTION

fae optical constants of partially transmitting

metal films may be determined by means of the
reflection and transmission measurements of nearly
normally incident radiation.!=® These metal films are
usually deposited on an optically nonabsorbing backing.
When the backing is very thin (of the order of the
wavelength of the incident radiation or less), its surfaces
are made optically parallel, and such backings may
exhibit interference phenomena. The results of the
derivation of expressions for the reflection and trans-
mission in terms of the optical constants of these sys-
tems are presented subsequently.

In the case of thicker backings there is a good deal of
disagreement between various authors*~7 about the
influence of the uncovered face of the backing on the
reflection and transmission. Customarily, multiple re-
flections from the two surfaces of the backing are con-
sidered, and the intensities of the beams emerging from
the two surfaces are added to find the reflection and
transmission coefficients of the system.

Intensity superposition is shown! to be justifiable
when the sources of the beams are incoherent. Koller?
and, more recently, Matossi® have pointed out that the

reflected and transmitted waves from the two surfaces
of a nonabsorbing plate are not necessarily incoherent.
Koller claims to demonstrate a difference between re-
sults of intensity addition and those of amplitude
addition, but this discrepancy is due to a mathematical
error in Koller’s analysis.

Since intensity addition is much more practical to
apply than is amplitude addition, and since it has been
widely used,®®7 an analysis of the accuracy of intensity
addition is presented below.

It appears that intensity addition is applicable for
sufficiently thick backings when either the thickness of
the backing or the wavelength of the incident radiation,
or both, has a sufficiently large range of probable values.

INTENSITY ADDITION

Without theoretical justification of intensity addition,
the customary method of dealing with thick backings is
given below.

The backing generally has two different parallel
surfaces, one of which is exposed to the air, while the
other one is covered by a thin metal film. The reflection
and transmission coefficients of these surfaces are de-
fined as follows:

AMPLITUDE ADDITION

When radiation coming from a metal film on a backing
is examined, the portion of the plate covered by one
observation is sufficiently large that the thickness of
the backing may vary over this area. Moreover, the
source of the radiation may contain a finite range of
wavelengths.

Since the reflection and transmission coefficients de-
pend on the thickness of the backing and on the

wavelength of the incident radiation, the experimental
observations represent average quantities covering a
range of wavelengths and thicknesses. 7

The dependence of reflection and transmission of a
metal-covered backing on wavelength and on thickness
of the backing is expressible in terms of a parameter
6—2mny(b/\), where ny=index of refraction of the
backing, b= thickness of the backing, and A= wave-
length, in vacuum, of incident radiation. In averaging
the reflection R(6) and transmission T(6) over 6, it is
necessary to know the weight to be given each value of
6. A distribution function f(6) is used to express these
weights; f(8) can be found when the relative intensities
of the different wavelengths of the source and also the
geometrical shape of the surfaces of the backing are
known.

The measured reflection and transmission are then
given by

R= | R(0)f(0)do; T= | 70) £(8)d0. (3)

The types of backings considered are those that satisfy
both of the following conditions:

(a) The curvature of the surface is small everywhere.
(b) The angle between the surfaces of the backing 1s
small.

These conditions eliminate, for instance, ground glass,
but include all backings commonly used; when the
shape of their surfaces is completely known, the dis-
tribution function for thickness can be found with the
following definition :

¥(b) is the fraction of the total area under observa-

tion whose thickness has a value between b and
b+-db.

Correspondingly, a wavelength distribution function is
defined :

¢(\) is the fraction of the incident radiation whose
wavelength lies between \ and A\-}dA.

Then the probability that a ray of wavelength between
A and A+d\ impinges on an element of the backing that

Since 8=2mny(b/\), there is an infinite number of
values of A that give a certain value for 8, as long as each
value of A is coupled with a corresponding value
b= (6/2mni)\. The probability of one particular value
of 6 is obtained by integrating over A:

The denominator in the right-hand side of Eq. (6) serves
to normalize f(6), so that

[ 7(8)do=1. (7)

In Appendix II four practical examples are worked
out, namely, combinations of monochromatic radiation
and radiation of constant intensity over a finite wave-
length range with uniform backings and backings of a
small wedge angle. f(8) is shown to be finite over a finite
range, and zero outside this range. The form of f(0)
given by Eq. (8) is used in the main body of this paper;
the effect of some deviations from this form is treated in
the appendix.

COMPUTATION OF REFLECTION AND
TRANSMISSION COEFFICIENTS

(A) Monochromatic Source, Uniform Backing

Systems with uniform, plane-parallel backings, ir-
radiated by a monochromatic source, offer no principal
problems, though the derivations of the coefficients are
complicated and tedious. The following cases are
treated:

(I) A semi-infinite nonabsorbing medium.

(IT) A nonabsorbing layer with plane-parallel sur-
faces.

(ITI) A thin, absorbing film without backing.

(IV) A thin, absorbing film on a semi-infinite, non-
absorbing backing.

(V) A thin, absorbing film on a nonabsorbing back-
ing with plane-parallel surfaces.

(VI) Two adjacent thin absorbing layers.

In any medium “un” between plane, parallel surfaces,
solutions of Maxwell’s equations for the electric (En)
and magnetic (H,) vectors may be expressed as (see
Stratton!)

En=(E.t exp[iK ns]
+E, exp[ —iK.z]) exp —iwt], (10)

Ho=Z, (ET exp[iK.2]
—E,. exp[—iKnz]) exp[ —iwt], (11)

where {= time, z= coordinate along direction of propaga-
tion. Here E,,* and E,.~ are arbitrary constants for the
solutions of Maxwell’s equations, and represent the
amplitudes of two waves traveling in opposite directions
in the medium. K,, has been defined variously as follows:

Kn=an+1iBn= 2m/\) (nn+tikn)

= (27/Nnm(14+ikn), (12)
K,= a,= (27/Nn., ;

where no=index of refraction of air, n,+1k, is com-
monly called the “complex index of refraction,” and #.,
is the index of refraction of the medium. k, and ku
have each been designated as the absorption coefficient
by different authors. Some authors make the distinction
that x, is the absorption index. In a nonabsorbing
medium, « and k are equal to zero.
The other quantities are defined as follows:

Zn =wu/ Kn, A\=wavelength in vacuum of the incident
light, w=angular frequency of the incident light, and
u=magnetic permeability of all media considered. We
define also

Zn ni 1= Zon) Lomi r= Kuni 1f Km. (13)

Then, if z=m represents a surface separating media
“m” and “m+ 1,” the boundary conditions required for
continuity of E and H may be written as follows (see
Stratton!) :

E. (at z=m)=E,.; (at z3=m)
and

H.,, (at z=m)= Hn (at z=m).

When K,—0, these expressions reduce to the one-

Two adjacent absorbing layers.
Absorbing layer between z= —a and z=0.
Absorbing layer between z=0 and z=. (See Fig. S.)

The expressions under V are not limited to trans-
parent backings alone, but are also valid for two
adjacent absorbing layers. The numerical computations
are, however, greatly complicated by including a finite
absorption coefficient for the backing.

Summarizing,

Case I gives R,; and To,

Case II gives R(6), R'(6), and T'(f) for a plain
backing; for the averaging process sub-
stitute these into Eq. (9),

Case IV gives Ry, and Toa, Roa and Ts,

backing; for the averaging process sub-
stitute these into Eq. (9).

small when e is large (at least several times =). This
difference is usually negligible in comparison to experi-

and CD*—C*D=2i(C:D,—C,D;) has the same sign as
the imaginary part of (—D/C).

Therefore, T is seen to be positive in either case, as it
should be. The application of Pierce’s tables caused an
indeterminacy in the sign that could not be settled very
easily; the complex variable approach was therefore
thought to present the results more rigorously.

In the numerical computations 4, B, C, and D are
calculated first, and may be checked by the following
relationship that is derived from their definitions:

BC—AD=—2ip=—2i(Zos— Zw).

A, B, C, and D are all functions of \, 1a, ka, 10s, a, and b,
while p depends on 7; only.

Table I shows the results of computations of R and 7
for various thicknesses and optical constants of the
absorbing layer as found by substitution into the
formulas just derived. Substituting Egs. (20), (21), and
(22) into (3) and (4) gives the reflection and transmis-
sion of a metal film on a thick backing by means of
intensity addition. It is not feasible to prove analytically
that the results obtained in Case VIII by the two meth-
ods are equal, but the numerical results shown in Table I
demonstrate that within the accuracy afforded by the
tables used the results are identical in all examples tried.

CONCLUSIONS AND COMPARISONS
WITH OTHER AUTHORS

Expressions for the reflection and transmission by
semi-infinite nonabsorbing backings, uncovered as well
as covered with a thin metal film, and for normally inci-
dent radiation have been presented. In Appendix I the
results obtained using these expressions are compared
with the results obtained using the expressions of
Hadley and Dennison® for the same systems. It is also

shown by the use of Hadley and Dennison’s equations
for oblique incidence, that the expressions. developed
here are very good approximations even for angles of
incidence up to 30° from the normal.

Although expressions for semi-infinite backings are
also presented elsewhere, the particular form of the
equations presented here is convenient for numerical
computations, and is also required for the treatment
of backings of finite thickness. For backings of finite
thickness results of the commonly used intensity addi-
tion method have been compared with the results of
amplitude addition. The latter method involves an
integration which is complicated, and cannot be per-
formed readily.

Goldschmidt! tried to circumvent this difficulty by
choosing an arbitrary value for 6, meaning a hypo-
thetical uniform backing thickness, that would give
agreement between the results of intensity addition of
internal reflections in the backing and the results for a
film with optically parallel surfaces in the special case of
an uncovered nonabsorbing film (Case VII and Case
11). He then substituted this value of 6 into the general
formulas for R and T for metal films on backings with
optically parallel surfaces. (Formulas derived in our
Case V.) The numerical results using his formulas
differed from those obtained by using intensity addition
of internal reflections in the backing. Mathematically,
his treatment defines 6; so that

R(a=0, 0)=R(a=0, 0)
and
T(a=0, 0)=T(a=0, 03)

when the thickness of the absorbing film is zero, and
then assumes that for any thickness of the absorbing
film

 

 

R(a, 0)=R(a, 0,) and T(a, 0)=7T\(a, Os).

However, the value of 6 for which R and 7 attain
their average values depends on a and therefore cannot
be given a constant value as was done by Goldschmidt.

Koller? objected to this treatment by Goldschmidt
and attempted to carry out the rigorous averaging
process by substituting for individual functions of 6,
their average values:

cosf=sinf=0 and cos’0=sin’0=73.

 

 

Mathematically, this amounts to the assumption,

I'(sinf), cosf= F (sind), (cosh),

substitution is not exact.

computed. Table II shows that even though the reflection and
transmission of the polarized components vary appreciably with
the angle of incidence, the total fractions of radiation reflected and
transmitted by the system are almost constant for angles of inci-
dence between 0° and 30°.

(Hadley and Dennison give one set of equations for the perpen-
dicular component, and indicate how these equations should be
modified to be applicable to the parallel component. This modifica-
tion results in a change of order of magnitude which may resultin a
loss of accuracy if an insufficient number of significant figures is
carried through in the computation.)

APPENDIX II. WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION
FOR THE PHASE ANGLE OF THE BACKING

Equation (6) gives a general expression for the weights to be
given to each value of the phase angle 6. In the main body of this
paper the expression given by Eq. (8) has been used for f(6). In
this appendix Eq. (6) is used to derive f(6) as follows:

If the source consists of a finite band of wavelengths, the in-
tensity of each wavelength within this band being the same,

o(A)=1/v when A—~/2<A< A 4/2
¢(\)=0 elsewhere.

If the backing is a wedge with plane surfaces and a small wedge
angle, the field of view rectangular, with sides parallel and perpen-
dicular to the edge of the wedge:

Y(b)=1/¢ when b—{/2<b<b+¢/2
Y(b)=0 elsewhere.

When 6 is large (for instance, when A~6000A, b~2X 105A) and ©
and v are small (for instance, y~100A; o~10!— 10°A), 1(0) is

closely approximated by a trapezoid as drawn in Fig. 6 of which
the dimensions are as follows:

Width measured at half height = J Semt/k when A <t/b.

: Dell =2mm¢/N when v/A>¢/b
Width of each slanted portion= of = 2amiyb/X when y/A<i/b.

In general, then, the width of the trapezoid measured at half-
height is proportional to the width of the wider of the two distri-
bution functions ¥ and ¢, the width of the slanted portions
proportional to the width of the narrower one.

When v/A=/b, the center section of the trapezoid disappears,
so that the graph of f(6) becomes a triangle.

When the source is monochromatic, 4=0; when the backing has
plane-parallel surfaces, {=0. In either case 8,—8, becomes zero,
and 63— 0, becomes zero, so that the trapezoid becomes a rectangle.
When both y=0 and ¢=0, f(6)=68(0—0b/\), where (x—2z) is
defined as follows:

REFLECTION AND TRANSMISSION BY METAL FILMS 614

6(x—2Z)=0 when xz,
é(x—Z)= when x=37, (39)

J sa—2)dr=1.

Substituting Eq. (38) into Eq. (9) gives the average values of R
and T for each case, which correspond to the measured quantities.
When both y=0 and ¢=0,

B= [ RO)50~b/Ndo=R(®/N); T=T(E/N).

This corresponds to Eqs. (25) and (26) for the case of mono-
chromatic radiation and uniform backings, with b=5, and A= A.
In the main part of the paper Eq. (8) has been used as an ap-
proximation to f(8). It is seen now that this corresponds to either
v=0 or ¢=0. It was already shown that when e= nr substitution
into Eq. (9) yields a result identical with that obtained by in-
tensity addition. It remains now to estimate the deviation from
this result when en, and when the sides are slanted. Since the
relative influence of the uncovered face of the backing is greatest
when the second face is also uncovered, the simpler examples of
plain backings without metal films are considered here.
Substituting the trapezoidal approximations to Eq. (38) into
Eq. (9) and taking for R and T the expressions given by Eqs. (16)
and (17) respectively, integration produces the following result:

R=Ri+A(e, 8); T=Ti—A(e, 0),

where R; and T' are the results of intensity addition, and A is an
oscillating function in e and 8, which has maximum values given in
Eqs. (40) and (41):

max = (4N— 3)/8N2% when o= 0, (40)
Amux™>(4N—3)/8N%5 when 6> 7/2, (41)
where

Wee (21)

When 6>0, the deviation is less than Am.’. Table III demon-
strates that amplitudeladdition is necessary for monochromatic
radiation incident on a uniform, flat backing, but when the inci-
dent radiation extends over a band width of 100A, intensity
addition is sufficiently accurate even for the uniform flat backing.
When the backing has a thickness range of 2X10 cm (1 percent),
and monochromatic radiation is used, intensity addition may or
may not be justified, depending on the a ccuracy desired. For a
finite band width and a nonuniform back ng, intensity addition
gives exceedingly good agreement with the rigorous amplitude
treatment. Even better agreement is obtained for thicker backings
and the same range in wavelengths and thicknesses.
