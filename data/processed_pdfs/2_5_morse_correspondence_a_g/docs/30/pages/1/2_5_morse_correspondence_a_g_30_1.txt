0 Professor Caldwell of our Electrical "mmm*fnopart-
ment tells me that your plant is getting an IBM number 704 machine
this fall and that there may be some free time on the machine at
first, which might be available for us to use for pure research 3
and/or education. Since there is some indication that IBM will 4
make a 704 available to us about fourteen months from now, we i
would certainly welcome a chance to get acquainted with a 704 ;
this year, so we could develop our sub-routines ahead of time.
I would be glad to see you here at Tech to talk this
over, if a visit here happens to be convenlent.  If it is, please
call my seeretary, UN4-69C0O, extension 857, to arrange a time.
If this is not convenient, Dr. Verzuh and Mr. Arden, of our staff, :
will be glad to come to Lynn sowetime to see what arrangements can |
be made. i
Thank you for your offer of cooperation.
Sinecerely,
