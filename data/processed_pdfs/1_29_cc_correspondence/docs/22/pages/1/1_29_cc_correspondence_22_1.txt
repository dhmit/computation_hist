COMPUTATION CENTER
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Cambridge 39, Massachusetts

INSTALLATION OF THE IBM 7090

As previously announced, the Computation Center
will replace its IBM 709 with an IBM 7090 this winter,
The T090 is program-compatible in almost all respects
with the 709, and the programming systems presently
available at the Center will continue to be used but
with a considerable advantage 1n speed.

Together with this change in our primary equipment,
the Center will also replace the present off-line tape-
processing equipment with two IBM 1401 systems. This
change will provide the improvement in efficliency
necessary in this area in light of the 7090's greater
speed.

Schedule Â« Delivery date for the 7090 1s December 15,
1961. To allow time for the necessary changes to the
computer room, the 709 will be removed around December 1,
1961, and the 7090 should begin operating early in
January.

Delivery date for the two 140l1's 1s January 26, 1962,
and they should be operating soon after. No shut-down
period i1s anticlpated for their installation.

Courses - The Center will try to arrange for computer
time for courses at other installations during December.
If you are in charge of a course using the computer,
please contact Mr. Steinberg, the Operations Manager,

Room 26-161, telephone extension 4116, as soon as
possible regarding expected needs during this period.

Computer Configuration - Exact configuration of
the 7090 and 1401's will be announced later. It is
expected that all 709 programs being used at the Center
will run without trouble. If you feel you have a
special problem, however, please feel free to contact
the Centert's consulting staff.
