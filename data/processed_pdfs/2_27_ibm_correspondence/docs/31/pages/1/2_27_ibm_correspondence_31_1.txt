M.I.T,

ODear Loren:

 

We have recently made a survey of the traffie of
our ecard punches that are used to Support the operation of
the 709 computer. As a result of this survey, of whieh a
report is enclosed, the operations staff of the Center has
concluded that the addition of three more 026 Card Punches
to our present complement of ten 026 Card Punches and one

Y024 Card Punch would be appropriate.

It 1s difficult to estimate the proper amount of
service that should be obtainable from the card punches that
we have, especially when one conslders the surges due to students
in classes. However, 1t appears significant to us, by almost
eÃ©very criteria one can apply, that the present service we are

able to offer with the card punches available is definitely
poor,

Sincerely,

F. J. Corbato
Associate Director
