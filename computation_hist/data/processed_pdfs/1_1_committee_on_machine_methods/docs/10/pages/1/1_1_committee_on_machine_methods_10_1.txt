Kopal reported that the situation was not yet clear about
Verzuh or Salzer. The Committee felt that Verzuh should take
M39 this term, but Verzuh has not yet gotten clear enough or his
various duties to be able to carry this and teach his course and
take M39 and do his thesis. Nevertheless the Committee felt it
was better for him to sign up for M39 now and to work toward a
lightening of his duties; if this turns out‘to be impossible, to
cancel M39 latero It appears only to wait'action by Stratton to
clear the matter up., In Salzer‘s case his supervisory committee
is meeting today and should clear up his questions.

Kopal indicated that Professor Gardner would appreciate
hearing from the Committee as to how he is to advise Electrical
Engineering men in this field what to take for their minors.
Morse will try to answer thiSe

Kopal also suggested that Professor Lighthill was giving a
talk here on Friday afternoon, that our seminar could attend
this talks

ri‘he rest of the meeting was devoted to working up a. draft
announcement to send out concerning the research assistsntships
