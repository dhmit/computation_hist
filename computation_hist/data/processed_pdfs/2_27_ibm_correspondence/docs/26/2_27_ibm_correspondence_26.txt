Dear Professor Morse:

On behalf of the IBM participants, I want to
thank you for the opportunity to participate in the round table
discussion last Friday.

It was very stimulating to us, and I feel that
this type of meeting is worthwhile, and should be repeated
after a suitable interval.

Sincerely yours,

(Grrr
