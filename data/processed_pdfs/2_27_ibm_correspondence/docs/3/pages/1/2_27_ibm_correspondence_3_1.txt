Dear Dr. Keenzy:

It is with a great deal of pleasure that I enclose our check
for $900. 00 representing the first semester portion of the stipends
for the IBM Research Associates and Aspsistants recently appointed
for the 1959-60 school year in connection with the M.I.T. Computation
Center. A detailed description of the appointments is attached.

The increasing use of the IBM 704 Computer at M.I.T. by
the New England colleges both as an educational device and a research
tool has been very encouraging to IBM, and we are delighted that
Brown is having an active part in it as represented by these research

appointments.
