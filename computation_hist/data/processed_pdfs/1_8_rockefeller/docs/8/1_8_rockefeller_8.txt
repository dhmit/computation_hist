Dear Mr. Cobb:

Way back in February you wrote me asking when
it would be possible for you to obtain photographs of
our new Computation Center. I have been delaying answerâ€”
ing you, hoping to give you a definite answer and perhaps
some photographs, but there have been delays in building
construction and the Center is not quite completed yet.

I hope that we can make these photographs some
time in June and that this will not be too late for your
purposes.

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse
Director
