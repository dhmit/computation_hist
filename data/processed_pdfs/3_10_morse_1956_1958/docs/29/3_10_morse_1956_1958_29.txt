Dear Dr. Estrin:

I am Sorry to have delayed answering your letter of
May 11, but I have been out of town for awhile. Our Project
plans for the Computation Center are not fixed as yet 80 we are
not exactly sure how many senior people we can take on. Never-
theless we would very much 1ike to talk over various possibilities
with you and would be glad to pay your travel expenses to come up
here for a day in the near future, Monday or Tuesday, July 2 or
3, would be a possibility. Friday, July 6, would be somewhat
more crowded but might be possible. If you can come any of these
days or have an alternative date, please let me know soon, because
1 would like to arrange to have you talk to geveral people whlle
you are here.

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse, Director
M.I.T. Computation Center
