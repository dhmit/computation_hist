MEMORANDUM
To: N. M, Sage
From: Prof. Philip M. Morse Date: 2/20/51
Subject: Proposal for Research and Training Project in Applied

Mathematics, using large-scale Computing Equipment,
particularly Whirlwind.

Whirlwind Project has now reached a stage of development
where its potentialities can be utilized, together with the other
computing equipment at Technology, in a coordinated research and
training program, of the sort anticipated by ONR during its
several years of support of the Project. Both the Institute and
the Navy are vitally interested in the use of large-scale com-
puting devices for the solution of scientific and engineering
problems, and for the promotion of training for students inter-

ested in this field.

Of course a part of the time of Whirlwind will be used
for the solution of a special Air Force problem, and it is ex-
pected that the Air Force will contribute an appreciable part of
the support of the Whirlwind Project, for the development of
equipment and methods for the solution of this problem. Neverthe-
less, approximately half the working time of the machine itself
will be available for the fundamental program, mentioned above and

outlined below.
