Introduction

Periodically corrections for Fortran II are issued by the IBM
Applied Programming Gra:p in New York City. As soon as these corrections
are received by the Center, they are incorporated into our FORTRAN Library |
Tape. Occasionally, however, modifications are released which are of
considerable interest to the Fortran users. For example, on December 21
we received & memorandum which contains a number of interesting modifications
to Fortran, The following sections of this memorandum contsin & verbatim
statement of these changes as released by the IBM Applied Programming Unit.

FORTRAN MODIFICATIONS/ADDITIONAL FORMAT FEATURES

Format facilities have been expanded, in the new Imput-Output
Hollerith Routine (IOH), as follows:

1. The control character X; written nX, where 0£ n £120.

a) I0H, on input, will interpret this to mean that the fol-
lowing n characters of input should be skipped.

@oo? READ 1, K, A
1 FORMAT (12X, 12, 8X, F8.3)

This will cause cols. 1-12 to be skipped, cols. 13-14 (K) to be read,
colz., 15-22 to be skipped, and cols. 23-30 (A) to be read.

b) IOH, on output, will interpret this to mean that the fol-
lowing n characters of output should be blanks.

@0 PRINT 1, K, A
(1 as in the above example)

T™his will print E, preceded by 12 blanks, and A, preceded by 8 blanks.
