4 x 10 » and 4 seconds are available. The machine contains the

following Specilal units: a triggered electronice Switeh to

quency distribution of a set of data. 1In additlion, there is
provision for a large numbep of non-lineap Operatioﬁs. For
the elementary linear Operations, accuracy of the computer has
been held to within 0.1%. For many of the problems of prime
Interest, the over-all accuracy is within 1%,

For the feeding of information to the computer, there is
available (1) a fiim Scanner which will read into the computer
functions recorded on 33 mm. T1im, eoge =5 photograph of an
©8cilloscope trace. (2) A curve tracer, an electronic sepvo-
mechanism which follows a mask cut to conform to the shape of a
desired function. (3) A digitai interpreterp which converts
digital information from s punched paper Cape into a signal suit-
able for input to the computer,

Output systems include (1) a cathode ray tube for visual op
photographic observation of solutions. (2) A peak-reading
voltmeter which will give a Steady reading at any given point.
(3) A two-coordinate plotter will permit graphical representation
of the functional relationship between any two of the variables
of the system with an accuraecy within 0.1%. (4) A digital
interpreter will permit results to be typed by an electro-
matic typewriter or punched on a paper tape.

The machine has been applied to the following problems:
