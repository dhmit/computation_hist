(1) Sample Preparation

All samples were prepared in the shape of 1- by 1- by 1-in.
cubes. The alumina samples were prepared from Norton
Company 38X, 220 F alumina by grinding in steel mills, acid
treating to remove iron impurities introduced in milling, and
casting in plaster molds from an acid suspension as described
by Hauth.®* Cylindrical pores were selected to study the
effect of pore anisotropy according to the relations of Loeb
(Part VIII). Two series of samples were prepared with pore
diameters of 0.082 cm. and 0.146 cm. by casting around drill
rods firmly set in the mold. To insure that the suspension
penetrated into the small spaces between the rods, the mold
was placed on a vibrating table during casting. After the
initial set, the drill rods were removed, leaving uniform
parallel cylindrical pores through the piece. To prevent tear-
ing from bending or sidewise movement of the rods, cracking
from drying shrinkage about the rods, or slumping on re-
moval of the rods, the techniques of moldmaking and casting
had to be closely controlled. Photographs of a mold em-
ployed and one of the samples are shown in Figs. 1 and 2.
The samples prepared are listed in Table IT.

Samples were also prepared having isometric pores of
nearly uniform size. These were made in this laboratory
by R. L. Coble by incorporating up to 50 vol. 7 naphthalene
flakes in the casting slip. Just before use the naphthalene was
pressed through a 60-mesh screen. After casting, the samples
were dried for an extended period at 60° to 70°C. until no
naphthalene odor could be noticed. The samples were then
fired in the customary manner for 3 hours at 1830°C. After
firing, polished sections were examined which indicated that
the pores were roughly spherical or ellipsoidal in shape. The
area of pore cross sections was determined with a precision
planimeter; from these data, the mean spherical diameter was
calculated by the procedure described by Fullman.? The
samples prepared had properties as shown in Table TII.

In addition to these samples of alumina, samples were pre-
pared from nickel and graphite with cylindrical pores 0.146
cm. in diameter. These were prepared by drilling the
requisite number of pores in each sample. The nickel em-
ploved was Nivac, an extremely high-purity and homogeneous
vacuum-cast material supplied by the Vacuum Metal Corp-
oration, Cambridge, Massachusetts. The graphite employed
was graphite CS, density 1.55 gm. per cm.?, supplied by the
National Carbon Company. The samples prepared had
porosities as shown in Table IV.

(2) Experimental Measurements

All measurements of thermal conductivity were carried out
in the apparatus previously developed in this laboratory
(Part IV) which employs a 1-in. specimen cube and two 1-in.
cube standards. Thermocouples are located in holes in each
sample, so that interfacial thermal resistance is eliminated,
and multiple guard heaters prevent lateral flow.

For the anisotropic cylindrical pores, two measurements
are necessary to define the effects of porosity. If the pores
are set so that their axes are parallel to heat flow, the cross-
sectional pore fraction, the ratio of pore area to total area, is
uniform and equal to the pore volume fraction. If the pores
are set with their axes perpendicular to the heat flow, the
cross-sectional pore fraction will vary with the position in
the sample. For the samples tested here the maximuin
cross-sectional pore fraction will be largest with the pores per-
pendicular to heat flow. For the random isotropic pores, the
cr.oss-secti(mul pore fraction is independent of position or
direction and is equal to the volume pore fraction.

In addition to the geometry and number of pores and the
thermal conductivity of the solid, it is necessary to know the
total emissivity of the material for the calculation of
the effects of porosity (see Table I). These data were
available for Al.O; samples prepared in this laboratory and
were determined by Vianey?® using Brownlow’s method
which has been described by N’nrton‘.”"’ The value ranges
from ().;’.H .to.(HH. which is similar to most refractory oxides.
The emissivity of nickel is low, ranging from 0.07 to 0.12.1°

The emissivity of graphite at elevated temperatures has been
reported by Powell and Schofield,!! but no low-temperature
data were available. Measurements were carried out by
B.rqwnlow's method” on the graphite used here at 500°C.,
gving a value of 0.82 in good agreement with an extrapolation
ofhigher-temperature data. The emissivities of the materials
investigated are shown in Fig. 3.
