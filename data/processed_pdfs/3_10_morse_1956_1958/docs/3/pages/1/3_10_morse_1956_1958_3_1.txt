Assistantships in Machlne Computation

This memo is to remind you that the "Machine Committee"
Assistantships which have been available to graduate students at
M.I.T. during the past four years, from the ONR-Whirlwind Project,
will terminate at the end of this academic year. There will be
available a smaller number of I.B.M. Assistantships, paying approxi-
mately the same amounts, however. The enclosed sheet gives a
description of the duties involved.

Note that applications must be in my hands by March 15.
They should include a.) a letter from the applicant, giving his
experience in mathematics and computing practice and giving his
reasons for being interested in the work of the Computation Center
b.) a letter (sent directly to me) from the applicantÂ®s department,
recommending the applicant's appointment to the assistantship,
indicating how the applicant can aid the department better to
utilize digital computing aids in 1its research, and indicatling the
stipend pald to assistants in the department. |

Awards will be wade, as before, by the Institute Committee
on Machine Computation (names appear below). Please see me or
other members of the Committee if you have further questions con-
cerning applications or dutiles.
