Dear Professor Morse:

In accordance with our telephone conversation late
Tuesday night, November 13, I am enclosing an ozalid copy of the
floor plans of the Computation Center which we discussed. I
submitted this plan to the architecture (Skidmore, Owings & Merrill)
during our conference on Wednesday, November 14.

I will discuss the many problems that arose at this
conference with you at your convenience on Tuesday next week.

S incerely yours ,

AML
