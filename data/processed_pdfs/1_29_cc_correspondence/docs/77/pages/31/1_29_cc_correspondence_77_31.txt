a subprograin called TABLEl has been assembled and is
present in the job as a binary deck. The following

instructions might be used to set up a convert operation:

LOCATION OP VARIABLE FIELD
LXA STABLEL, 4
SXA *+1,4
CAQ 0,0,6

Since the transfer-vector cell which had contained the

BCD equivalent of "TABLEl" at assembly time, had been
replaced by the loading program by a transfer operation
with the address of the table, this sequence of instructions
has the effect of getting the address of the table from the
transfer vector, and storing this address in the address

portion of the CAQ operation.
