Dear Phil:

Dr, Gordon Walker, Executive Director of the
American Mathematical Society, has an interesting suggestion
regarding our proposed meeting; there was an announcement
of the steering committee in the last issue of the Notices
of the Society.

He suggested that the meeting be scheduled as
a Symposium to be held in conjunction with, and probably
following, one of the regular meetings of the Society.
Such symposia are held from time to time and he feels our
meeting would be eminently suitable to be co-sponsored by
the Society.

This would have several advantages. It would
give the Computing Center a degree of professional recog-
nition by mathematicians which may be appreciated; it would
enable the delegates to take in a meeting o the Society if
they so desired; and the Society would, if we wish, take
the responsibility for arrangements, for the publication of
the report, and for various other time-consuming chores.

Dr. Walker and I could come and see you about
this anytime you wish if you feel the suggestion is worth
pursuing. It all depends, of course, on being able to find
a suitably placed and timed Society meeting.

Dr. Prager told me he enjoyed your talk in
Madison.

Best regards,
Sincerely yours,
Walter Freiberger
