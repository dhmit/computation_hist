prof. Rubinoff up till nowsI consider his attitude towards our
country being most kind. Furthermore, in Munich I also got
acquanted with Mr, Gorn, the well-known specialist on language
theory at the Upiversity of Perma. I have been looking forward
to meeting him in Warsaw in July as a member of the group of
American experts on standards in the field of automatic
programming. Myself beeing appocinted their host as director

of the Institute of Mathematicsl Machines of the Polish Academy
of Sciences. Unfortunately, a smaller group arrived than the
expected one and Mr, Gorn had not been among them.

Among other well-known peocple belonging o the Computer—
World and living in Philadelphia, I know Mr. issac Auerbach,
the representative of the US.and President of the Ipnternational
Federation for Information Processing, whom I often have the
pleasure of seing /almost every 10 months/ during the IFIP
conferences, myself being representative of Ppland to IFIP.

In case you find that the another university would be
the proper place for my stay, please feel free to arrange
kindly matters up to your opinion,

My ambition would be &o complete my possible scientific
training with proper publications, as well as to extend care
in order to make my stay profitable to the inviting institution.

I would be most happy to visit some other institutions
besides the inviting University. This especially concerns an
university of California as it would permit me to pay a visit
to you.

Enclosed, please find my brief scientific biography
/translated into English/ in case this would occasionally be
needed.

Thavking you most heartly once more for your kindness
and the way in which you take interest in the matter of my

possible arrival to the U.S.A., I remain with best wishes and
regards

Yours very sincerely
