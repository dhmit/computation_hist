We are proposing that the Chairmen of each section be
allowed to bring with him to the meeting a rapporteur with some
technical background who can take notes of the proceedings to
serve the writers of the conference report as raw material. This
rapporteur may be a graduate student, and would be paid his
expenses,

Please let me know if you have any further suggestions
on the organization of the meeting,
