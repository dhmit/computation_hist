1. Introduction. Some interesting hyperbolic differe
represented in the form

(1) Erin/0.x 6g + H(r + y)u = 0.

An instance of (l) as the wave equation in space was first considered bv Euler
[5; 430—81]. Instances of this equation in the ﬁeld of differential geometry
(Laplace) are given in Darboux [3; 52], and instances in the ﬁeld of compressible
hydrodynamics were considered by Riemann [6; 173] for linear ﬂows and by A.
Steichen (see Ackaret [l; 317]) for plane ﬂows.

We shall concern ourselves entirely with the evaluation of the Riemann
function of (1), by means of which Riemann showed how to solve (1) for given
boundary conditions. The Riemann function, despite its crucial importance,

ntial equations can be

  
      
  
   
   
 
 
    
   
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
   
 
  
 
  
 

seems to have been found in closed form only in the special cases H(r) = ——A
and H(r) = —>\(>\ + l)r’r2, A constant. Moreover these cases are just those

solved by Riemann, who, in turn, ha. even been anticipated to some extent by

Euler [4]! Undoubtedly, the Picard iteration process and its existence proof

{or the Riemann function in general, drew attention away from the evaluation

of this function. Nevertheless, the fact that the Riemann function has been ‘
evaluated only for these two simple cases restricts the number of physical

situations to which equation (I) can correspond and still remain simple enough

to permit solution in closed form by use of a Riemann function.

It will therefore be our purpose to consider the possibility of finding the
Riemann function for a greater variety of functions H(r)i The methods will
be twofold First of all we shall use a specialized artiﬁce to obtain the
Riemann function in closed form for a few types of H(r), namely [{(7‘) =
—)\(>\ + 1),,i2l/sinh3 p(r + v) (A, p, v constant), and some of its limiting cases,
11(7) = ~>x exp pr, ——)\(>\ + 1), r2, and —>\. Then we shall consider a certain
Fourier integral expression for the Riemann function of (1) with arbitrary H(r).
This latter expr on is due to Riemann, who derived it in a heuristic manner.
We shall also indicate :1 rigorous proof of Riemann's expression, since this long-
neglected expression is of potential importance with the further development of
analysis.
