December 3, 1953

Persons Present: a. Feshbach, c. c. Lin, P. H. Horse,
. . . . w. H. Seifert, F. I. Verzuh .

Horse reviewed the discussions between the Bureau of
Standards 'i'ables computing Grou , the Applied Mathematics Ad-
visory Committee to the Bureau of which Horse is now chairman),
and the National Science Foundation regarding 7a conference on the
needs for numerical tables and facilities for making these tables.
He reported that it had been suggested that HIT sponsor such a - _
conference next spring and the possibility that the Science .Foun-
dation could finance such a conference. It was suggested that to
explore these possibilities a subcommittee of Feshbach, Hildebrand,
andtliiorse be set up to report back to the main comittee at same future
nee .nc.

Verzuh then reviewed the present operation or the differ-
ential analyzer and its .possible budget for later operation. At
present, the differential analyzer is financed and is completely
used by the Instrumentation Lab. The present budget is about
330,000 a year for personnel (2 engineers , ’ chnician 1 com-
puter) with 40 per cent overhead, about 01W a year or tea. >4 M
t ials and this '1 h a small maintenance cost brings the total
budge o a a year. Verzuh reported that on an
austerity basis the dget could be cut mainly in the personnel
post to about $20,000 a year.

. Seifert outlined in a similar manner the budget for the
DACL analogue computer. The present budget is over- a half million
a year, but ifvthe machine were cut down to one row of Dc equip- V
ment and one row or Ac equipment (allowing nearly 100 operations,
such as integration or multiplication), the budget then, including
2 or 3 technicians and a supervisor and engineer, would be about ‘
$35,000 a years

Verzuh then reviewed the IE! equipment. At present,
the budget is about $85,000 a year, which includes salaries for
about 8 people, material of about 53,000, and 13! rental, for the
rest or which $17,000 a year is needed for equipment used by the
Institute in its administration. On an austerity basis Verzuh
recdunended that several of the machines be relinquished (such
as the 60h) and that the staff could be reduced to 3 or I}. The
budget then would come to $17,000 for the equipment needed for
KIT administration, $21,000 for search-computing equipment, and
about $12,000 for salaries, making a total minimum budget or about
350,000 a year. This could, or course, be reduced materially 11..
Ian would reduce its rental charges on part or all or the equipment.

Then followed a general discussion concerning what
equipment should be kept and how the committee should recommend
