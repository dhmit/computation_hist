Subject: Summary Report of FREE Time Usage of the Whirlwind Computer during
the 12-lionth Period January 1 - December 31, 18066.

In accoxdance with our discussions concerning the expected usage
of the 704 Calculator, I have prepared 2 12-month summary of FREE time usage
of the Whirlwind Computer during the period January 1 ~ December 31, 1956.

It is of interest to note that ONB's "free time" usage of Whirlwind
breaks down as follows:

Minutes Dollar
Used Valuation
Machine Computation Committee 1,309.6 $.60,639.
Solid State and Molecular
Theory (Slater) 25,181 .4 103,417.
Miscellandous Projects 24,928.5 78,924 $212,979.

The total machine usage during this 12-month period for thiz type of work
was 51.319.5 minutes or approximately 855. _ 835.3 hours. I believe the
detailed breakdown contained on the attached hed summarizing table == problen
vumber, title, programmer, supervisor, DSR contract, government contrect,
minutes used, and dollar value, provide useful statistics. The dollar value
igs based on an assumed rate of $250/hour --~ obviously we have not collected
this money since it is "free tine" usage.
