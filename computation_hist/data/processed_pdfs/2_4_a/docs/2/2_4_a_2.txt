Dear Professor Panov:

-.. We received your four reports today and are quite pleased
and interested in them. We have several graduate students who

will be able to make the necessary translation. In exchange I

am enclosing the latest copy of our progress report which deseribes
our first efforts in the new Computation Center. I have put the
name of your Institute on our mailing list and will send you
further reports as they come out. Similarly, 1f I see other
material such as reports which may be of interest to you, I will
get them to you.

I hope that you and any of your staff will visit our
Center whenever you come to this country.

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse
Director
