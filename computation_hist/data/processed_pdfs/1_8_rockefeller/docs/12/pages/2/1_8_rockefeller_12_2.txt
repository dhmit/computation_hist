- systems, not as abstract models, but in such a fashion that
contéemporary economic problems can be considered.

The goal of our Center is not to conpote as s dﬁal scientists
with activities such as those listed but rather té contribute from

the computational expert side towards the inclusion of modern computing T

machines in social science research.

Professor Orcutt has saild that he will be glad to amplify any of
the above topies which I have attempted to summarize, (any distortions
are mine). Due to the press of time before your December 3 meeting,
his phone numbers are: (office) KIrkland 7-7600, extension 2550; (home)
IVanhoe 4-2896.

If I can be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to
contact me.
