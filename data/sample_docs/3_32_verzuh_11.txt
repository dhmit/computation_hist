I have considered the qualifications
of this
proposal in light of existing
academic rules regarding
the establishment
of a DIC contract,
and I feel that
the project will contribute
to our educational
and research
program.
As a matter of fact, it is not unreasonable
to
expect that several theses may originate
as a result of
this work . (I am current l y superv i sing a programming
thesis which is very definitely
of this character.)
As
you know, I have been asked to take over Mr. Porter's
assignment in the Digital Computer Laboratory,
and in
this assignment I will be available
to supervise this
effort.
Finally,
the existing
space and f acilities
in
the Barta Bu ilding are available
and adequate for the
conduct of this research.
I hope the above comments have covered all
pertinent
items required for this contract negotiation.
However, if I can be of any f urther a ss istance , please
do not hesitate
to call me.
Sincerely
yours,
F. M. Verzuh
