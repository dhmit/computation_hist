Dear Professor Morse:

Many thanks for your letter of July 12, I will
be here the week of August 6 but away from August 13 until
after Labor Day.

T hope that you will not make a special trip to
New York on my account, If, however, you should be coming
here for some other purpose = either during the week of
August 6 or later in September -- I would be very pleased
to see you. My secretary, Miss Harris, will be glad to
fix an appointment if you will get in touch with her when
your plans are settled.

Sincerely yours,

rr
