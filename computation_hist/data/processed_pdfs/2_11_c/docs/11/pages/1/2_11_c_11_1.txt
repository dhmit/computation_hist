We have a wide range or problems from these or language

We ‘do not code the usual problem which comes to us, so these
persons would be engaged mainly in the special and interesting
problems and in writing out programs rather than detailed codins.

I would appreciate it it you could let me know of any
person who might be interested in taking such a position either
this spring or next tumor, or in suggesting that such people
should write me directly. The salary we would offer would be
normal to universities, not as high as industrial positions, but
the men would have the opportunity of further class work and would
have contact with a wider variety of problems than in industry.
