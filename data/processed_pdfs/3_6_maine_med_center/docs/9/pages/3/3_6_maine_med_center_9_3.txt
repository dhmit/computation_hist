Excerpt from Silvanus P. Thompson: The L_nfe
of William Thomson, Baron Kelvin of L:u;gf.
London, MacMillan, 1910, vol. 1, p. 15]—1:)():
The doctrine of electric images, several times
mentioned, seems to have been in T homson’s {11111(1
before he left Cambridge; but it developed itself
with surprising rapidity during his sojo.urn in Paris,
and shortly after his return to Cambridge he com-
municated it to Liouville in three letters, the sub-
stance of which was printed in the Journul’(l'e
mathematiques in October 1845 and June 1846.
This method, which even now is not .:u‘lquu.te?ly
appreciated, is so elegant, and so frmtfpl in its
applications, that it merits some attention from
the scientific reader. It furnishes a most cogent
illustration of the value of that which has been
aptly termed the cross-fertilization of the S(rie.nces,
the value of introducing into one branch of science
the concepts that have arisen in another. To explain
the concept of electric images, it may be \\'e]l. to
begin with a concrete and familiar case of optical
images. Every one knows that if a candle 1s placed
in front of an ordinary plane mirror, the image of
it, seen by looking into the mirror, is, as it were,
another candle of equal size and brightness with the
first, situated apparently exactly as far behind the
mirror as the real candle is in front. In fact, if the
mirror were to be removed from its frame, and a
second candle set in the position where the image
previously appeared, the amount of illumination
received at any given point in front of the mirror
from the two candles would be identical with the
amount received from the one candle and its image.
The limitations of the frame would prevent the
image, or the substituted candle, from being seen
from every direction. If the mirror be conceived to
be indefinitely extended, and its frame to be in-
finitely wide and high, these limitations would be
removed. If, instead of a plane mirror, a spherical
mirror or silver ball were substituted, the image of
a candle placed in front will appear to be a smaller
andle situated now within the spherical surface,
and at a distance behind the silvered face not equal
to the distance of the candle in front, but nearer to
the face. The apparent size and distance of this
image can be calculated by easy geometrical rules:
and again it will be true that if the mirror be re-
moved, and there be substituted an equivalent
smaller candle in the place where the Image ap-
peared, the illumination at any point in front will
remain unaltered by such substitution.
Now, consider a small insulated conducting
body, such as a small metal sphere, charged with

positive electricity. If .plzu'efl' in the middle of a
Jarge empty room lt.\\'lll ]).l’().](;‘(‘tv fts 111ﬁuonce ll.lt.o
the space around it in radial Stl‘:llg!lt lines, acting
as though the electric charge upon 1t were concen-
trated at its centre. Now suppose a very large sheet
of copper, or some other g()o(l. (~nn<l.uvtm' of elec-
tricity, to be placed at the mfle of the charged
sphere at a short distance from 1t. 'It an be shown
that, for all points of the space in front of this
sheet, the sheet acts as an electric mirror; the
offects in this region being the same as if, in the
absence of the sheet, there had been a second
charged sphere placed exactly as far behind the
sheet as the actual sphere is in front of it. But there
is this curious peculiarity, that in order to procure
an equivalent effect this ‘image spher_'e’ would have
to be charged with an equal quantity of negative
electricity. The ‘image’ of a positive charge is a
negut‘i\'eyone, and vice versa. If we suppose the
sheet removed and the ‘image’ replaced by a small
actual sphere, negatively electrified to an equal
degree, the space between and around the spheres
will be traversed by a system of curved lines of
electric force emanating from one and terminating
at the other. If we remove the second sphere and
replace the sheet, the lines of force in front, emanat-
ing from the positive sphere, will still curve round
exactly as before until they reach the sheet. The
sheet will, in fact, receive (by induction) a negative
charge: and this charge will be distributed over its
surface according to a certain law, the density of
the charge being strongest at the point of the
surface nearest to the sphere, and weaker over the
surface outwards from this center. This case illus-
trates not merely the conception of electric images,
but also the much more refined conception which
Thomson had arrived at in 1842 (and Green before
him) of the replacing of an electrified body or point
by an electric charge distributed over a surface in
such a way as to be in equilibrium. If, to take
another case, the positive electric point charge 1s
placed in front of a large uninsulated metal sphere,
to act as a spherical mirror, there will again be an
electric ‘image’ formed within the sphere, and this
‘image’ will be negative; but its distance behind
the reflective surface will not be equal to the dis-
tance of the electric ‘object’ in front; and though
simple rules can be given for finding the position
and magnitude of the electric ‘image’, these rules
differ from those for the finding of the conjugate
images in optics. An electrical image is, then, an
electrified point, or system of points, on one side
of a surface, which would produce on the other
side of that surface the same electiical action which
the actual electrification of that surface really does
produce. The method of images can be extended to
many applications. For instance, if an electrified
point is situated between two parallel conducting
sheets, not only will it generate a primary ‘image’
