Dear Frank:

On the memorandum to you dated December 5 re problem number
M 139, we indicated that time for production runs would subsequently
be requested. We are now ready to make these runs.

Estimated time for the runs will be 4 1/2 hours.

Incidentally, Dick Moroney tells me that our double-precision
work justified itself on one of the cases. Since this program can
be made a SHARE routine, and covers a small but useful new class of
waiting=-line problems, the general utility afforded by the double
precision is valuable.
