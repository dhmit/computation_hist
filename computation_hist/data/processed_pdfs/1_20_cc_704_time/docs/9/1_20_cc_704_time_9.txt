Attention: Manager
Dear Sir:

On several occasions I have read with interest articles
on the installation of a 704 computer at the Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology. This installation was mentioned also in con-
nection with an article concerning the installation of a 705 com-
puter at the University of California, Los Angeles which will be
used exclusively for business problems and applications.

I am interested in learning more about the M.I.T. in-
stallation and the person in charge. We have in the past been
particularly concerned in applying digital computers to our
engineering problems and would like to extend further our knowledge
of this field. We would also like to know if M.I.T. is in position
to undertake studies of the application of digital computers to
power system engineering problems on a cooperative basis.

Any information you can send me will be gratefully

appreciated,
Your is
