Propoged Research Projects

In addition to the computations which will be performed as part ot
the normal MIT family computing load, there are several special contracts
which have been set up for the torthconing period, Table VI describes the
particular projects imvolved, projected annusal expenditures, and duration of
contract, respectively. The National Science Foundation and the Rockefeller
Foundation grantg will help to defray some of the operating costs of the Center, -

National Science Foundation Gramt

The National Science Foundation granted MIT $30,000 to "establish
the nucleus of a computing center, to extend existimg centers, and to pay
rental for camputing time., In some 1nltanc0l part of the fund may be used
for salaries of research assistantsâ€™ .

The foundation's progran is designed to stremghten basic research
in a number of fields by providing a research investigator's access to computing
facilities, 8Since many general-purpose university computing centers do not
have sufficient support for basic research, the National Science Foundation
appropriation is intended to stremgthen such activities. It is intended that
advances in scientific research will be accelerated by the formulation of am
adequate conceptual model for natural processes, and checking the accuracy of
the model by calculating anticipated behavior under particular circumstances
within the process,

Rockefeller Foundation Granmt

The Rockefeller Foundation has made a2 grant of $36,000 per year for
a three-year period to help support the research staff at the MIT Computation
Center, It is intended that the research group will explore new ways for using
high-speed computing equipment in the social seciences., These investigations
will include the followi ng studies: :

1. A study of machine logic and an attempt to use it to simulate
some of the human "thinking" processes. Por example, programs
will be written which will cause the machine to play tic tac toe,
checkers, chess, etc., which require varying degrees of logic
and complicated thought patterns,

2, Studies will be made in the areas of language tramslation and
historical research -- developing methods for coding information
in campaet form with spscific emohasis on rapid access,

3. A number of social science experimonta will be progrannod
on the 704 Caleulator simulating "gaming techniques' which
arise in complex economic systems, This will be similar to
some of the military "games" which were played during the
war using less-powerful machinery.
