1. Introduction. A steady compressible non-viscous flow is conical if it contains a
vertex P, such that on every half line through P the velocity components, pressure,
density, and entropy are constant. Various linearized conical flows have been discussed
by numerous authors. However, only three examples of non-linearized conical potential
flow fields are known to exist mathematically: Prandtl-Meyer flow around an edge [4]
with or without sweep; Taylor-Maccoll flow about a non-yawing circular cone [5]; and
an axisymmetric flow through a convergent nozzle discussed by Busemann [1]. In this
paper the construction of two new examples will be considered. Both contain two regions
of swept Prandtl-Meyer flow. In the first, the boundary has been chosen to prevent
them from interacting, and the hodograph is one-dimensional. From it can be obtained
a flow, with attached plane shock, over an object resembling an airplane with a swept-
forward wing of positive dihedral and with a thick fin. In the second, the boundary has
been chosen to permit interaction and the hodograph is two-dimensional. It was studied
originally in the hodograph space by one of the authors [2]. In the present treatment, the
need to consider possible difficulties in constructing the flow field from a knowledge of
the hodograph has been avoided by confining the discussion to the physical space. It
should also be remarked that in both examples the second order partial differential
equation for conical potential flow is of mixed type.

A pair of these examples could conceivably be used to study a particular, atypical
case of wing-body interference. Numerical results can easily be calculated, if necessary,
with the aid of a characteristics table and by means of standard techniques for numerical
integration of ordinary differential equations and numerical solution of characteristic
initial value problems for second order hyperbolic partial differential equations in two
independent variables.

2. Fundamental Ideas. The velocity potential function of a steady irrotational
non-viscous isentropic flow satisfies

(@*6;; — wu;)d%/0x; dx; = 0 (2.1)
where z; (7 = 1, 2, 3) are rectangular coordinates,
u; = d¢/dx; (2.2)
is the velocity component parallel to the z;-axis in units of the maximum speed of flow,
= 1/2(y — DA — uu) = 1/2(+ — 1) — ¢) (2.3)

is the square of the velocity of sound, Kronecker’s delta 6;, = 1(0) if 7 = (3%) 7, and the
convention has been adopted that repeated indices imply summation over their range.
If ¢* = wu; > a’, the flow is supersonic, and there exist real characteristic surfaces,
which are envelopes of the Mach cones

[u.(z% — z)]° = (¢° — a’)(z% — z)(a*% — z,) (2.4)

where z* are running coordinates. At these surfaces the partial derivatives of ¢ of the
second or higher order may have discontinuities while ¢ and d¢/9z; remain continuous,
as may occur when two solutions are patched together.

The image of a flow under the mapping z; — u; is defined to be its hodograph. Ip
general, three-dimensional flows have three-dimensional hodographs, but not the ex.
amples in the following sections. Flows with one (two)-dimensional hodographs haye
been called simple (double) waves. The relevant properties of simple waves, discussed
in [3], will be summarized briefly. For some function (2), u; = u(x). Now (2.1) implies

aul = wal)’ = (qq) (2.5)

where u] = du,/du. The hodograph is any curve obtainable from a Prandtl-Meyer epi-
cycloid by deforming its plane into a cone with vertex at u; = 0. To specify the curve
completely an additional equation and initial conditions are required. For example, ip
a swept Prandtl-Meyer flow the velocity component parallel to a fixed unit vector ),
must be constant, that is,

u;\; = constant. (2.6)

In the physical space the prototype of the hodograph point u(x), a surface up = constant
which also bears constant pressure, density, and entropy, is a plane normal to u/ . The
exact locations of the prototype planes in the physical space are as yet undetermined.
If all are forced to pass through a common point, the simple wave will be a conical flow.
Finally, note that a prototype plane is a characteristic surface, all of whose Mach cones
are congruent and have parallel axes.

Now let

Xo = 2./2(a = 1, 2),
Later it will also be convenient touse X = X, ,Y = X, , u = vu; , and v = u, . Note

that to a point (curve) in the X, X,-plane there corresponds in the z;-space a line through
(cone with vertex at) the origin. Consider a general conical flow with vertex at the

z= x3, W = Us (2.7)

origin. Since u; = d¢/dz; are homogeneous of degree zero in the z, s, ¢ may be assumed
with no loss of generality to be homogeneous of degree one. Then for some ®
0 = 29(X, , X,) (2.8)
Ue = dp/0x, = IB/3X, , w= dp/dz = & — X u, (2.9

and (2.1) becomes

[@%(8as + Xo Xp) — (uy — wX a) (us — wXp)] 8°®/0X, 9X, = 0. (2.11)

Characteristics for (2.11) are curves X, = Xo(?) in the X, X,-plane on which the partial
derivatives of ® of second or higher order may have discontinuities, while ® and §®/dX.
remain continuous. To these curves there correspond cones T./2 = X(t) on which, by
(2.10) or its analogs the partial derivatives of ¢ of second or higher order will have
corresponding discontinuities, while by (2.8) and (2.9) ¢ and 90/1. remain continuous.

Thus z./z = X(t) are conical characteristic surfaces for (2.1). A plane tangent to one
of them along the ray z./2 = X_, must be tangent to the Mach cone (2.4) based on
u; = u;(X, , X,) with vertex at the origin and must correspond to the tangent to the
characteristic X, = X,(#). Hence the characteristic directions for (2.11) must be those
of the lines through (X, , X,) tangent to the conic

UX + w)? = (¢* — D)(X*XX* + 1) (2.12)

with running coordinates X*. The type of (2.11) is hyperbolic, parabolic, or elliptic
accordingly as (X, , X,) is outside, on, or inside (2.12). For a conical simple wave (2.11)
is of hyperbolic type (except possibly on a curve on which the type is parabolic), with
straight characteristics. Furthermore, a region of hyperbolic type adjacent to a region
of uniform flow must be a conical simple wave.

3. Flow along a conical wall. It is well known that swept Prandtl-Meyer flow over a
dihedral angle can be generalized into simple wave flow past a curved cylindrical wall.
Now a generalization to simple wave flow in a trough with boundaries composed of plane
and conical segments will be discussed.

Consider uniform supersonic flow along a plane wall on which is a line inclined with
respect to the direction of flow by more than the Mach angle. Let P be any point on I.
Extend the boundary beyond [ as a cone through ! with vertex P, and eventually join
the cone to another plane segment. Attempt to fit a conical simple wave to this boundary.
Let the origin of coordinates be at P. Describe the boundary by

x; = 1v;(p) (3.1)
where 7 and p are independent. With no loss of generality assume
vu; = 1, viv: = 1. (3.2)
Then
put = ipl! = 0, vo! = —1. (3.3)

Assume that the prototype planes pass through the rulings of (3.1). Then

wv; — 0 (3 4)
and the boundary condition on the cone becomes u; = Av; + Bv! for some scalar func-
tions A (x) and B(u). By (3.3) and (3.4) B = A’, so

wi(p) = A(wvi(p) + A" (wily). (3.5)

Now (2.5) becomes a’A”*(v/"v!" — 1) = (A”” — a*) (A + A”)? where
2 1 2 72
a: = o (vy = 1)(1 — A" — A Js (3.6)

For any curve on the unit sphere the curvature vi’ v;” = 1. Also, as in Prandtl-Meyer
flow with leading edge v,(x), the normal component of velocity A” = a = 0. Assume
that the simple wave is an expansion. Then A’ (A 4+ A”) > 0, and

/

aA’ (v:

sl il) = (A ADAG = afl (3.7)


104 J. H. GIESE AND H. COHN [Vol. XI, No. 1

The initial values of A and A’ depend, of course, on the original velocity and orientation
of I.
The prototype planes through the origin satisfy

wi(wz; = 0. (3.8)

Join the velocity field (3.5), (3.8) to uniform flows at both ends. Let s be any streamline
not on (3.1) which does not intersect the envelope of the prototype planes, defined by

it — nip), nn; = nu; = 0, nn; = 1. (3.9)

Such streamlines exist if (3.1) and (3.9) do not intersect. As the second wall of the trough,
also composed of plane and conical segments, choose the cone through s with vertex P.
A special example of this type of flow can easily be derived from a Prandtl-Meyer flow.
Retain as one side of the trough the plane walls of the original boundary, and use a
conical stream sheet for the other wall.

4. A conical simple wave. Insert a half plane into a uniform supersonic flow at a
moderate angle of attack, and make the angle between the leading edge and the un-
disturbed velocity greater than the Mach angle. On one side there will be a swept Prandtl-
Meyer flow around the leading edge. On the other there will be an attached plane shock
wave behind which there will be uniform flow (supersonic if the angle of attack is not
too large) parallel to the half plane. Throughout the entire flow the component of velocity
parallel to the leading edge is constant. Introduce a coordinate system with origin on the
leading edge, z-axis parallel to the undisturbed velocity, yz-plane parallel to the uniform
flow behind the shock, and hence normal to the shock. Discard that part of the flow on
the side of the yz-plane that contains the downstream half of the leading edge. Reflect
the remainder with respect to the yz-plane. So far the boundary, shown in Fig. 1 together

side join continuously. On the expansion side u, is double valued in the yz-plane. This
difficulty can be avoided by modifying the upper side of the boundary as follows.
First, examine the hodograph of the swept Prandtl-Meyer flow. In Fig. 2 let ON*

be the undisturbed velocity in the yz-plane, and let N” be the projection of N* onto the
plane II that passes through the origin and is normal to the leading edge. During the
expansion, the component of velocity normal to II remains equal to NN* while the
component parallel to IT traces an arc NE of a Prandtl-Meyer epicycloid, shrunk by a
factor (1 — NN*°)"* Fig 1 shows that the z-axis is under the plane boundary, so the
angle AOE is acute. Hence the epicycloidal arc NE cannot have another intersection
with the line NS, parallel to OA. Now construct the hodograph by subjecting every
point of NI to the displacement NN.* Clearly, during the expansion from ON* to OE*
the angle between the velocity vector OU* and the yz-plane (IT) steadily increases
(decreases).

Now let A be the intersection of = 0 and the plane Mach surfaces that pass through
the leading edges and are based on the undisturbed velocity. Let P be any point on A.
From the nature of the hodograph it is clear that the streamline through P for the simple
wave In x 2 0 turns immediately into > 0 and stays there. Hence an entire conical
stream sheet through A bends into > 0. Thus it is possible to separate the two regions
of swept Prandtl-Meyer flow by means of a symmetrical conical fin, the thickness of
which increases with increasing sweep. Note that at the junctions of the fin and the
original boundary wu; is parallel to z; . Accordingly, near the corresponding points X,
(2.11) is of elliptic type. On the other hand, for very large values of X , near the boundary
(2.11) is of hyperbolic type.

To obtain from this boundary a finite obstacle resembling an airplane, symmetrically
terminate the wing, as in Fig. 3, at a trailing edge which is supersonic with respect to the
uniform flows adjacent to both sides of the wing. On the lower side there will be an ex-
pansion around the trailing edges. The flow field just described will be unaffected up to
the first Mach surface in the expansion fan emanating from the trailing edges. In par-
ticular, the leading edge shock will cease to be plane at its intersection with this surface.
On the upper side there will be a shock attached to the trailing edges, ahead of which

the original flow will be unaltered. If the trailing edges are straight, as in I'ig. 3, the
shock and immediately following flow for either half of the wing will be conical with
respect to the corresponding wing tip. Possible trailing edges for the fin would be its
intersections with the trailing edge shocks. If a thick wing is desired, the upper surfaces
need not be parallel to the lower surfaces. Finally the upper surfaces need not even be
plane, but may be cylindrical or even conical, with vertices at the wing tips. However,
after such changes the simple wave flows cease to be conical with respect to the origin.

5. Interaction of simple waves [2]. Return to the stage of the discussion at the end
of the first paragraph of Section 3. Examination of Fig. 1 shows that cross sections by
the planes z = + 1 would have the appearances of Figs. 4 and 5. Ez and E are traces

of the leading edges. The traces of the boundary and shock wave have been shown
mainly to clarify the preceding example. They really have no immediate bearing on the
interaction example, since it will be necessary to consider the possibility of having to
reduce the amount of expansion and the extents of the interacting simple waves. The

boundary will actually be constructed later. The essential point is that the discussion
starts from simple waves in which all of the straight characteristics pass through the
centers Ip or EF, .

In Fig. 4 the simple waves have not begun to interact so the boundary need not be
altered for z < 0. In Fig. 5 they begin to influence each other along the characteristics
ABg and AB, , shown in a magnified view in Fig. 6. Since the type of (2.11) is hyperbolic

at A, the characteristics actually extend some distance beyond A as shown. In the
simple waves u, and w are known on AB and AB, . Hence ® and d%/9X, are known
by (2.9). The characteristic initial value problem for (2.11) with these initial data will
have a unique solution in some sufficiently small characteristic quadrilateral ABrCB, ,
where C may be assumed to be on the Y-axis. Since the initial data are symmetrical
with respect to the Y-axis, so is ®. Extend ® beyond BC as the velocity potential of a
conical simple wave. In general, the corresponding straight characteristics will not be
centered. However, if the double wave AB;CB, is kept small enough, their envelope
and intersections can be kept arbitrarily close to E, , well beyond the boundary to be
constructed later. Between the two simple waves in X > 0 there falls a region of uniform
flow with the velocity u,.r of Br . Extend the definition of ® symmetrically with respect
to the Y-axis. Finally, between the two non-centered simple waves there falls a region
of uniform flow with the velocity wu; of C.

It remains to choose a boundary in z > 0. First let Uy , Usr , Us , and U denote
the points where rays from (0, 0, 0) parallel to wo , Wisk , Wizz , and u,3 Intersect z = 1.
Let Gp, starting from the right edge of the right hand non-centered simple wave, be
on the line ExU.x . Then u;,r is tangent to the corresponding plane through the origin.
Let F»Gr be an integral curve of the equation dX/(u — wX) = dY/(v — wY) of conical
stream sheets. The final part of the boundary in X > 0 consists of the segment FrU,
which corresponds to a plane to which u, is tangent. Extend the boundary symmetrically
into X < 0.

Note that near Us; (2.11) is of elliptic type.

It is interesting to observe that an alternation of double waves, simple waves, and
regions of uniform flow similar to that in Fig. 6 also appears in an intersection of simple
waves which occurs when uniform plane supersonic flow expands into an infinite sector.
This is shown schematically in Fig. 7.
