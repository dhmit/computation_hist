lurgist may look for equivalent or al-
ternate heating and/or working steps in a
process, or equivalent or alternate heat-
ing means in a furnace. And any mech-
anized system must be able to retrieve
those disclosures which show equivalence
as such, in some particular relation.

A patent claiming a rotary bearing
structure may disclose details of chem—
istry, of pressure molding and of lubri-
cation, all of which must be encoded for
retrieval.

Conclusions

It can thus be seen that the references
which must be retrieved through mech—
anized search are quite varied and dif-
ferent from those which would result
from a subject heading type of informa—
tion search. Although our concepts and
notions are often extremely broad in
scope, the interrelationships of their con—
ceptual parts are detailed and intimate,
while the particular characteristics of
each of these essential parts are neces—
sarily minutely present. And while these
categories of disclosure are seemingly
incompatible, they must be retrieved con—
currently.

Compounding (and perhaps confounding)
the problem, we must add the necessity
for generic and alternative searching
and many other requirements peculiar to
our problem.

Taken all together, the solution to these
problems will require:

1. Constructing, organizing and integrat—
ing a series of codes;

2. analyzing and encoding according to
these codes, at least 7 million dis-
closures in the Patent Office (each
with the large number of codes nec»
essary to set forth those features
of each disclosure for which some
searcher may later look); and

28

3. creating and designing methods of, and
apparatus for using, the precise and
intricate retrieval patterns required.

Concluding Notes

The isolation of a single specific dis—
closure for completely anticipating all
the claims of a patent application is a
rarity. Even then, an applicant may,
under certain circumstances, be allowed
to show that he can antedate a specific
publication, or some one or more publi—
cations may otherwise be found not to be
properly usable in a specified instance.
It would appear, therefore, that no search
in any scheme of mechanized search (as
in the manual searching now used by the
examiners) can be considered complete or
sufficient for anticipating an application
claim, if that search does not cover &
the known pertinent art. Applying this
particularly to mechanization, this means
ﬂ encoded disclosures in storage.

The specific examples of problems in
mechanizing the examiner’s search, which
have been mentioned herein do not, by
any means, constitute the sum total of
those which exist, but are merely rep-
resentative of the many which occur.
Many of the technical specialties, such as
electronics and organic chemistry, have
other problems peculiar to their subjects
matter. But in fulfilling the legal and
constitutional obligation placed on the U. S.
Patent Office, none of these problems can
be ignored.

The many helpful and constructive com—
ments and suggestions from other mem—
bers of the staff which have been incor-
porated into the final draft of this paper,
and the counsel and advice of the Direc-
tor, who aided in the selection of the ma—

terial here incorporated, are gratefully
acknowledged.
