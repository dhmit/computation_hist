other new directions, which involve mach

ihe use (meteorology,
nuclear reactor design

and the like) should be supborted by the
Center by grants of some time only while they are in the formative
stage, before they have been shown to be so obviously practical
that they can ask for financial support,for further computation,
in their own right. By the time they have developed their pro-'
grams and their special techniques of machine use, and are ready
to,exploit these methods by long "production runs", they should be
in a position to obtain financing to run these computations on

one of the several other similar machines which are or will be

in operation in the Vicinity.

Even with this sort of limitation on the use of the Center
facilities, the demands on the Center will grow. But the growth,
if thus limited, will, we believe, he a manageable one, in keeping
with what could be implemented by the cooperative effort of IBM
and MIT. A 7090 within the year would not delay most of the work
outlined above too seriously. And, as outlined below, it would
be able to handle them for several years, while plane are made
for the next step. On the other hand, if a 7090 cannot be provided
soon, several of the projects mentioned above will have to termin’
ate or else will have to use other machines, which would ineVn
itably mean the dissipation of the Center‘s usefulness in
coordinating this sort or research.

It is not intended that the Center should have a monopoly
of all computing around dIT; this would be unrealistic and, as
indicated above, impossible. But it must play an active role in
supporting and insti
