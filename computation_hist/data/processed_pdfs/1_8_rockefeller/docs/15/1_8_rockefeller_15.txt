Dear Dr. Buchanan:

Professor Philip MN. Morse, Director of our

Computation Center, has forwarded an application
to you for a grant in support of a machine
programming staff. This group will work on
utilization of electronic computers in the social
sciences,

The budget calls for an expenditure of $98,400
over a period of three years. 1 have reviewed
the proposed program, and would like to express
my whole-hearted endorsement of Professor Morse's
request. |

Sincerely yours,
