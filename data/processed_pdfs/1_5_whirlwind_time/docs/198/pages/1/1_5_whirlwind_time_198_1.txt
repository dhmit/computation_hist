Request for WWI time from the Arenberg Ultrasonic Laboratory

Attached is a description of a problem that has arisen in
some development work being carried on by the Arenberg Ultrasonic
Laboratory of Jamacia Plain, Ordinarily such a proposal from a
private group outside M,I.T. would be rejected since the problem
could be solved on commercially available machines. However, this
problem is of great interest to two Lincoln Laboratory groups whose
leaders have sent in confirming letters. As discussed in these
letters, the use of commercially available machines would limit and
retard the proposed program, Dr. Van Voorhis has suggested that Dr.
Reed of his laboratory might help in setting up the problem.

Because of the recommendations and beczuse we will have the
computer time available, it would seem that we could cooperate with
Mr, Arenberg in this project. The extent of this cooperation would,
of course, depend on whether Arenberg's method is feasible and
whether the amount of machine time required becomes excessive,

In addition to the general question of whether we should accept
this problem, there is also the question of whether we should require
full compensation for WWI time according to our rates now being estab-
lished, Mr. Arenberg has stated that under his present Air Force
contract he could spend up to about $2,000 on computation. Any fur-
ther funds would have to come from a new contract or from the interest-
ed groups at Lincoln Laboratory. Whether these additional funds could
be made available has not yet been determined.
