A PROPOSAL FOR THE USE OF A CONDENSED SYMBOLIC NOTATION ON
704 TAPES AND FOR THE USE OF CONDENSED SYMBOLIC CARDS

l. INTRODUCTION

The SHARE subroutines distributed to date total somse 30,000
instructions, and routines are being written at an increasing
rate. It is already impossible to put all the available sub—
routines on one library tape, and in any case a full library tape
would lead to excessive assembly time for programs calling for
routines coming from near the end of the tape.

By using a condensed symbolic notation it is possible to
store routines on a library tape at 20 to 30 times the present
density. (A count on a program sslected at random gave a factor
of 28, though this seemed to be a particularly favorable case, )
This increase in density is to be achieved by increasing the sigze
of the records used, trimming the comments from the Instructions,
omitting most of the REM instructions, and packing the instructions
continuously on tape with symbols to distinguish where one instruc-
tion leaves off and another begins. (At present a library tape is
written in .4 inch 80 character records with » 75 inch inter-record
gaps. )

Other proposals for library condensation have been made which
involve writing the instructions in relocatable binary form. We
think that there are many advantages to preserving a symbolic no-
tation. These include the fact that symbolic references to posi-
tions in the subroutines are allowed, and that subroutines with
program parameters set at the time of assembly can be used.

In addition we propose the use of condensed symbolic cards.
Programs on condensed symbolic cards will have from one sixth to
oné tenth the bulk of standard symbolic cards, and in the proposed
System they can be mixed with standard symbolic cards at assembly.
The condensed cards cannot conveniently be prepared by hand key-
punching, and a program to prepare them from standard decks has
been written.
