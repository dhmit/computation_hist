Dear Phils

During the past three years Martin Greemberger, John Korbel, Alice
Rivlin, and I have been engaged in developing a new approach to the analysis
and prediction of the behavior of soclo-sconomic systems, We have given many
tens of talks on our works, Three theses at Harvard have consisted of major
pieces of it, We have prepared many papers and several of these have either
been published or are in the process of being published, The most extensive
write-up of our work is Decision<Unit Models and Simmlation of the United
States Economy. I have emclosed a copy of this dralte Excerpts from

appear section 1.3 of the January 1958 report on Research and Educational
Activities of the Cooperating Colleges of New England,

Our work, in which the M,I,T, Computation Center has played such a
central role, has consisted up to this point of developing the gemeral
framework of this new kind of a model of a social economys of extensive work
on various pieces needed in such models; of development work on computer
techniques needed in estimating pieces of such models and in simlating
such models; and in writing and debugging a large-scale, specific program for
simulating a concrete demographic model of the United States household sector,

We are now at a critical juncture in our worke We are under contract
with Harpers to publish a book on our work and I have agreed to do a piece for
Scientific American, We had originally hoped to have this book completed by
Yast fall, but due to unforeseen programming difficulties, my move to Wisconsin,
and Alice Rivlin's joining the full-time staff of Brookings Institution, we have
been slowed up, We are extremely anxious to have our volume ready for the
printer by the end of the summer, This book, of which I enclose a slightly
out of date table of contents, is nearly completely written, The major remaining
gap is a critical one and consists of the chapter or chapters describing the
results obtained by a simmlation study of our demographic model, The specific
model itself is largely the work of Alice Rivlin and is our first really selfe
contained model of the United States Economy The specific computer program
for simulating this model was written and debugged by Martin Greenberger and the
group of three or four that worked under him, As far as we can tell, the
program is in good working order, What we need to complete this major phase
of our work is enough production runs to align our model with aggregative time
series datas to investigate some of its more important properties; and to use
it for making at least one or two runs for a few years beyond 1959, We estimate
that to do this on a satisfactory minimal basis will require approximately 100
hours of 70h computing times

We recognize that in asking you for 100 hours of time on the I.B.M. Toh =

computer at M.I.T. we are making a very substantial request, We hope that in
considering this request and ways in which it can be met that you will take
into account the enormous amount of work which we have put into this project,
At the very least this is a real indication of how much we believe in its long
run significance to the social sciences, We also hope that you will take into
account the many close and I think mutually beneficial connections that Martin
Greenberger, John Korbel, and I have had with the Computation Center at M.I.Te
and its development as the leading research center of its type, We also hope
that you will take account of the significant amount of attention and recognition
that is being given to the importance of work of the type that we have been
ploneeringe My appointment at the University of Wisconsin and the present
development of a large-scale Social Systems Research Institute here is just ome
concrete piece of evidence on this pointe

For purposes of testing the adequacy of our demographic model, aligning
it with aggregative time series data, carrying out sensitivity experiments,
and making limited projection runs we need about eight seven or eight year
runs and about two tem year runs, Since our ratio of machine time to real time
is just under 1,2 hours per year of real time this means that we need about
100 hours of machins time.

Enclosed you will find an internal memorandum of mine which discusses
the problem of studying and aligning models such as ours by simulation
techniques, It is entitled "Alignment of Model With Observed Aggregative
Time Series." The runs needed to carry out the described procedure will also
provide us with a critical set of sensitivity experiments.

Our hope is that the requested machine time can be made available to wus
in June end in July, Martin Greenberger would be incharge of our actual use
of the machine, but Korbel and I also would be in Cambridge and devote our full
efforts to successfully carrying to completion this work and in assisting Martin
in any feasible way.

We will be glad to have access to the machine at any time of the day or night
or on week-ends, We also would be glad to cover up to a thousand or so dollars
any extra costs that might be involved in operating the 704 on an extra shift
for a period of time,

Martin Greemberger and Johm Korbel will be available to help work out a
mtually satisfactory way of meeting our request, if yom wish to call upon thems
and if there is anything else that I can do to facilitate this matter, I am
anxious to do 80,

With best regardse
Sincerely yoursy
