Dear Mr. Jortner: ,
Professor Morse has rorwarded to me your letter

| reqneatins—inrornation on the solution of fourth order
biharmo

nic-type boundary value problems. I do not know anyone
who is solving such problems at present. However, it is
quite possible that one of the 500 problems now using maohine
time does 1nvolve the solution of auch problems,

If you could give me some more detailed information

~as to the source of ﬂns‘work, a rurther 1nvestigation would

be possible.

o I am enclosing a copy of the computation Center's
semi-annual report which has rather extensive lists of the
work being done at the present time. This may be or help
in determining proper references.

Sincerely yours; 5
