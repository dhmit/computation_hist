Memorandum Tog Professor G.S. Broun

 

From: Dr, A.L. Loeb

Subject: Appointment of P.M. Wiersema to the D.S.R. 7007 Project
to Apply the IBM 704 to the Problem of Electrophoresis

Date: 19 October 1956

PN. Wiersema is a graduate student in Professor J. Th. G. Overbeek's
Laboratory at the University of Utrecht, working on the phenomenon of
colloid eleÂ¢trophoresis. The first phase of the computations will be
completed by the end of 1956, having been programmed and coded for, and run
offi the ARRA computer in Amsterdem, partifally under the supervision of
A.L. Loeb. The subsequent phase of the calculations requires e machine
considerably more sophisticated then the ARRA, and it is proposed that
the IBM 704, to be installed at M.I.T., be applied to the problem.

Wierseme will take his Doctor's qualifying examinations in
December 1956, and will continue on the electrophoresis problem for his
doctoral thesis with Professor Overbeek, who has enthusiastically endoreed
Wiersema's spending a year at M.I.T. to acquaint himself with the IBM 704
computer. Professor Morse has indicated that computer time will be made
available for the project. Since Wiersema does not need academic credits
from M.I.T., a straight D.S.R. appointment would appear most logical.
Lincoln Personnel has not offered any objection to having a foreign
citizen on D.S.R. 7007 as long as the work is performed outside the
Lincoln Laboratory. A.L. Loeb is very glad to supervise end participate
in this research, which is of great fundamental interest, and recommends
Wiersema as a very capable and conscientious worker.
