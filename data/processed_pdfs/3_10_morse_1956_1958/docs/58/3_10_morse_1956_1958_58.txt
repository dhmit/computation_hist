Dear Sir:

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology submits
herewlth a proposal for extension of the reference contract to
June 30, 1957 at an additional estimated cost of $20,960.00.

We understand that this proposdl has been the subject of discus-
glong between Professor P. M. Morse of MI? and Mr, A. J. Wise

of ONR-MIT, Dr. Carl F. Mukenhaupt of ONR-Boston, and Dr. F. J.
Weyl of ONR--Vashington.

There follows & summary of expenditures and funds
remaining on the two projects, Whirlwind Operation and Machine
Methods of Computation, which are currently active under the

@ reference contract:

 

Project #6345 (Whirlwind Operation) hes an unexpended
balance of $97,000 as of November 30, 1955. The current expend-
{tures are approximately $10,000 per month. The average "income"
received for Whirlwind ugage is approximately $3,000 per month —-
a net expenditure of $7,000 per month. If it 1s assumed that the
present level of income ($3,000 per month) is maintained during
the nineteen-month period Decembsr 1, 1955 to June 30, 1957, a
minimum amount, assuming some tapering off, of $119,000 will be
required during this perlod.

Project #6915 (Machine Methods of Computation) has an
unexpended balance of $71,000 as of November 30, 1955. The current
expenditures are approximately $7,000 per month. If it assumed
thet the present expendi tures remain constant, there will be a
balance of epproximately $22,000 on June 30, 1956. In accordance
with our present plans for terminating the ONR support of this
project on June 30, 1956, there will be certain additional term-
inating expenditures. It is estimated that $7,000 will be
expended for termination purposes.

This summary is based on estimates prepared by Prof-
essor P. M. Morse.

& Professor Morse further advises that the expected
arrival of an IBM Type 704 Electronlc Data Processing Machine at
MIT about January 1, 1957 willl create a definite need for addl-
tional funds--to finance the conversion of existing Vhirlwind
programa to Type 704 programs.

Reference: Contract N5ori-06001 DIC-#63L45, #6915

Under the proposed plan submitted herewith, Project
#6345 (Whirlwind Operation) would terminate on June 30, 1957.
The task order for this period would include the usval Whirlwind
project activities:

1. Research in methods of numerical analysis and
the formulation of scientific problems for machine
solution, together with the training of personnel
in these methods.

2. Support of the Sclentific and Engineering Applica-
tions Group of Project Whirlwind so ag to make the
computer useful and avallable for the above-mentioned
regearch. |
In addition, 1% is proposed that the following task
order arising in connection with the Type 704 EDPM be included:

3. The development of a sultable interpretive program
and agsoclated coding technidues to permit effective
implementation of the Type 704 machine.

It is ans oupateg that a separate project will be set
up to handle the Type 704 utilization within the MIT Computation
Center, and a separate request to the ONR for support of this work
will be made in the near future. In this respect certein
experienced programmers could be made available for tranafer to

this new task as of January 1, 1957. This anticipated transfer

has been taken into account in the budget proposed for Project #6345.

The foregoing proposal does not take into consideration
termination costs which may be associated with the close out of
this contract and the possible disposltion of the Whirlwind Computer.
I% 1s propozed to delay the submittal of any budget for this matter
untill such time as disposition of the Whirlwind Computer is
determined.

The estimated budget for the period July 1, 1956 to
June 30, 1957 1s attached herewith as page 3.

Very truly youre,
