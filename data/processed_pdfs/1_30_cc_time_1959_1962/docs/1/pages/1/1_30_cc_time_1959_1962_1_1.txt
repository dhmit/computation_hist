7090 Computer Time Allocation

Herbert P. Galliher
Room 6-218
Mo T
M1339 Comparison of Methods of Forecasting Customer-Demands for Products

Time allotted for the period ending March 31, 1962, is 4.00 hours,

 

Dear Sir:

 

Above is the allocation of 7090 computer time for your pro-
blem for the first quarter of 1962, Although we expect that the
replacement of the 709 by the 7090 will result in a substantial
improvement in service, it is still possible that peaks in schedu-
ling and work loads may prevent you from realizing this grant.

If you have any questions about this allotment, either
Mr. Steinberg, the Operations Manager, or I will be glad to
answer them. If additional time is required, a request may be
made by letter explaining why it is needed. This letter should
be signed by the problem's supervisor and your MIT Department Head
or Institutional Representative.

Sincerely,

71, 0w
