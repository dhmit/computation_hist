This nae-erudi- is prepared with two objectives in ﬁnd. rirst.

, e brie! hietoricel background of the Rockefeller Differential Anelyner
(M) is presented together with epecific cments perteinin‘ to the
develop-eat period and pertinent fectors usocieted with its operation
during the pest twelve years. Second, the recent di-entlinc and
dispolition of the am is described in me detail. In the discussion
of the shove ital, frequent reference will he nude to several lune-end:
which have been prepared on the Iaehine during the pest decede.

I think it is inportant thet the Rockefeller Beeeerch roundetien
be properly infer-ed of the disposition of the Differential Anelyner
niece they were so helpful vith fimnciel contributione during its "
fen-native years.

The original design and develop-ant of the Differentiel Analyser
wes initisted early in 1936, and several of the henic feature. of the
nachine were deter-med at that tine. Specifically, the design of the
servo-echnniu eyst. which weaneed to interconnect the couponents of
the nechine wne developed during that period. Thin ie eentioned silply
to indicete that during recent yeere sole of the neintenence problems
unocieted with the RM were occseioned by the pnrticuler servnechenisle
which were .ployed. These were vintege 1936, end as such. were not .
eupetitive with poet-World Ier ll umechani- design.

The original Center of Annlyeie wen for-elly organized by Profesaor 8. H.
Caldwell in July. 1939 with the aid of e grant of $30,000 fro- the Cernegie
Foundation. During its early, foreetive peers, the Center existed lergely
on pants fro- the Rockefeller Fomdntion, Electrical lngineering Depart-ent.
and other sources; end it was not until 1942 that the am was finelly plsced
into oped-stion. Beginning et that tine, the RDA provided a source of
financial revenue which assisted in the for-ulation of e alt—supporting
rogue.

During 1941. the activities of the Center (under the direction of
R. Teylor) were expended to include a large battery of desk ealcnletore
and seeoeieted pereonnel who were well advanced in the nee of nuericel
analysis technique. At that tine. the Center centeined 3 principel types
of facilities:
