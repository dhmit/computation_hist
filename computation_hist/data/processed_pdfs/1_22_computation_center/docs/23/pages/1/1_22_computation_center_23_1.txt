Dear Professor Kememny:

Professor Morse has forwarded to me a copy of your informal

application for support of ®Symbolic Work on High Speed
Digital Camputers,”

The state of our finances at the mament makesit impossible
for us to determine whether we will be able to sponsor your
research, However, your proposal is of sufficient interest
to us to warrant your sending us a formal proposal covering
the first year of this research,

2incerely yours,

F, JOACHIM WEYL, Director
Mathematical Sciences Divigion
