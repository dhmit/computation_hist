Memorandum to: Dr., C. R. DeCarlo, Assistant General Manager,
Data Systems Division, IBM Corporation

From: Philip M. Morse, Director, MIT Computation Center
Sub ject: Replacement of TO4 by a 7090

Back Â¢ In June, 1957, somewhat less than three years
ago, an was installed at the Computation Center by IBM,

under a special agreement whereby IBM maintains the equipment,
contributes toward amortizing the additions to the Compton Laboratory
which house the Center and supports a number of research assistants

and assoclates who assist users of the machine, and MIT provides

the staff and operates the Center for the use of MIT and other
cooperating New England colleges and universities. The primary

purpose of the arrangement is to enable students and faculty of

these institutions to learn how t0 use high-speed cowputing machines
effectively, so that the next generation of scientists, engineers

and industrial executives will be able to exploit machine capabilities =-
in other words, the primary purpose is to demonstrate that such

machines are as important a part of the educational equipment of a
modern college as are chemistry laboratories, for example. A

secondary purpose is to foster research in the use of computing machines,
particularly in those fields of application which have not yet been
explored or exploited fully.

To this end, priority on 704 time has been accorded to
regular class use by courses in machine prograwmming and applications.
to students using the machine in their thesis research and to
research projects investigating new techniques of machine use.
Particular attention has been given to making it easy for the out-
of -town users: mwail service, special scheduling during visits and
Saturday operation for those who cannot come to Cambridge during
week days.

Present Situation: This program has been outstandingly
successiul: hence the present memorandum. Class use of the TO4
has grown rapidly; at MIT there is now a freshman course in machine
use, four upper-class and a number of graduate courses which use
time on the machine, in addition to the sequence of special coding
courses which are glven by the Center staff during each term and
summer. A number of other colleges bring some of thelr classes in
for one o more laboratory sessions. Class use will expand further,
