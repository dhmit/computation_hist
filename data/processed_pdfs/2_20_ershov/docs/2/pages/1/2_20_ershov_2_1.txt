Dear Professor Carr:

 

I send for your favor a copy of a letter sent today by registered air
- mail to J. Wegstein to the address indicated by you.

I am continuing to prepare for myself the possibility of coming to
see you. For much convenience I want to prepare the text of my
..ten lectures early. I would be very glad if you would state your

~ consideration for such an example of the plan of the lectures:

Introductory part: Historical Survey

First part: Automatic Programming
e —— e . A ettt et s et e -5 el et e G 8

The operational method and the first programming programs.
Programming programs for the machine STRELA. Algorithms of
optional programming. Automatization of programming of "'non-
mathematical problems. Certain problems of automatization of
programming.

Second part:. Theorstical Programming
Mathematical models of the languages of programming/algebraic and
geometrical approach. Results connected with problems of transformation
and equivalence of algorithms. Results connected with the notion of
algorithmitic completion of a system of operations. Certain problems

of theoretical programming.

I wo;zld like to ask you if it would be possible to translate the text of my
lecture into English upon arrival in the U. S. A. together with one of my
American colleagues. This request is optional since I could prepare the

English text myself; however, in this case it would contain many errors,
