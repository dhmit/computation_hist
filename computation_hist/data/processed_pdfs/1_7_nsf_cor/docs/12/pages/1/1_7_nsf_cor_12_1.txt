Mr. Roger P. Webber
Division of Sponsored Research
Room 5-105, M. I. T.

Dear Mr. wetter:

 

As I mentioned to you several weeks ago, I
have checked with the National Science Foundation and
round that the enclosed proposal for an extension of our
present project with a small additional increase in funds
is satisfactory with them.

I suggest therefore that you arrange for the
necessary signatures and make this proposal formal to the
Foundation. At the time we spoke you were not certain
that this proposal for extension of time would even need
Dr. Floe's signature. He is willing to sign, however,
if it is necessary.

I would appreciate it if you could get this
off since the Foundation is expecting it.

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse, Director
M.I.T. Computation Center
