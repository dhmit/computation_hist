ALLOTED 04600 HRSs DURING QUARTER ENDING JUNE 304 1958
Dear Sir:

This is to inform you that your problem indicated above has been
allocated the time indicated for the Second Quarter, April 1 - June 30, 1958,

I would like to again emphasize that the above alloted 704 machine
time iz applicable cmly during the period April 1 through June 30, 1938, If
additional machine time is needed during this quarter, a request for addi-
tional mechine time may be made by writing a letter to me asking for more
time ~-- explaining why it is needed.

it is necessary for you to justify your request because machine
time is becoming an increasingly precious commodity: For example, on
April 1, there wore three hundred fifty-three probleoms assigned on the 704.
This, naturelly, limits the maximum amount of time aveilsble to eany one
candidete, Indeed, we must ration machine time carefully and we would
appreciate your cooperation in using the machine effectively.
