Fortran/FAP Monitor System Changes

I. 'Recent extensive IBM changes to the Fortran/FAP Monitor System
were described in a letter from the Operations Staff dated March 20, 1931
which has been sent to all active programmers. The changes affect:

1. order of the run decks (symbolic now must precede all binary),

2, size of programs (program, excluding COMMON must not overlap
loader and its tables),

3. assignment of CHAIN tapes (A4 is now primary, Bl is no longer
used),

4, control cards LABEL, LIST8 etc. described in the latest manual
(C23-C054~2) which unfortunately, is not presently available.,

These changes will be instituted April 3, 1231. If you have any
questions, you should see the consultants before submitting your runs.

II. In addition to these changes, the Center has made several
modifications over the past two or three months, The following is
a complete list of all such changes since the last Bulletin.
