Dear Tommy:

In making the move to our new quarters in the Computation
Center, I unearthed a number of copies of tables which I believed to
have been out of print for a number of years, 1 am sending under
separate cover a copy of each of these tables, together with an esti-
mate of the number of copies of each which we have on hand,

I do not know whether it would be wise to advertise that
we have additional copies, for there are certainly not emough to
supply all interested parties, However, if you have one set in the
MTAC library and if it is possible for you to mention to those who
seem very anxious to get a copy that we might have a few spares,
perhaps we can distribute them to those who need them the most,

Â¥Yhat do you think?

Yours,

Philip M, Morse
Director
