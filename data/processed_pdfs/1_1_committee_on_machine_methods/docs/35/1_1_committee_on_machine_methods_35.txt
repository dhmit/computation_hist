Morse pointed out that the next two months were the time
to pick good men for research assistentehips for next year. From
four to six positions would be open.

Forrester said he had been asked by Dr. Smith of ONR whether
the Association for Computing Machines could have 1% spring (or summer)
meeting here. The Commitee felt that this would be approprlate and
agked Adams to Â£ind out whether the last half of Junie or the first
half of September would be preferred. When this is determined, an
official invitation can be issued and plans begun.

There was a further discussion of the E. E. courses lin
machine computation for seniors and first-year graduate students. The
Committee felt it was important that the one-term survey course, dis-
cussed at the last mesting, be given this coming term. It also felt
that a one-term course in punch-card techniques, at B level, should
be started next fall if possible.

Next meeting of the Committee will be at 2 p.m., Tuesday,
