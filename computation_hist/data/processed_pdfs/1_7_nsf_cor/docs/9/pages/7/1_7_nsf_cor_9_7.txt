8. Investigation of techniques for inter-communication
between computers, including the possibility of cycles different
in length or kind running simultaneously with frequent comparison,
e.g., several single-accumlatorcomputers with comon memory.“
the behavior of a computer with multi 1e acmlators. Some of

these properties can be simlst on a on by utilization of
additional drums and magnetic core banks.

9. Computer estimation of problem time. In linear problems,
estimations of bounds of certain mnctionala, and thence conver-

gence criteria for terminating iteration, or switching to a
different iteration.

Facilities:

The MIT Computation Center will have a Type 7018 Electronic
Data Processing Machine with the following machine complement:
12 magnetic tape units, 2 magnetic core storage units containing
a total of 8,000 words, 1 magnetic drum unit containing 4,000
words of storage, the usual on-line punched card reader, alpha-
betic printer, and punched caﬁ recorder as well as the 3 off—line
magnetic-tape-controlled printer, magnetic-tape-controlled
punch, and punched card-to-magnetic tape converter, respectively.
In addition to the 70“ there will be 10 auxiliary punched card
machines including card punches, collators, sorters, reproducers,
interpreters, and the Type 1&0 Accounting Machine. The aggregate
machérﬁe rental, in excess of 50,000 per month, will be donated
by . ,

The Type 704 EDPM unit is one of the fastest large-scale
commercial computers available today. Since. the MIT installation
will be but one of many in the field, techniques, programs, and
numerical procedures developed for this machine will be of use
to others having access to 704 equipment.

Pegsonne; - Supervisory and Administrative Personnel Associated
with the Progect:

Princigl Investigator to be Professor Philip H. Morse,
Direc or o the Computat on Center. He has been in contact with
computing problems during his career in theoretical physics since
1930,, and with the use of computing equipment since the first
Bush differential analyzer was available at MIT in 1936. He got
his Ph.D. in physics at Princeton in 1929 and has been at MIT since
1931, with occasional leaves of absence. His publications include
the books "Quantum Mechanics" (with E. U. Condon) 1930, "Vibration
and Sound" .1936” "Methods of Operations Research" (with G. E.
Kimball) 1950, Methods of Theoretical Physics" (with Herman
Feshbach} 1953, and "Queuing, Inventory and Maintenance" 1957,
and about a hundred Journal articles, many of which give results
obtained from machine computation. For further biographic details
see "Who's Who". Only a fraction of his salary will be charged to
the Project. -
