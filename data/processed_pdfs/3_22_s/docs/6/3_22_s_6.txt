Cambridge 39, Massachusetts --

Dear Sirs:

The Chemical Division of the Celanese Corporation of
America has recently established a Data Processing System. We
believe it highly desirable that the planning personnel attached to
this system become familiar with the techniques and principals of
the mathematical approach to the solution of business problems.

We would appreciate receiving from you a listing of
all short courses and conferences scheduled by your institution
in this area. We would also welcome any comments which might
help evaluate the worth to us of having representation at one or
more of these events.

Obligingly yours,

Lf deme
