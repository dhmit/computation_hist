THE DIGITAL COMPUTER AS A LABORATORY TOOL*{
(Electronic Digital Computation of Optical Constants of Thin Metal Films)

ARTHUR L. LOEB ano HARRY H. DENMAN

1. Introduction. An electronic digital computer at Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology, Whirlwind I, has been successfully applied to problems
concerning thin metal films. While the need for and results of the computa-
tions have been described elsewhere, [1, 2, 3], the present paper deals with
the computation techniques applied on Whirlwind I. Since the mathemati-
cal problem is essentially that of solving two simultaneous, complicated,
implicit transcendental equations, the methods employed may be of general
interest; the exact form of the equations involved is of minor importance

here.
In developing the program the following factors have been taken into
account:

A. Flexibility of application.

B. Ease of communication by scientists who are not familiar with Whirl-
wind I.

C. Ease of interpretation of the results by these scientists.

D. Automatic handling of large amounts of data.

E. Speed of operation.

F. Economy of storage in the computer memory.
The steps involved in putting such a problem on the computer are de-
scribed 1n some detail here.

2. The physical problem. The properties of thin metal films deposited
on thick non-absorbing backings are examined by measuring the reflectance,
R, and transmission, 7', of radiation nearly perpendicularly incident on
the films or on the backings. Two of these properties, the index of refrac-
tion, n, and the absorption coefficient, k, are related to the reflectance and
transmission by the following equations [1, 2],
