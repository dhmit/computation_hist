Dear Phil:

I have taken the liberty of answering your recent letter to
Nick Metropolls, since he is in Europe for a couple of months.

The consensus here seems to be that it would be perhaps over-
doing things a blt to have special meetings for directors of
University computing centers. One reason is that there are
relatively few of these people and the probability that they
have many important problems in common seems rather remote.
Perhaps something on the order of a private dinner at a regu-
lar ACM meeting for the directors would be more appropriate.
Besides, we give three cheers and a huzzah for your feelings
regarding proliferation of meetings.

Again lef me stress that these are not necessarily Nick's feelings
but Walter Orvedahl's and mine. I will bring your letter to his
attention when he returns.
My regards to the whole family.

Sincerely yours,

Han—

Manuel Rotenberg
