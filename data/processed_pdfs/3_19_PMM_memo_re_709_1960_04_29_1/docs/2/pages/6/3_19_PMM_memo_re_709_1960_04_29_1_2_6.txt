such computer capability, as well as all it implies, as part
of ‘a lecture room.

There is a further possibility of substituting com-
puters for teachers and having the computer "lecture", analyze
answers, and in effect modify its course of teaching based
upon a much closer feedback from the student than is possible
in a large lecture class. Such techniques can be more ad-
equately evaluated with the proposed time sharing system.

€. Real-Time Experimentation

In some systems, a need 1s developing for on line
measurement, computation, and feedback in order to more direct-
ly determine cause and effect. This is becoming increasingly
important in the area of analysis of neurological signals in
living animals. In addition, there are synthesis problems of
importance, for example the compositlion of such art forms as
music, using a computer as a tremendously flexible musical in-
strument. For that matter, many other "design" problems, par-
ticularly large systems are also in the realm of being an
"art" and can be aided and made into more of & Science by si-
milar techniques. Here again, however, there 1s a need to
provide a close feedback between the human and the machine.

The problem areas cited above by no means exhaust
the range of application for real-time and time-shared com-
puter usage. They were chosen to bring out both the range of
diversity of problems where human decision and machine de-
clsion can be mated very effectively to achieve far more than
elther by ltself.

Problems Raised by Real Time Computer Usage

Real time computer usage is worthwhile, but it raises a
host of problems that need solution. These problems lie gener-
ally in one of four areas, namely, systems, peripheral equip-
ment development, scheduling, and program development.
