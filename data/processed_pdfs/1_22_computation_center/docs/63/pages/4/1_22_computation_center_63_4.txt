more important during the beginning stages of the utilization of
electronic computers, when the problems are not too clearly formulated
and when neither partner in the team knows the others plans and
ideas. Later, when some of the more important potentialities have
been demonstrated, the research can be split up into projects, each
with a definite goal and with its own budget, which can include
partial support for the continuing staff of the Center. So, even-
tually, the Center could be financed indirectly by contributions
from each project which uses it, if this were considered to be the most
desirable way of keeping it going. At present, however, support Dy

Possible Initial Directions for Investigation.

As indicated, we cannot write down in any detail the
directions which this research effort will take, as the various teams
are formed and begin to interact. There are several general areas

which we feel should be investigated, whichﬁﬁammdaﬁ&#ﬂaﬁﬂ produce
results of immediate interest and which, in addition, should provide
hints as to still more important applications.

/A, One of these is the deeper investigation of machine logic
itself. A computer of the complexity of the 70L4- is too blg to be
able to see immediately how it can "think". Most machines are now
programmed to do ordinary arithmetic, =w€ a few programs have been

devised to make the machine obey the rules of Boolean logic and

some thought has been spent on working out programs to make the
