Extension of NSF 02940 Page 2

Plans for Next Year

All or these projects, and more, will stretch the capabilities
and energies of the Computation Center staff. We expect to add
two more senior staff members this summer and hope toporsuade two
men now completing their Doctor's degrees to stay on as Junior
staff members for a year or two. It is certain that mate! the
, research subjects outlined in our original proposal to NSF will
be begun this coming year; it can be expected that the NSF portion
of support for this work will reach the yearly rate of $35,000
as indicated earlier, and it is expected that this yearly rate
will continue at about the same level for several further years,
as was forecast in our original proposal (see Enclosure B).

We therefore request that Grant NSF 029140 be extended to
June 30. 1958, with additional ﬂuids of $13,000.
