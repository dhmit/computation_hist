Dear Mr. Kearns:

I am replying to a portion of your letter of January 12
which was sent to Proflessor Morse. In particular, you
indicated that you were interested in information regarding
advanced degrees in the fleld of electronic data processing.

At MIT advanced degrees are only awarded within the
established departments and at present there is none which is
exclusively related to computational techniques. However, most
of the ma jor departments and schools such as the School of
Industrial Management, the departments of Mathematies, Physiecs,
and Electrical Engineering have one or more professors who are
interested in computational problems.

Naturally, problems of electronic data processing with
reference to business problems are primarily of interest to
those in the School of Industrial Management. If a student
wishes to work toward an advanced degree, he must first be
admitted to one of the departments. Persons in the School of
Industrial Management who might be interested in data processing
problems of various types are Professors Forrester, Gregory and
Durand. Further information should be obtained by writing to
the department.

I hope the above 1s of some assistance.

Sincerely,

F. J. Corbato
