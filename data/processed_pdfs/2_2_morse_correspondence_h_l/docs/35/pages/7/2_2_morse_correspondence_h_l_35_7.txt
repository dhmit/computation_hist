7. Lallice Paramelers

If the distortion to tetragonal symmetry in MnzOjs is
due to the formation of square, covalent bonds about
Mn?t ions in the octahedral interstices, then the a-axis
is a measure of the covalent-bond length and the ¢-axis
is a measure of the ionic-bond length. If the cubic
symmetry above the transition temperature is due to a
resonance of the coplanar bonds among the three biaxial
planes of the octahedral interstices, then the lattice
parameter above the transition temperature is the
measure of a bond length which is % covalent and 3
ionic. At room temperature c=9.42 A and a=38.14 A,
so that the equivalent cubic lattice parameter 1is
ao=2a+1c=8.56 A. The coefficient of thermal ex-
pansion is estimated as

Aao/acAT =105 per degree.

Since @,=8.56 A, this gives Aaqo=0.09 A for AT
=1100°C. At the transition temperature, 1170°C, the
lattice becomes cubic with a measured lattice parameter
a'=8.64 A. The lattice parameter which is calculated
from the assumptions of square-bond formation in
Mn2t(Mn, )0y is ag+Aay=8.65 A. The agreement is
satisfactory.

C. The Indates and Metallic Indium

Passerini® has measured the lattice parameters of
Caln,O4 and CdInyO4. Each of these crystals was found
to be tetragonal; their respective axial ratios are 1.12
and 1.14. The cation distribution in these indates has
not yet been determined. MgIn;Oy4, on the other hand,
was found by Barth and Posnjak* to be cubic and in-
verse.

It is known that Cd!! tends to occupy tetrahedral
interstices where (sp®)-covalent-bond formation is pos-
sible. It may therefore be assumed that CdIn,O4 is
normal. Ca?t, like Mg*t, forms ionic bonds so that it
might be expected to occupy octahedral sites as do the
Mg** ions in MgIn,Os.

If the lattice distortions to tetragonal symmetry are
due to cation ordering in the octahedral sites, then
MgIn,O4, which is inverse and has the larger difference
in ionic radii (ionic radii of Mg**, In*t, Cd**, Ca*t are
0.78 A, 0.92 A, 1.03 A, 0.99 A, respectively), should give
a larger distortion than CdIns,O4 and Caln;O4. On the
contrary MglIn,Oy is cubic, and CdIn;O4 and CalnyOy
are tetragonal.

On the other hand, since the axial ratio of CdIn.Oy is
identical with that of ZnMn,O4, which probably has
(sp*) covalent bonding in the tetrahedral sites and
(dsp®) covalent bonding in the octahedral sites, it is
pertinent to inquire whether CdInyO4 can form the same
type of bonds. Although gaseous In** has a full 3d shell
so that square-bond formation appears improbable, a
study of metallic indium suggests the opposite.

B. GOODENOUGH AND A. L. LOEB

Metallic indium is face-centered tetragonal with an
axial ratio ¢/a=1.076.3 Since the lattice is distorted
from cubic symmetry, it is not possible to explain the
distortion by the interaction of the conduction electrons
with the lattice, i.e., by the interaction of the Fermi
surface with the Brillouin-zone energy-discontinuity
surfaces.?® In y-Mn, which is also face-centered tetrag-
onal but with ¢/a=0.937,%" it is possible to explain the
distortion as due to magnetic-exchange interactions,®
but such interactions are not present in indium. Also,
the indium distortion is in an opposite sense from that
in y-Mn.

In the usual discussion of energy bands in metals the
d, s, and p bands are considered separately. However, if
the d, s, and p bands overlap, a hybrid band would be
more stable. In metallic indium there is doubtless an
overlap of d, s, and p bands. It is suggested, therefore,
that there is a hybrid, covalent, (dsp?) band in indium.
This band is full with one electron per indium atom left
over for metallic bonding (see Fig. 3). If there is a
(dsp?®) band, it will be reflected in square covalent bonds
about each indium atom. The four nearest neighbors of
each indium atom are indeed located at the corners of a
coplanar square. It is suggested, therefore, that just as
in the case of tetragonal spinels, the distortion to tetrag-
onal symmetry in metallic indium is due to the forma-
tion of square covalent bonds. Further evidence for this
suggestion is given in Appendix IIT.

The study of metallic indium indicates that when
indium is in a lattice, the 3d electrons can be active in
bond formation. It is probably just as correct, therefore,
to consider the outer-electron configuration of In*t to be
d’ as to consider it d'°. When the steric constraints
favor (dsp?)-bond formation, the configuration d%
makes one d wave function available for hybridization
which can enter into coordinate covalence with four
coplanar oxygens as illustrated in Fig. 4. If In'!'! does
indeed form square bonds, then the square-bond model
is applicable to the indates. In'!! in an octahedral site
tends to cause tetragonal distortion through covalent
square-bond formation. Normal indates have, therefore,
tetragonal symmetry due to covalent square-bond for-
mation in the octahedral sites. On the other hand, In'!!
in a tetrahedral site tends to prevent tetragonal distor-
tion because its strong (sp*) bonds weaken the covalent
bonds 1n octahedral sites. T'his was shown in Sec. I11B,
w.here it was stated that the oxygen p orbitals are
directed toward that near-neighbor cation which forms

the strongest covalent bond with oxygen. In inverse
indates, tetragonal distortion is possible only if enough
octahedral cations form sufficiently strong covalent
square bonds.

Since In(MgIn)O, is cubic, there appears to be in-
sufficient covalent bonding in octahedral sites for tetrag-
onal distortion. There has to be a certain minimum
number of covalently bound ions in octahedral sites for
tetragonal distortion. This number depends on the
strength of these covalent bonds. In CuFe;O4 the mini-
mum number was shown [ Eq. (IV.4) ] to be 26 percent
of the octahedral cations. Since in In(MgIn)O4 the
octahedral covalent bonds are weaker than in Cule,0y,
the minimum fraction of covalently bound ions in
octahedral sites should here be greater than 26 percent.
In In(MgIn)Os each oxygen is surrounded by one
tetrahedral indium and three randomly distributed
octahedral indium and magnesium ions. Magnesium is
bound electrovalently. One oxygen can be bound co-
valently to one tetrahedral and two octahedral indium
ions through the admixture of oxygen (sp’) orbitals
(Sec. IIIB, and Appendix I). Since only 50 percent of
the oxygen ions have two octahedral indium near-
neighbors, only 50 percent of the octahedral indium ions
form significantly strong square bonds. This means that
only 25 percent of the octahedral cations can form
square bonds; as shown above this is insufficient to
cause tetragonal distortion.

It is concluded that all normal indates are tetragonal,
and that the inverse indates are cubic if the bivalent
cation is electrovalent. If the bivalent cation can form
covalent square bonds, the indate should be tetragonal

even when inverse. Therefore it is predicted that if
Culn,O4 or PdIn,O4 form spinels, they will be found to
be tetragonal, whether normal or inverse.

If the square-bond model is accepted for indates, the
axial ratio of CdIn.O4 must equal that of ZnMn,Oy, as
has been observed. In each case the spinel is normal,
and covalent bonds are formed in both tetrahedral and
octahedral sites, so that the axial ratio ¢/a=1.14 is
less than that of Mn3O4 (as explained in Appendix I).

Finally, the axial ratio of Caln,Os, c¢/a=1.12, is
greater than the extrapolated value for completely
inverse CuFe;04, ¢/a=1.08. Therefore this spinel can-
not be inverse. This conclusion finds further support in
the fact that if it were inverse, it would not be distorted
because Ca*t forms electrovalent bonds. The axial ratio
¢/a<1.16 is due to incomplete covalent bonding in the
octahedral sites. If this indate were completely normal,
this weakening could not be due to covalent bonding
in tetrahedral sites. It is concluded, therefore, that
Caln,O4 is partially inverse; the concentration of
covalently bound cations in octahedral sites is then less
than that in the spinels with axial ratios 1.16 and 1.14,
and the presence of In in both octahedral and tetra-
hedral sites causes a further reduction in axial ratio.

It is significant that gallates are cubic and that
metallic gallium does not have the close-packed, tetrag-
onally distorted structure. Apparently gallium, like
mercury, tends to form pairs of atoms, presumably
through (1/3)s+ (1/V3)p.+ (v/5/3)d: hybrid orbitals.

H. Summary

In Table III there is a summary of the properties of
those spinels which become orthorhombic or tetragonal.
The orthorhombic-Fe;O4 transition is seen to be quite
separate in character from the tetragonal transitions.
The orthorhombic distortion has been definitely es-
tablished as due to ordering of the octahedral Fe** and
Fed+ cations. The distortions due to ionic ordering are
believed to be orthorhombic rather than tetragonal.
