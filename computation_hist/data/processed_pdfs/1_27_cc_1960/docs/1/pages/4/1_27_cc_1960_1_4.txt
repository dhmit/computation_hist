should be of particular interest to IBM, for they have direct
bearing on the progress of computer design and utilization. They
represent the sort of cooperative research between experts in
different fields which MIT does so effectively, and they involve
the combination or research and education for which MIT is pre»
eminent. This work deserves support by IBM, in addition to the
educational activities which are already being supported by the
present contribution of the 70k. They can most effectively be
supported by the installation of a 7090, replacing the 704, in
the near future; MIT will then be able to provide the ancillary
equipment to ush ahead with dispatch. Because of the "inter-
connectedness' of much of this research it can best be carried
out (perhaps it can only be carried outs in the atmosphere of
mutual cooperation and exchange of information provided by the
Computation Center.

Outlook for the Future: The activities mentioned above
are only a part of the researchy at MIT and at the associated
institutions; which desires to use the facilities of the Computation
Center. Obviously no single computing machine can be itself satisfy
indefinitely the continually growing demands from the New England
educational institutions, for all their research and educational
computer needs. However the facilities of the Center need not,
and probably should noty satisfy all the demands. A much more
realistic task would be to concentrate on 1) the educational tasks»
which will be supplemental to the onecampus small machines for the
other New England colleges and which, for the MIT class needss can
be improved in efficiency by timeosharing techniques; 2) on thesis
research and 3) on Just those aspects of research which advance the
design2a programming and utility of the computer in new fields.
Research programs in other new directions, which involve machine
use (meteorology; nuclear reactor design and the like) should only
be supported by the Center by grants of time while they are in the
formative stageg before they are far enough along to be able to
ask for financial supports for further computation, in their own
righto By the time they have developed their programs and their
special techniques of machine use; and are ready to exploit these
methods by long "production runs'}9 they should be in a position to
obtain financing to make these runs on one of the several other
similar machines which are or wi 1 be in operation in the vicinity:
