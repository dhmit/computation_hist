The Committee approved the recommendations of the Physics
Department that
F. J’. Corbato

M. C. Hewstein
G. Speismen
L. S. Frishkopf

be appointed half—time Research Assistants in Applied Mathe-
matics and Machine Computation for next year (Corbato beginning

June). Mathematics and Electrical Engineering, candidates will
be reported on next week.

Horse reported that Kopal's ONE contract for next year has
been approved and will be supervised by Jacchia.

Kopal reported that the Electrical Engineering Department
wished to hear the Committee's opinion on the continuing or
Valet-man's course in machine coding next year (Welshman has
left the Whirlwind project). The Comittee felt that such a
course is an important one and that it should be continued. Per-
haps Adams of the Whirlwind project could give it next year.

Morse reported that the Industrial Liaison Office (Mr.
Bevans) desired to fix the program and date of the proposed Con-
ference on the use of Large-scale Computers in Industry. The
first week in May appeared to be a good time. Subsequent talk
with Mr. Bevans indicated that Wednesday—Thursday, May 2—3,
would be the best days. The proposal is to have Morse, Verzuh
and Adams talk the first morning on the general question of
machines, what they were and how they could be used. Wednesday
afternoon could be spent in hearing about the DA and visiting
it and Thursday mornim could be spent hearing about and seeing
Whirlwind (though this order could be reversed). Bevans would
