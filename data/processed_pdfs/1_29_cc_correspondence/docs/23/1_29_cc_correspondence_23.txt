709 Computer Time Allocation

HOLDING TIME

Time allotted for the period ending June 30, 1961 is 0.50 hours.

Dear sir:

Above is the allocation of 709 computer time for your problem
for the period April 1, 1961 through June 30, 1961. The Center, by
modifying its scheduling policies, extending its daily and weekly
operating periods and improving the FMS programming system, has so
far managed to keep pace with a demand which has doubled in the last
six months. Past experience has shown that this quarter, however,
because of thesis deadlines and the other end-of-the-year deadlines,
has always produced the largest demand for computer time. It has,
therefore, been necessary to scale down most allotments. We must
again warn you that, unless you schedule your computer usage over the
quarter, work-load peaks may make it impossible for you to realize
this allotment.

Sincerely,

/
F. J. Corbato
Associate Director
