languages developed for the overall system.

"
The "scheduling" aspect will have 1ts effect on a super-

visory routine; each type of peripheral device will require 1its

own input-output routines. Alsc dispatching and monitoring

routines will have to be developed for the system.

Progress to Date

Time sharing and multiprogramming are not new techniques
to the M.I.T. Computation Center. Since early in 1959, an
electric typewriter has been connected to our IBM 704, and has
been used in a time sharing mode for a varilety of purposes
including monitoring and modifying heuristic programs, analyz-
ing and debugging programs, and running programs in a variety
of specialized languages. Special programming systems have
been devised to assure that when the 704 is multiprogrammed,
the programs can coexist and run independently.

In addition, the Center has developed and installed
many special purpose devices such &8s an "alarm clock"‚Äù to test
out the feasibility of equitably divliding time among users
and accounting for 1lts usage.

Elen of Appreach

The overall direction of this project is under Professor
Herbert M. Teager of the Electrical Engineering Faculty and
Computation Center Staff. Assoclated with the project will
he Professor John MeCarthy, and Dr. Fernando J. Corbatd and
Drr. Michael Barnett of the M.I.T. Computation Center Staff.

Additional personnel will be recrulited for the project
from the M.I.T. Staff.

Although 1t is difficult to completely specify the

exact schedule of when the various research phases of the
project wlll be completed, 1t 1s expected that the timing
will be about as follows:
