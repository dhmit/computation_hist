Dear Mr . Morse :

We should like to thank you for working with us in arranging our
program called ELECTRONIC COMPUTERS FOR PROBLEM SOLVING of May 21-2-3.

We sorted out pretty carefully the different authorities on various
computer subJects that were suggested to us. We found that we had the
makings of several computer conferences, each one of them better than

orientation or information about computers for problem solving. Later
programs will get into continuous application, and then others will
take up operating considerations, and etc.

We do appreciate you: having helped us put together the beginning of an
interesting series.

Cordially yours ,
