Dear Sir:
I am enclosing in triplicate a brief description of
the problem involved in calculating optimum design for delay

lines for your consideration, in hopes that the problem may
be considered worth doing on the Whirlwind Computer.

QO 30 yours,

THE OPTIMIZATION PROCESS IN THE CALCULATION OF ULTRASONIC DELAY LINES
Submitted by
Devid L. Arenberg

Ultrasonic Delsey Lines have come into important applications
during the last decade as memory devices in radar systems and high
speed computers. In the former field, no other successful device has
yet been developed which will give the seme degree of stability and
linearity of response for the large storage times and bandwidths
needed in moving target indicators and integrators.

The conditions of service for electronic devices in national
defense work requires that all components be of minimum size and
weight, so that a very difficult problem arises in the highly refined
ultrasonic delay line designs where one is required to fold the path
of a sound beam for a 1,000 usec delay line of over 12 feet within a
6 inch circle without any deterioration of performance. Since the
path length is proportional to the delay time, while the volume of
materizl used is proportional to the square of the diameter of the
minimum cirele in which o setisfactory design can be placed, the prob-
lem of obtaining an éptimum design becomes of extreme importance with
the longer delay times in the range of 3,000 microseconds, where with
present techniques a piece of stock over 16" diameter is needed. A
savine of 15% in diameter is possible and would result in a weight
reduction of 32%.

z Without going into the details concerning the method of designing

eo. delay line or establishing the optimum relations, one can state that
3 a. system of simultaneous linear equa-

tions can be set up which involves all
the dimensions and angles of the plane
figure used for a preliminary design,
and that these simultaneous equations
can be solved in a manner (0 improve
the performance.

For example, i ig.l shows the geometric path in a simple 3 x 4
rectangular design, with sides A, B, 0, D, BE, FP, the solid dark line
being the central ray from the gransmitter to receiver and the dashed

colored lines the upper and lower limits.

 

Figs 2 Sound Beam Path extended in Image space to Show upper and lower
limits of Sound Beams.

Fig.2 shows the sound beam path extended in a straight line in
image space with the upper and lower limits from the transmitter. The
upper and lower limits of each reflection surface will be determined by
the intersection points with ed jacent facets, and are labeled H. 1°P gang
H, Bottom, Thege limits determine the effective apertures of the delay
line, and how much of the energy Originally directed toward the receiver
will reach it. Any energy striking an adjacent facet will not only be
directed away from the main image at position 6, but can follow an alt-
ernative path to another imake of the receiver, such as C af HoB where
a. secondary signal may appear. These secondary signals appear at times
proportional to the distances from the transmitter on the image space
diagram and their amplitude relative to the main signal always limits
the performance available. While the total energy lost in these side
reflections is very small, and may be less than 85% of that received at
the mein delay, a single secondary image of 1% is not tolerable in pres-
ent redar applications.

Hence, the problem of optimizing the shape of a delay line for g
given design consists of adjusting the apertures so that the minimum
limits either in the top or bottom series has the maximum possible value.

The procedure for ensuring that the adjustment of one dimension to
remove one limit does not allow another point to decrease below the
danger value is as follows:

The intersection points of the facets on either side of the
reflection facets are determined from analytic geometry, and
a system of nearly linear simultaneous equations obtained
involving the distances R; from a common center to the facets
A, B,C, ebc., and constabt coefficients Aj which are trig-
onometric functions of the angles between ad jecent facets and
the angles of incidence in Fig.2.
