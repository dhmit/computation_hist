party 3 an very interested in’ yous otter of May 23 in which: you
Susie your desire to program your interesting problem on our machine,

| 1 very much regret to inform you that our machine is not

available for problems outside MIT, Whirlwind I is. subsidized by an
Office of Naval Research contract and ve are not allowed to use if for
work outside the Institute, :

in Came YOu BTS Tot aware of it, I would 1ike to call your
attention to the 704 program which we are setting up at MIT, and in
particular, point out to you the cooperative program which exists
between Yale and MIT on the use of the 704. Specifically, Professor
Woerksom has been appointed as the Yale MIT representative and you
should contact him rogarding details of this program, The important
thing, however, is that you will be able to use the 704 machine ag soon
as it is available (January 1, 1957?) at no charge. I, therefore, suggest
that you become familiar with the 704 coding and the 704 classes which
are te be held this summer and fall at MIT, Again, Professor Woerksom
has complete information on this. |

I am looking forward to seeing you here at the lanstitute using
the 704, In the ‘meantime, if we can be of any help, please let us know.

Sincerely,

F. M, Verzuh, Head
