Dear Professor Morse:

The forthcoming National Conference of University Computing
Center Directors was discussed at the December 18-19 Conference
of University Computing Centers of the Southwest in Tucson, Arizona.
There was general agreement on one item, - a wish that the five
Sessions be held in sequence rather than in parallel, so that each
Director would be able to attend all of the Sessions.

 

 

 

I suggest that this may be done, if the Chairman and the
Secretary are so minded, by imposing on each Session Chairman
the requirement that he start and finish his session on schedule.

In my own case, I am constrained to attend the Session on
Computing Service to University Departments, but my interests
are equally great in Computer-Oriented Research (Session 2) and
Curriculum and Instruction (Session 3).

Enclosed is an extra copy of the Questionnaire which I have
mailed out, which you may keep. Another, to be returned to me, has
been mailed separately.

Yours truly,

Enclosure


Dear Sirs

The following Questionnaire is intended to obtain data for discussion at
the Session on Computing Service to University Departments at the first
National Conference of University Computing Center Directors, on June 2
3, and 4, at Chicago. It is requested that you reply before May 13. if
possible, so that the data can be prepared for present ation.

0

Since replies will not be treated as confidential, a check box is provided
for "NC" ("No Comment’).

The Questionnaire is in two parte. The first part is concerned with your
present operations. The data from this part will permit you to compare
your service operations with those of other computing centers. The second
part is concerned with your opinions of how a computing center can and
should be operated.

It is expected that the findings from Part I can be reported at the Session

as factual information, with little discussion. It is hoped that the opinions
expressed in Part IX will lead to profitable discussion, particularly to reveal
what has proven satisfactory and what to avoid in service operations.

Where questions are concerned with charges for use of the facilities, the
following abbreviations are used:

FREES Services performed without expectation of payment.

RESDS Full or partial payment of charges is expected from
residual funds (i.e., of $x available for a research
project, Sy are left after necessary expenses.
Computing services are performed, for which $y are
not sufficient. You do the work, accept the $v, and
absorb the remaining cost.)

PREF: Services are performed at a preferential rate, as for
a faculty member writing a textbook, or for "public
relations” for a Chamber of Commerce, 2 corporation
which gives scholarships, or a police department.

FULLS The user pays the full cost (or more) for the service |
performed.
INDV¢ The user employs individuals with whom he makes

arrangements for compensation.

Yours truly,

11.2 How does one iistinguish between "free" and "paying" users ?
