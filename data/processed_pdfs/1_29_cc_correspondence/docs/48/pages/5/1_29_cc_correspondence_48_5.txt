Error Return
SLW (normsl return)
This routine writes the block of N words starting et FWA on MT-NINE

and computes the CAD checksum, Tape is then backspaced and reresd to

check for a legible record, Fablure of the check causes g second writing

end check, failure of which causes error return., On normal return, CAD

checksum is in AC to be stored for later use with BLINS, By | o 4o

Normel Return
Thie routine reads the next block of N words from MT-NINE into core memory
