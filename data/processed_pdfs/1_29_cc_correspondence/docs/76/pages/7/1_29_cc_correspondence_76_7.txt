the tape on which the chain link is to be kept at

execution time. T must be literally either Bl, B2

or B3 and not the corresponding logical tape numbers.
R is a fixed point number greater than O but less

than 32768 denoting a label for that link, identifying
it when it is called. (NOTE: The designations Bl,
B2, B3 must be observed in tape input-output state-
ments only. The sequence in which links are stored
for any one link tape is in no way determined by the
number, R. The sequence follows from the relative

position in the input deck.)

b. The last executable statement of a link which is to
call a succeeding link for execution must be of the

form,

CALL CHAIN (R,T).

(Here T must be a logical tape number corresponding
to/Bl, B2 or B3.)

This will then cause the link, which at compilation
time had been specified by the control card,

CHAIN (R,T)
to be read into cores and executed.
Selection of Tapes for Link Stacking.
Chain links may be stacked on tapes Bl, B2, B3 for object
time execution. The selection of tapes may be a function
of object time needs to minimize tape reading time. For
example, if it is desired to execute the links once only

and in succession, they may be placed in that order on one

tape. If one of these links, however, is to be executed
