Dear Professor Morse,

Here is a copy of the Preliminary Program for the meeting of
New England members of the American College Public Reletions
Association, showing the session at the Computation Center

on Thursday morningjmggnugrng. I hope what you see written
seems appropriate.

I do not have any record of whether you have planned to join
the group for lunch at the Faculty Club, though I have a

feeling we have had some discussion of this. I hope you will
plan to do so.

I have asked for an indication on registration materials of
how my ny may want to attend the Computation Center program,

and I will keep you posted of the result as the time draws
nearer

Meanwhile, my thanks for your help — and best wishes for the

110 ioiay S.
