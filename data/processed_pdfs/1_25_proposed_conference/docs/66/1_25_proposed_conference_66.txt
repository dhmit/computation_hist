Dear Dr. Freiberger:

I have received your letter of November 25 about the possibility
of holding the meeting of University Computing Center representatives
in the Chicago area. I can offer the Northwestern University Campus
in Evanston Illinois as a site for this meeting. I am sure we can

find all the facilities such as hotels without any trouble what so
ever.

Evanston is located on the North side of Chicago and is in a

good transportation center to Chicago. If you think this is what you
want let me know and we can get started on it.

Yours truly,
He. Rymer
â€˜Director, Computing Center
