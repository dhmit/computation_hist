Subject: Tape and Drum Post-Mortems in the Operator Program
bys Sheldon Best and Frank Helwig

ies a a
The post-mortem routine contained in the operator program

should be able to post-mortem tapes and drums. The following
abilities are proposed: |

1. Requests for Wrum-nost-nortens should be exactly
like core memory requests except for the mode designator
DR n n= 1,2,3,4
2. Requests for tape post-mortems should have the mode
designator
MT n ne O,1,000,9
and should have an extra (fifth) address of the form
W E E.,OR EOF
(REM) (Ca (FaÂ°F, BOF) (FoF 2OF)

where E. and E, denote expressions, The first three parts of
this address abe used to position the tape:

(a) (REW) is optional and rewinds the tape.

(b) (Ea OR =r) specifies that the tape be

spaced (forward or NE ither E. records or to the nearest
end-of-file gap (whichever occurs first).

The final section of this address specifies that elther
records be processed or that records be processed up to an
rs gap (whichever occurs first). The words within the
record to be printed are specified by the first and second

addressed (as for regular core memory requests).

It is tentatively proposed that the recording of Tags in
location fields be surpressed during tape and drum requests.
