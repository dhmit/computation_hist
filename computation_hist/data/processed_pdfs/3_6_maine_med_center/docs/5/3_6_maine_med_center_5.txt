ON THE ELECTROCARDIOGRAM

In the theory of the electrocardiogram, the heart is
assumed to act like a current generator immersed in
a homogeneous conductive medium. The concept of a
homogeneous medium has been subject to criticism.
Many studies have been made. for example, of the pos—
sible effect of the lungs. Although published ﬁgures for
the electrical resistivity of the lungs vary widely, model
studies have shown that even if the lungs had a resis-
tivity four times that of the other tissues, the maximum
error in any surface potential would not be more than
20%. Another factor which might invalidate the homO<
geneous medium idea is the presence of the blood in the
heart chambers. The electrical resistivity of whole blood
is much lower than that of muscle and other thorax
tissues. According to Schwan and Kay,1 the ratio is
only 1/10. This ratio is considerably lower than that
reported by other workers; usual values are one to four
or ﬁve. The effect of a highly conducting mass near a
current dipole can be studied most simply by means of
the method of electrical images.2 Brody3 showed that
the effect of a spherical cavity ﬁlled with blood would
be to increase the ﬁeld potentials if the dipole axis is
normal to the sphere (radial dipole), or to derreuse the
potentials if the dipole is tangential to the sphere.

Previously reported experiments‘ with an artiﬁcial
dipole within the ventricular cavity indicated that the
effect of the ”shunting" action of intracardiac blood was
to reduce the electrocardiographic potentials by about
25%. In the experiments reported here, we have placed
the dipole inside or across the myocardium in an effort
to reproduce physiologic conditions more closely. Two
approaches have been made: (a) Electrodes were in-
serted in the myocardium of exposed lire dog hearts in
situ, and subthreshold stimuli were applied. The stimu—
lus signal was recorded during systole and diastole, in
order to see it the changing blood volume caused a. varia-
tion in amplitude. (The difference was only about 10%.
This small difference was possibly due to the relatively
large residual blood volume.) (b) The hearts were
removed, and after the inﬂow and outﬂow vessels were
cannulated, they were placed in a tank modeled after
the human thorax. The tank was ﬁlled with saline ot'

resistivity 1000 ohm-cm. Saline of the same resistivity
was perfused through the heart, followed by a solution
having the resistivity of whole blood. The deﬂections
produced by the artiﬁcial dipole in the two cases were
compared. In addition, the etIect on the dipole of a
metal sphere in the tank was tested.

Figure 1 shows the results of an experiment in which
two platinum disk electrodes were sutured on the epi-
cardium of the right ventricle of a heart immersed in

the tank. The curves show the distribution of potential
around the wall of the tank at mid~ventricular level, as
measured by a series of dis (5 permanently mounted in
the tank wall. $45.7 cm corresponds to the center of
the back, and zero cm corresponds to the center of the
front wall (mid-sternal line). The effect of the low-
resistivity ﬂuid is to reduce the amplitude of the poten-
tials all around the wall. The tabular insert shows that
unipolar and bipolar limb leads are also reduced. Be—
cause of this more or less uniform reduction, the angle
a is virtually unchanged. (a, deﬁned as the angle
between the spatial vector and the horizontal plane, is
used in preference to an, the Einthoven angle, since
all components of the vector are thereby taken into
account."’)

Figure 2 is for a similar experiment with a trans-
mural dipole in the left ventricle, where the estimated
angle of the dipole with the myocardial wall was 70°.
The effect of the low—resistivity tluid is now to increase

the magnitudes the wall potentials, measured with re-
spect to a Wilsc>n central terminal, over most of the
right side of the tank, to decrease them near the center
and part of the left wall, and to increase them again
over much of the left side. The locations of the null
points are also changed. The table shows that all. limb
leads are increased with the exception of VL, which is
reduced in magnitude. Since ,8 (see ref. 5) is only
—10°, a: and a, are very nearly equal. a, is changed
from ~24° to ~51° by the low-resistance ﬂmd.

Table l, for the same experiment as ﬁgure 1, shows
the effect on the limb leads of the low—reSIStance ﬂuid,
when a transmural dipole was used. One of the chi-1%
culties encountered in these tests was the gradual low-
ering of the heart tissue resistance itself With time after
death. However, the data of column 2 were taken ﬁrst,
followed by column 1 and then 3, so that the error from

this cause would tend to make the differences between
the potentials with the two ﬂuids smaller rather than
larger. In order to standardize the records, they were
scaled down to correspond to a dipole exc1tation strength
of l ma-cm. The low resistance ﬂuid causes an apparent
change in the angle a of 35".

With a tangential dipole, there is a uniform lowering
of ﬁeld potentials with the low resistance ﬂuid, but for
other angles, the potentials are increased in some areas
and decreased in others. These results can be readily
visualized by means of the method of images, e.g., for :1

radial dipole, the image dipo e inside the highly conduct-
ing sphere will be pointed in the same direction as the
external, real dipole. The image dipole will therefore
reinforce the real dipole at most points, but in a region
between the two dipoles, the image will counteract the
real dipole.

These effects were shown more strikingly in the ex—
periments with a metal sphere in the tank. Although
the resistance of metal is very much lower than that of
electrolytes, it can be shown theoretically that the effect
of the metal sphere on ﬁeld potentials should not differ
too greatly from that due to a sphere having a resistivity

 

one-tenth that of the surrounding ﬂuid. Figures 3, 4,
and 5 show the horizontal wall distributions for dipoles
at angles of 0° (tangential), 45° and 90° (radial) to
tie surface of the metal sphere Curves E, O, and J,
with the sphere out of the tank or at an inﬁnite distance
from the dipole, correspond to a homogeneous medium.
n each case, the dipole was kept ﬁxed in position. and
ie sphere was moved away from the dipole. The effect
f the sphere becomes greater as it approaches the dipole.
In view of these results, we conclude that the presence
of the relatively highly conducting blood inside the heart
eiamhers may have a signiﬁcant effect on the valves of
the recorded potentials. We also postulate that the fact
tiat subepicardial potentials are recorded with much
smaller amplitudes than epicardial potentials may he
explained by (a) their greater distance from the record»
ing electrode, and (b) by the greater shunting effect of
tie cavity blood on these components. This would cer—
tainly be true for any tangential spread of excitation on
tie endocardial surface, but for a purely radial
the potentials should be increased.
