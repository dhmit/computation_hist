APPROACH TO MARKOFF’S MINIMAL FORMS
THROUGH MODULAR FUNCTIONS

By Harvey Conn!

(Received March 26, 1954)

1. Introduction

In 1879, Markoff (7, 3]" derived, by means of continued fractions, an infinite
sequence of integral indefinite binary quadratic forms whose minima are greater
in absolute value than one-third the square root of the diseriminant. The method
of continued fractions provides probably the most direct approach and was
used even more intensively as the subject of diophantine approximations de-
veloped [6]. Nevertheless, a parallel development was started by Frobenius
[5, 2] in 1913, using properties of quadratic forms. In between, however, in
1896, Fricke [4] had considered groups of substitution matrices generating
fundamental domains of genus one in the upper half plane. In setting up group
generators, Fricke had made use of identities of the type:

(1.1) S(A) + &(B)’ + S(4AB)’ = S(4)S(B)S(AB) + S(ABA'B™") + 2
and
(1.2) S(BAB) + ©(4) = S(B)S(AB),

where A and B are real unimodular matrices and & is the trace. The verifica-
tion of these identities is straightforward, (compare (1, pp. 472, 481]), yet the
close resemblance of these identities with Markoff’s equation and its recursion
formula, (equations (5.5) and (5.3 bis) below), seems to have somehow escaped
notice.

In this treatment, we give a new derivation of Markoff’s minimal forms, char-
acterized by arithmetic restrictions on Fricke’s problem.

 

 

 

2. Fundamental Domain
We start with a fundamental domain of genus one in the z-plane belonging to
some group G with a specific representation in r »al unimodular linear substitu-
tion matrices, denoted as follows:
