Dear Phils

This will confirm our conversations by phone on January 21
and during your visit on January 23, Through them I learned
that your committee, appointed by Paul A. Smith, Chairman of the
Division of Mathematicsy NRC, urged NSF support of the computation
of a one volume set of mathematical tables to meet current
computing needse It is my understanding that your committee feels
that the Applied Mathematics group at the Bureau of Standards is
eminently equipped to prepare the tablese I look forward to the
formal report of your committeecs

In the meantime, you may be interested to know, the Advisory
Panel for Mathematical Sciences, NSF at its meeting on January
20=21 encouraged the negotiation of a proposal to produce such
tables on the ground of their value for basic research,

It would seem that the way is clear for the submission of a
proposal to carry out this worke

Sincerely yours,
& P
Ieon We Cohen

Mathematical Sciences
