‘Dear Prof. Hartreet

' - I am glad to hear that you are coming here this
sumner and I hope that you can spend some time at our new
Computation Center. Unfortunately, I may be away myself

~ during the month of July but I will be back August 1. How-
ever, many of the Computation Center staff will be around
in July and I am sure will be glad to show you the place
and let you do as much work as you care to. We are in the
' new Compton lLaboratories, not too far away from Professor
Slater's office, where I imagine you will have your main
headquarters. However, if you would like to gpend some
time at the Center, I am sure we can arrange space for you.

I do not know when you intend belng back at
Cavendish. I expect to attend a conflerence on operations
research at Oxford the week of September 2, If you are
back home the previous week I might arrange to fly over
earliér and spend, say, Friday and Saturday, August 30 and
31, visiting you there. We can probably make detalled plans
in August when I get back, if you are still here then. How-
ever, if you do not expect to be back home by the end of
August I would appreclate your letting me know 8o that I
can make other plans.

 

Yours,

Philip M, Morse
