On Apru 23 yon vrota me reearaiu some ehnngos in |
the mce allotted to IBM in Puilding 20 and in the Compu~
tation Center. I have discussed the questions which you
raised with Professor Morse and Mr, MacKinnon. Our con-

‘clusion is that we cannot provide classroom space as Oute
. 1ined in your sacond choice, because of severe crowding
' during certain periods in the regular acedemic year. There-
~‘fore, you should plan to continue to use the space aonlgnod

to you 1n Bnuding 200.

" Professor Morse hu also agreod that you conld use
Room 24-145 in the Computation Center and maske the nhifts
in your presont space that you outlined,

Yery sincerely yours
