4. Free dimenSion. . Now if our set of ("if“) took on all integral n-tuples

(except the origin), a dimenSion would be deﬁned for these d| [#001. Its value 'll

[First of all the deﬁnition of free dimension would not change if the (m ()0)
took on all real values (except the origin)_ To see this, we must ask if the rank

By homogeneity this depends on the n — 1 ratios of the n components of each
(35,00) (1' = 1, 2, . . . , n); but certainly any such ratios can be approximated
arbitrarily closely by ratios from n components of integral lattice points. This
is a simple consequence of the Dirichlet boxing-in principle. Hence this same
q X g minor will be non-vanishing for an integral set of (rnjm),

Thus in determining the free dimension from system (3.4) we may regard
R,,“) as a function of the free variables x“) no longer subjected to membership
in a lattice. The coeﬂicients A“), for instance, can be taken as polynomials in
x,” when o is a rational function, by virtue of the fact that a polynomial in
several variables vanishes for all values of the variables only when it vanishes
identically. The free dimension will be denoted by Q.

Our only general information about ¢ is that it is homogeneous; hence in
formula (2.2) one of the variables a” can be cancelled out, making Fdependent
on only n2 — l of them. In a corresponding way, from formula (3.4),

From the theory of implicit functions it follows that the free dimension is

the minimum number of variables, on which the various F“) really depend as
