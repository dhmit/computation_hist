The Needs - As a matter of fact, the finencial and organiza-
tional requirements to provide machine facilities for train-
ing and educational research, which are the subJject of this
report, are not very large, compared to the budgets of several
existing projects concerned with computing equipment.

The needs of the Institute for computing facilities
are, of course, manifold. Projects have been formed, and
others probably will be formed, to design and construct
special computing equipment, as part of our contribution
toward the general task of the mechanigation of industrial
operations. Other DIC projects use, and will use, computing
equipment as tools to help them carry out their project
assignment. This report has nothing to suggest concerming
these project machines and their use, beyond pointing out
that it is unrealistic to expect them also to satisfy our
educational needs. Such projects arise when an "industrial
requirement" arises and when someone in the staff has great
enough interest and enthusiasm to get the requisite backing
and to organize the project. They are important for the
Institute as a whole, but they are only incidental to the
problem discussed in this report.

Until recently the computing machines used pri-
marily for imstructional purposes have been small ones,
bought with imdividual department budgets and maintained with
little cost. â€˜For example, The Aeronautics Department has

an electronic analogus machine for imstructional and re-
search purposes. |

This report is also not concerned with such equip-
ment. Departments will buy such equipmsnt as they need it
and will arrange for its maintenance. Arrangements for the
use of the equipment by other departments can be made quite
informally. | |

WVhere the problem arises is in providing the larger
pieces of equipment, such az the IBM machines and the large
digital electronic machines. For the next ten years, at
least, such equipment will be too costly for a single de-
partment to carry on its budget, and will be capable of

serving a wider clientel than a single department. Assum-

ing that several hundred undergraduates are to be given
soms practical experience with such equipment, a battery of
