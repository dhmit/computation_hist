QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT
To: Users of Computation Center Facilities Date: December 22, 1958

From: Dr. F. M, Verzuh
Subject: Quarterly Progress Report for the Period October 1 - December 31, 1958

 

Each quarter the MIT Computation Center must report to its sponsors
on the use of the Center facilities, the nature of problems using the machines,
their progress towards solution and, after completion, the way in which the
results were employed. These data are also made available to all present and
future users by means of the Semi-Annual Reports emanating from the Center.

These reporis help to accelerate the development of improved techniques of
machine computation and to minimize duplication of effort.

To help us prepare our quarterly progress report, will you kindly
fill out the attached PROGRESS REPORT FORM and return it to:

Dr, Frank M. Verzuh
MIT Computation Center
Room 26-142

on or before Friday, January 2, 1959,

If your problem has been completed during the past quarter, and you
will not need further machine time, please:

1. Write a summary to accompany the enclosed Report Fora {sections
D and E of page 3). This should be in appropriate form for
direct inclusion in our Semi-Annual Report.

 

2, Send us two copies of publications based on the work done, and
