The title Geometrie der Zahlen was introduced by Minkowski over
half a century ago. Its subject matter has naturally expanded
greatly, particularly in the last twenty years, and the author com-
mendably presents a more modern account of the subject. The aim of
the Enzyklopddie is “to find a middle road between the . . . historical
presentation and the ... systematic presentation.” The reviewer’s
impression is that the work tends to be more systematic than his-
torical, but the few isolated remarks that follow can in no way detract
from the debt owed to the author for his pioneering compilation.

One major pre-Minkowskian development is the study of the min-
ima of quadratic forms in # variables, elegantly interpreted as the
densest lattice packing of equal spheres in # dimensions. The dis-
covery, essentially, that the symmetric tetrahedral packing (with
n-+1 mutually tangent spheres) is no longer densest when 7 =4 is one
of the earliest indications that #-dimensional “Euclidean geometry”
would depend on 7 with “number-theoretic” irregularity. Strangely
enough, the footnote reference to this result (footnote 184a) does
not refer to its discovery (by Korkine and Zolatareff in 1872) but
