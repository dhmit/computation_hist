Dear Professor Martin:

In acceordance with the request received from
Professor Morse, the following calculating machines have

been transferred to Room 2«263 for student use in connecs
tion with Subject M411,

These machines were purchased by the Center of Analysis for
use in the desk~calculator section. More recently, these
machines have been used jolintly by the staff of the Numerical
Analysls Laboratory and by students in the former numerical
analysis subjects 6,531 - 6,534,

It is evident from the above purchase dates that
the machines are not new and have seen considerable use., I
have therefore recommended that the existing service con-
tracts on the Marchant calculators be maintained in order
that reliapble service will be availatle during the forth=-
coming period of heavy student use, Accordingly, 1 have
submitted § invoices ($30 per year per machine) to
Miss Goodwin for payment,

Neither the Monroce or the National Cash Register
machines have been on a service contract, and repairs are
therefore obtained by calling the respective agency.
