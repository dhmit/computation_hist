about the exchange of visits between Computing Centre of the
Academy of Sciences and Carnegie Teche

In my letter I expressed my gratitude and asked you for a

Excuse me, please, for my remembering but I would wish to
know your decision as soon as possible because I have to coordinate
this visit with some other trips. Don't hesitate to inform me if
you have some difficulties concerning the realization of your
intention,
