Sample preparation requires some care for satisfactory
results. The lead cube used was cut and machined from a
bar of melting-point lead supplied by the National Bureau of
Standards (sample No. 49C). The thermocouple holes were
drilled at very low speed and pressure with continuous re-
moval of chips. Al:O; BeO,* and MgO were slip cast from
suspensions of finely ground material (see Part III, p. 76).
Thermocouple holes were formed by casting around stainless
steel rods 0.022 in. in diameter. After an initial set was ob-
tained the metal rods were removed. Oxide materials were
fired to zero apparent porosity. Bulk densities of oxides em-
ployed were 2.86 gm. per cc. for BeO, 3.48 for MgO, and 3.79
for Al,Oj. Samples of other ceramic materials have also
been prepared by this method, and other materials have been
prepared by machining and drilling thermocouple holes.

The determination of thermal conductivity requires the as-
sembly of istundards and samples and the adjustment of
heaters te give satisfactory heat flow and temperature distri-
bution. Samples with wedged thermocouples and heaters
are assembled and aligned, and pressure is applied to hold
them in place with the outer guard cylinder in the upper posi-
tion. Then the guard cylinder is lowered and the temperature
of the furnace raised to about 900°C. to promote the plastic
flow and adhesion of the silver foil. The heater windings H,
H,, and l.l.-, are then set to give the approximate tcmperatur(:
l(-\"cl desired. Suhsw;u?nl]\', the guard heaters H,—H; are
adjusted separately to give the same temperature gradient in
the guard cylindgr as occurs in the samples. These heaters
are adjusted until the thermocouples in the guard cylinder,

the specimen assembly (= 1°C.). Initially, this trial-and-
error behavior was quite difficult, but after some experience
with the assembly the guard-cylinder temperature can be ad-
justed quite readily.

From measurements of both standard samples the thermal
conductivity of the unknown control specimen is calculated by
equations (1) and (2). Calculations with the two standards
agreed within +=59;. Dense Al,O;, the conductivity of which
has. been determined by absolute methods (see Part 111, this
591.'1@5)' above 550° C. was used as a primary standard. Below
this temperature the conductivity of alumina was successively
determined from a standard at a higher temperature. The
lo.w temperature values of Al,O; were checked by comparison
w1th. melting-point lead. The standards sh()u'ld have con-
ductivity of the same order of magnitude as the test specimen
for best results. Typical data obtained using Al,O; standards
are shown in Table I. | -

gators have employed, but remains small enough so that
samples of ceramic materials can be formed or obtained with
relative ease. The increased size makes a suitable heat distri-
bution in the guard cylinder easier to obtain, makes assembly
more precise, makes temperature uniformity better, and de-
creases the effect of small errors in measurements of sample
dimensions.

Temperature measurement directly in the ceramic sample
eliminates the errors and assumptions connected with inter-
facial thermal resistance. This type of error can be found
in most equipment described in the literature. The addi-
tional difficulty of forming specimens with thermocouple
holes is well repaid by the increase in accuracy and reliability
obtained. The interfacial temperature drop is still impor-
tant, since a large drop at the interface makes perfect guard-
ing almost impossible.

Controlling the temperature of the guard cylinder to match
that of the samples within £1°C. by five separate heaters in-
sures that the lateral heat flow is less than 1 or 207 at most.
Here again the extra effort required for setting up and balanc-
ing the temperature equilibrium seems 1o be worth while.
Some estimate of the accuracy and precision obtained is evi-
denced by calculations from two separate standard samples.
The maximum difference which the authors have ever found
in values calculated from the two separate standards is 7%.
The normal variation observed is less than 3%.

The values shown for melting-point lead in Fig. 6 are from
2.7 to 3.29, greater than those reported by Van Dusen and
Shelton.? Values found by Scholes* are somewhat lower than
the values found in this ix‘l\"cstigulinn. A value reported by
Weeks and Seiferts is in close agreement with the present
values and with those of Van Dusen and Shelton.?

The values found for dense Al.Ojs are appreciably 1}i.gher_
than those of all other investigators except Weeks and Seifert.”
The present value is about 3% higher than their value at
95°C. Values reported by Knapp,’ Fitzsimmons,® Rysch-
kewitsch,” Taeger et al.® and Eucken? are lower than the pres-
ent values. In each of these cases there are serious doubts
as to the accuracies of their methods, parliculurly at the lower
temperatures where thermal conductivity of Al:Og 18 high and

interfacial resistances become of more importance. A similar
result is found for MgO and BeO.

The low values previously found for these materials can in
large measure be attributed to the assumption of negligible
interfacial resistance in most previous work. The thermal
conductivity of Al;03 and MgO at room temperature is of the
same order of magnitude as the many conductors among
metals. Previous investigators employing a comparative
method3+4 have assumed that interfacial resistance is negli-
gible. This is probably a satisfactory assumption for most
work with low-conductivity materials, e.g., glasses and com-
mercial multiphase brick. It is not satisfactory for high-
conductivity materials such as pure Al:Os;, MgO, and BeO.
Similarly, in developing relations for diffusivity or unsteady-
state methods, investigators have assumed that the inter-
facial resistance is negligible in most cases.®® This is prob-
ably satisfactory for low-conductivity materials, but not for
Al,Os;, BeO, and MgO. The variation between previous
values of conductivity is directly related to the values found.
Fitzsimmons' results® are 239% low for Al,O; at k= 0.030, 149,
low for Al.O; at £ = 0.020, and in quite good agreement with
results found by another method for ZrO, at B = 0.005.
Similarly, but on a much less precise level, Jaeger et al.® re-
ported values about 89, of the true value for BeO at & =

0.55, about 509, of the true value for Al:O; at £ = 0.07,
about 259, of the true value for MgO at £ = 0.08, and close
to the true value for ZrO, at & = 0.005.
