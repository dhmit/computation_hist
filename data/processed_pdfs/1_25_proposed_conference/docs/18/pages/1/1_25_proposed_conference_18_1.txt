GOVERNMENT RELATIONS PANEL
S. Gorn-Panel Chairman June 2, 1960

Problems concerning government relations to university computer activities will
vary with the variety of supporting agencies within the government, but will also
depend on the varieties of universities and their computer activities.
The variables to be considered in the government agencies are:
1. are their funds earmarked for production, development, basic research,
or education?
2. Are they supporting the computer activity directly, or only indirectly
as explicitly budgeted service for individual projects, or indirectly as
overhead to individual projects?
3. Is their support one-shop or continuing?, year by year or for a number
of years? Do they recognize that an initial capital support entails a
commitment to year-in-year-out operating expenses thenceforth? Is
provision made for the hidden overhead of obsolescence and replacement ?
It should be recognized that the very variety of supporting agencies or variety of
policies among divisions of the same agency can cause loss of support because
each can expect another to pick up the responsibility.
This is probably one of the main reasons for this conference.
The variables among universities are
1. state supported vs. privately endowed
2. generalized vs. specialized (e. g. to technology)
3. new in computers vs. already deeply involved;
In either case, how much need is there for analogue facilities and conversion facilities ?
4. owning vs. renting vs. building
5. small, medium, or large machines; contracted or local maintenance;
are trained operators required?
6. Computer activity centralized or decentralized? If decentralized, is it only
within the university or involving a number of universities?
7. If centralized, is it university-wide, under the mathematics department,
the physics department, statistics, business school, engineering, or under

the comptroller ?
