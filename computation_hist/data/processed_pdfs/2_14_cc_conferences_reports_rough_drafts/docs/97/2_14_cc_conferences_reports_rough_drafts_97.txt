Your Ref't Thr

Dear Dr. Kredell:
We would indeed appreclate receiving a visit from you
while you are in the States. If it is important that you talk

with me, Thursdays are somewhat easier for me to schedule such a

visit than other days in the week. In any case, it would be most

useful to hear from you just when you plan to visit M.I.T. s0

that we can make arrangements.

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse, Director
