June T, 1957

Memorandum to: Mr. J. Blackburn
Cambridge Office

Enclosed please find progfam entitled Data Processing Seminar for
University Professors - August 5th - August 9th, 1957 - Endicott.

We would like to have some one from M.I.T. give a talk the after-
noon of August 6th on the University Computing Curriculum. It is
felt that M,I.T. could most aptly contribute on this topic.

Please let us know the person you select to give the talk, and
advise him that it would be helpful that he provide a write up on
his talk, or an outline, providing 60 copies for distribution to
the audience, and providing a multilith master for later dis-
tribution of the proceedings.

We also enclose a copy of those professors who have enrolled for
the Seminar, U4 people, and those we expect to enroll, 27 people.

We would appreciate it if you would follow up on those names on
the list and others so that we are assured of a quality attendance,

as well as quantity participation.
