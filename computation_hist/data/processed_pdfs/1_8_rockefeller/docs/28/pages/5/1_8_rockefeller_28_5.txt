areas which we feel should be investigated, which are certain to
produce results of immediate interest and which, in addition,
should provide hints as to still more important applications.

A, One of these is the 4eopcr‘1nvestigation of machine
logic 1tsel£. A computer of the complexity of the 704 is too big
to be able to see immediately how 1t can "think." Host nachinea
are now programmcd to do ordinary arithmetic, a a few progrmma have
" been devised to make the maohine cbey the rules of Boolean logic
and some tgought has bcen spent on working out programs to make ftlre
maohine play chess or checkers, in other words to obey the logie
of a game. Different sciences and branches of learning have
their own kinds of thought processes. For example, economics
and genetics each have patterns of thought which do not exactly
duplicate those of physics. Fundamental research 1s needed to
work out programs, rules of thought for the machine, which correspond
more closely to these other patterns. With a machine of the
flexibility and storage capacity of the 704, such research 1is worth
while. It will have to be tackled, at the beginning, by teams of
experts in the field of interest, together with mathematical
logicians who know machine operation.

B. Another general line of attack 1s/£ﬁe field of the
storage and rapid access to information, such as 1is needed in the
problems of language translation and historical research, for
example. Several schemes of ctding of jnformation, sco that it can
be found quickly and e;sily, have been devised on paper, but the
"pugs" in such schemes will only become apparent when masses of

information, of the order of several hundred thousand items, are

to be ordered and sorted out. The new installation at the
