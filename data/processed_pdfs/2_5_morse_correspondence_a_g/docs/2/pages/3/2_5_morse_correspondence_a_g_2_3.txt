The Pregeat Houtine

4 post-mortem routine hes bown written at MIT for the IBM 704
computer. The main feature of this routine is that its output is in
the same language in which the progrusser codes. That is, it priats
or punches the contents of core aemory (and we plan (v extend this
soon to include tapes and drums also) in any of the various forms
sccepted as input by the Share Assswbly Prograa,

The roages to be printed and the forms in whichk they are to e
printed may be specified either mamually at the 704 comsole or by &
gymbolic request card. |

These sysholic reguest cards themselves lock Like four address
share symbolic iastructions. Whea referrving to core memory, the first
two addressos specify the initial and final addresses of a range o be
printed or punched. These addresses may be any oxpressions possi~
bly involving sysbols which the post-mortes routine mast translate
into absolute numbers using & syabol table read in slong with the
sysbolic reguest cards, (Such a eymbol table is produced by the as-
pembler when the program being checked out is ssseabdled.)

Toe third sddiress specifies in which of the following forms
the output will appenr:

1) Ingtructions with symbolic sddrvesses, (The ability
to obtain symbolie addresses ack ageain v regard as the most lmpor-
tant feature of this routine.)

2) Instructions with absolute addresses.

3) Decimel floating point sumbers.

4) Decimal fixed point numbers with scale factors.

ยง) Decimal integers.

@) Oectal iategers,

7) Binery coded decimal, i.9., charactors oun the IBN
Zeypanch weoyboard.

&) Binary casds.

i. %e probably will prepare a fow slides to iliusirate the symbolic
reguest cards and the priasting they produce,
