the partial sums. Thus the root of our power series must be transcen-
dental. By this method we can obtain some transcendental numbers

* which seem to have previously escaped notice.

2. Approximation of a fixed algebraic number by an arbitrary alge-
brai'c number. We let 8 be a fixed algebraic number of degree » whose

denominator is fo, that is, 8 satisfies the equation with integral co-

efficients 40" 4 60"+ - - - + £, = 0.

We consider « the root of an arbitrary polynomial with integral coeffi-

Denoting maxl f.-l by 4 [qS(x)], we shall measure the closeness of o
to 6 by the smallness of #(0) in terms of 4 [6(x) ].

Now setting ¢(x) =fox™+fitox™ '+ - - - +folg, we find ¢(0) can be
written as &(1,8) /£, where t,0 is an algebraic integer. Thus if we multi-
ply ¢(#) by its conjugates, we obtain

(2) [160) = {TI6wd) } /0 = M[s®)]/ta

where M[¢(0)] is an integer. If ¢(0)#0, then the same inequality
holds for the conjugates of # and thus

(3) | M[6(®)]] = 1.
For any conjugate of 6, we find easily
(4) |6 | = 4[e(»)]T7,

where 7 is a constant determined by 6.
Hence if ¢(0) #0, we obtain from (2), (3), and (4)

plicity set ao=1. Let o5(x) be the ith partial sum (up to and including
the exponent ex). Then of the coefficients a; in ox(x) let g be the
maximum |a.-| (gn21) and let dx be the least common multiple of
the denominators s;in oa(x). Then if as h—s oo, en+11s of a higher order
of infinity® than es, log gs, and log d,, we find that o(x) is transcen-
dental for all algebraic x within its circle of convergence, except x =0.
To see this, let x take the algebraic value 8 of degree n within a
circle of convergence of radius p. We suppose E(g) to be an arbitrary
polynomial of degree k with integral coefficients of which the greatest
has the absolute value 4 [E(¢)]. Then we wish to show E(a(0)) 0.
First we write E(o(x)) as partial sum and remainder

E(o(x)) = E(on(x)) + Ra(x).

Now ¢5(x) =dxE(ox(x)) is a polynomial of degree ke, with integral
coefficients. I'ts maximum coefficient 4 [¢p4(x) ] easily satisfies the con-
dition

Alpn()] < & X A[E@) |(h + 1),

an(k + DA[E@) |k + D)t

since any coefficient in the polynomial ¢, (x) is less than the value this
polynomial assumes when we replace each a; by g, and set x=1.

Furthermore, since E(¢) has only a limited number of roots,
E(g4(60)) can not vanish for all %. For, when & changes to h+1, o4(8)
changes by a0+, which approaches zero as & approaches infinity,
although this term never vanishes, =0 having been excluded. Thus
by (5), for an infinity of valuves of 4,

But since % can not exceed 2¢ (or even e;), we can simplify the last
inequality and obtain
