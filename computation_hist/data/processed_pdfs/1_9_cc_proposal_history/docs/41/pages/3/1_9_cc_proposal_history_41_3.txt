to departmental budgets. Also possibly special felliowships and
other grants could be obtained to help with F.

Space Problems - To house this equipment, staff and space for
classes, we would need 8,000 square feet working area, at least
twice as much space as our present IBM installation (item B) is
using. There are several possible ways of getting this space (no
order of preference is implied in the following 1ist)!

1. Take more space in Building 20. (Probably not possible.)

2. Build a new bullding to house it. (Not very expensive
constructlon, but would need air conditioning.) i

5. See 1f IBM could provide space for it in a possible new
building they are considering bullding in Cambridge for
thelr own sales crganization (not feagible unless the IBM
building were on or very close to the campus). The Barta
Building, now housing Whirlwind, would not be desirable
and, In addition, Whirlwind will be used by Lincoln Labs.
for several years after we rellinquish it.

Participation by other Universities - If MIT can give our sister
colleges in New England sSome benefits of the Computing Center, i1t
would be a little easier to explain why we got such preferential
treatment. Even without the desire of IBM for us to do so, 1t
probably would be good policy to extend an offer of help, even to
The extent of having a coordination cowmittee of representatives
from some of the other institutions. The cooperation would not
amount to much unless the other institution contributed actively,
which would mean in practice having at least one of their staff
at the center at least half the time. 1In fact, it wight be
appropriate to say that any institution which wishes to partici- |
pate actively should contribute directly to the support of budgets
E and F, elther by cash payments or contribution of personnel.

Possible Timing - IBM indicates that it will not have a 70% avail-
able for us until about January 1957. Until that time the present
arrangements gilven in items A and B can contilnue, these groups
getting their funds by charging the DIC projects. Since MIT is
already giving courses on machine use, IBM has offerad to give

us a 60 per cent educational discount on the machines in item B,
until the time when the TO4 will be sent to us. This will ease
the budget pressure on B. Item C will have to be discontinued on
June 1956, unless machine earnings have increased sufficiently for
some money to be avallable to hire graduate assistants..

In this transition period the two groups A and B are being
coordinated, 8o they can be combined into one group, when the new
equipment comes, with winimum loss of efficiency.

The main question requiring decision in the near future is
that of housing. The present plans and the donation of the equip-
ment by IBM cannet be implemented unless the 8,000 square feet of
working space is available for the proposed Computing Center by or
before January 1957.
