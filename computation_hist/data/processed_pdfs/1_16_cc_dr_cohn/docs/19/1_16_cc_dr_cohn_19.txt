of real numbers T are preserved under the transformations of the modulgy
group: a’ = (az 4- b)/ (cx + d), where @, b, ¢, d are Integers Satisfying the
relation ad — pe — 1. To cite 3 few of thege Properties, we might mention
the rationality of 4 ang the boundedness of the parti] quotients in the simple

in many problems in diophantine approximation. Some very

contmued fraction for 2.

Although any real function of the reg] variable gz, Imvariant under the
transformations of the modular group, is either constant or totally discon-
tinuous, there gre functions of 4 complex variahle T, analytic in the upper
half plane, ang Possessing the desired invariance, Aside from the constant
function, these So-called modular functions all have essntial singularities on
the real axis. Our problem is then that of investigating the influence of the
diophantine character of 4 real number z op the essential singularity of
certain modulgy functions at 4.

Hardy ang Littlewood [3], [4]: carried out such ap investigation for
the purpose of setting bounds op certain exponentig] Sums (given by the
Jacobi thetq functions on thejy boundary circle) by studying thege functions
near the singularity In question. Conversely, Wintner [7] analyzed the
behavior of the Dedekind 5-functiop by considering the coefficients in its
Power serjes expansion, Although we present a discussion of the singularities
of certain modular functions as related to the singularities of the terms of
the infinite series fépresenting them. our objectives will be primarily in the
realm of function theory, since we shall, for instance, demonstrate function-
theoreticg] properties in the large on the basis of the behavior of modular
functiong near singularities.

The Poincaré theta functions, having the period 1, can always be
expanded into a Laurent series in exp 2mz valid for Jz positive and larg.
In some cases the series is finite in one direction so that

f(2) = (exp— 2mirz) (Ko + ky exp 2miz + + « +),

where k’o 5 0 and 7 is an integer. (This occurs, for instance, when f(z) is
bounded as Jz— 0.) Then we say f(z) is of degree r. Thus if f(z) has
no poles the function P(w) introduced in equation (4) is a polynomial of
degree 7 + m,, where m, is given in the above table. For other function
theoretical aspects of theta functions, too numerous to recall here, we refer
to Poincaré’s papers. We are principally interested in the tables jus
presented.

where the asterisk means that a and » run independently over complete sets
of residues modulo ¢. We now assume once and for al] that 30 = 0: thus
we avoid poles. The series (5) with appropriate grouping of terms, or series
(52), converges absolutely and uniformly in the region ® mentioned above,

If we differentiate the series (5) term by term we obtain a series in
which the convergence is now absolute and uniform, without grouping of
terms, in the region ®. Thus we define

3. Non-vanishing of theta functions. We are now faced with the by
10 means trivial problem of deciding if our theta series vanish identically.
Without such a decision, the problem of asymptotic behavior may be
meaningless, |

The case of Fp (2) is easily disposed of. If z approaches infinity along
the imaginary axis, by the uniformity of convergence of its series, Fp (2)

see this, we need only estimate the Bessel functions occurring in (7) to show
that, when n=1F% =1, the second term in the expression for A, is much
less than 8, (=1). It is sufficient, for our purposes, to know that the
exponential sum in (7) is less than ¢. The tedious details of the estimations

The expression for (1,(z) in the equation (8c) is of some interest since
it is proportional to the square of J’(z)8J (2)(J (2) — 1)-3, which in turn
is proportional to the twenty-fourth power of (2), the Dedekind n-function.
To see the last statement, we combine the result [2], J(2) = Fy(2)%n(2) 2/1728
with the expansion for F(z) in equation (8a).

We see from the table in the last section that only Poincaré theta
functions of order 0, == 6,2 12,- - +, can be devoid of zeros and poles.
It is also clear that G,,(2)%* is such a function when k is an integer. Thus
the theta function f(z) has mo zeros or poles if and only if F(z) = Gy,(2)%
exp g(J(2z)), where g(w) 1s an entire function of w. Hence among functions
of finite degree, the only theta functions devoid of zeros and poles are G,(z)¥
times a constant.

6. Asymptotic behavior and term by term estimation. The function
Fun(z) = 3(cz + d)~*™, m = 2, has the advantage of permitting a term by
term analysis of its behavior at rational points. Specifically, let z approach
p/q in a Stolz neighborhood, or let z— p/q = ps + ip. where p, and p, are
real, p, > 0, | po/p1 | = A, (a parameter of slope of the Stolz neighborhood), \
and p,% + p.2— 0. We break up F,.(z) into two parts, one part F* con-
taining just those terms which become infinite at z = p/q, and another part
F®) consisting of the remaining terms.

Then FV) is the summation restricted to those terms where ¢/d =— ¢/p,
or FN) = (2 — p/q)*mRq*¢ (Rm). ;

It remains to estimate the terms where ¢/d == — q/p. Setting z2=p/q

Now the terms may be grouped as follows: Since (p,q) =1, cp + dg takes
ch non-zero integer n for a family of values (c,d) of the fom

¢ = Cp + pg, d = dn — pp, Where (Cn, d») is a special solution to cp + dg =
determined by the condition 0 = ca < ¢, and p takes on all integral values

We may now take our majorant as follows:

(92). | F®| = gq Sv 3 {[n + prg® (pn + cn/q)]?

n=-® p=-o

+ [p2g* (ne + cn/q) 1%},

where n50.

We consider the summation on n for pu fixed. The quantity 4, =n
+ p1¢*(n + ¢n/q) has the difference Anag— An =F + p1q(Cnk — cn), which
differs from k by less than 4, if p,¢* < 3, as we shall now suppose.

the sum

n=- p=—o

majorizes the sum in (9a) except for those terms of (9a) where, for
given pu, n takes on such a value as to make | 4,| < 3. But clearly, if

$0, [pig (rt cn/@)| > [n|—3 and pog*(n + ea/q) > | pe/po | (| n | —1).

Adding this contribution to S; we get

Now the first part of the right hand side of (9b), or §,, can be majorized
by an infinite integral if we observe that the summation on p is of the

We consider a theta function of finite or infinite degree, without poles,

and of order m. Under the change of variable 2’. = (p'2— q") /(— quz + pn),
where p'pn— ¢'qgn=1, We obtain: f(z) =f(2) (— qnz + Pn)" If :
approaches 6 In a Stolz neighborhood of slope less than A and if 4 has
hounded partial quotients, then (— quz + pa)? (2— 6) where z belongs
to pa/qs. This follows from inequality (12). From inequality (11) we see
that 7 lies within certain bounds making f(z") = 0(1), if z belongs to pu/qu.
Thus f(z) = 0(z— 6) for theta functions of order m and without poles.

If we know that f(z) has no zeros as well as no poles, we could write
f(z) x 1, in the above paragraph, whence f(z) x (z—0)™. Applying these
results to (,m (2), (theta functions without poles and of order 2m), we find:

(13) Gon (2) es O(z— 6)", m = 2,
and
(13a) G12(2) XX (2— 0),

where 6 is an irrational number with bounded partial quotients, and z— 10
in a Stolz neighborhood.

10. Characterization of a real number by the corresponding sing
larity. We shall see in the concluding paragraphs to what extent the
behaviors at real singularities determine the singularity and the function.
First we shall see that the behavior near irrationals with bounded partial
quotients is seldom better than a large O estimation.: In fact the estimation

(13) can not he improved to the type (13a) unless m = 6.

the examination of a number of special cases. It will be omitted as it
equires no new methods. What we do is let z approach # vertically and
show that if @ does not fall into one of the above categories, then the values
taken by the theta function must vary too widely to permit such an asymptotic

path of approach and in fact these paths of approach can even be made t,
lie in a Stolz neighborhood of preassigned arbitrarily small width. Wintne,
demonstrated this property for the Dedekind n-function,® Which has a well-
known expansion into powers of exp 2miz, and whose behavior as a function
can therefore be analyzed in the light of the behavior of the expansion
coefficients. :

At any rate it is now apparent that the diophantine nature of a singu-
larity of a theta function governs to a great extent the asymptotic behavior
at the singularity, and even the function itself.
