_ Dear | Norm: TEs

| If it is at all ootalble, the Computation Center
would like to make arrangements for the transfer of the
following equipment from Project Whirlwind to the
Computation Center, List of equipment follows:

=2 Flexowriters
2 Light guns

It also would be extremely helpful to us if we could

arrange to borrow a Ferranti photoelectric paper tape reader

for a pardon of some months until the one we have on order is
elivered.

Thank you for considering these requests.
