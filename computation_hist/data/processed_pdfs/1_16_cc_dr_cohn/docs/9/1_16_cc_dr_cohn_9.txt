APPROACH TO MARKOFF’S MINIMAL FORMS
THROUGH MODULAR FUNCTIONS

HARVEY CORN

The author considers J a sub-group of the modular group of genus one
corresponding to a fundamental “parallelogram" with rational vertices in tie
upper half—plane. Such a group J of linear transformations is actually deter-
mined to within similarity. If A and B are “generating” substitutions, (identi-
fying opposite sides), then ABA—13‘1 is equivalent to the substitution z’=z:;6
and the fixed-point of A, are roots of Markoff’s minimal forms. This can ae
shown by combining identities of Frobenius, (Uber die M arko/f Zahlm, Preuss.
Akad. Wiss. Sitzungsberichte, (1913). pp. 458487), with identities of Fric (e,
(Uber die Thean'e der automorphen M odulgmppm, Nach. Ges. Wiss. Gottingen,
(1896), pp. 91—101). This method can be modified to produce classes of forms
with a minimum close to one—sixth (rather than one-third) of the discriminant.

The matrices in 1’ taken by themselves are of some interest since every
denominator in the modular group must occur in the corresponding linear
fractional substitution. Sample generators of J are 2’ = (z + 1)/(z + 2),
z’ : (z i l)/(— 2 + 2), z’ = (32 — 1)/z, etc The fundamental domain can be
described in invariant fashion by the period parallelogram of the u-plane for

APPROACH TO MARKOFF'S MINIMAL FORMS
THROUGH MODULAR FUNCTIONS

BY HARVEY COHN‘

(Received March 26, 1954)

1. Introduction

In 1873), Markoll' [7, 31'") derived, by means of continued fractions, an infinite
sequence of integral indeﬁnite binary quadratic forms whose minima are greater
in absolute value than one-third the square root of the discriminant The method
of continued fractions provides probably the most direct, approach and was
used even more intens' '91)! as the subject of diophantine approximations de-
veloped [ti]. Neverthel a parallel development was started by Frobenius
[5, 2] in 1013, using properties of quadratic forms. In between, however, in
1896, Fricke [4] had considered groups of substitution matrices generating
fundamental domains of genus one in the upper half plane. In setting up group
generators Fricko had made use of identities of the type:

(1.1) emf + 9(3)" + @113)? = amameoun + aim/WIS") + 2

 

and
(1.2) 5(3113) + QM) = E(B)E(.rl1f),

where A and B are real unimodular matrices and E is the trace. The veriﬁcw
tion of these identities is straightforward, (compare [1, pp. 472, ~:lSIJ), yet the
close resemblance of these identities with Markot'l"s equation and its recursion
formula, (equations (5.5) and (5.3 bis) below), seems to have somehow escaped
notice.

In this treatment, we give a new derivation of Markol'l"s minimal forms, char-
acterized by arithmetic restrictions on Frieke’s problem,

2. Fundamental Domain

We start with a fundamental domain of genus one in the esplane belonging to
some group 3 with a speciﬁc representation in real unimodular linear substitu-
tion matrices, denoted as follows:

6. Change of generators

To gain more information about the representation of S, we select the simplest
possible generators. It is more convenient at times to use a triple of generators,

We consider the general generating matrix A for this group and the corre-

sponding form <l>i(z, y). From Part II it follows that a matrix exists of trace
equal to three times any Markoi‘f number, a, (see §5), and With lower left—hand
element a“ = ©(A)/G = a/2, (compare equation (6.3)). Once we shall have
shown that the (nonzero) minimum of My l is ©(A)/6, we shall have forms
analogous to Markoff’s forms.

11. Closure

Despite the fact that the matrices have fractional elements, we should still
want the forms tI>A(2:, y) to be ultimately restricted to integral a; and y so that the
“minimum” may have its usual meaning. To begin with, however, we must let
(x, y) vary over a larger set, namely the lattice .82 consisting of all couples (1, y)
for which rc + y and x — y are integers.

Consider the following parity-property of a matrix A : rl‘he property is that the
rows on addition and subtraction yield integers of like parity, i.e., an + 1121 and
an + an are (integers) of" like parity while a.“ — a” and an —— as; are also (in-
tegers) 0f like parity, (although the parities of these sums and differences will
not all necessarily agree). Now obviously Am, B“), C”), and E have this PTOP'

aha-sixth the square root of the discriminant 4(9a2 — 4). (Here a is an arbitrary
Markoff number). Unfortunately, the gap between “one-third” and “one—sixth”

is so vast, (see [6]), that the ”one-sixth” property does not characterize these
forms at all.

Some of the new (doubled) forms are listed below. One of the fixed~points is
exPanded into a simple continued fraction of which the purely periodic part is
shown. (The forms corresponding to the generating matrix are not necessarily

reduced).
