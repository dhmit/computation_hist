four to 81X positions would be open.

Forrester said he hat been asked by Dr. Smith of OER whether
the Aaaociation for Computing Machines could have its spring (or summer)
meeting here. The Committee felt that this would be appropriate and
asked Adams to find out whether the last half of June or the firat
half of September would be preferred. When this is aatermined, an
official invitation can be issued and plans begun.

There W&S a further discussion of the E. E. courses in
machine computation for seniors and first-year graduats students. The
Committee felt it was important that the one-term survey course, dis—
cussed at the last meeting, ho given this coming term. It also felt
that a one-term courae in punchacard techniques, at B level, should
be started next fall if possible.
