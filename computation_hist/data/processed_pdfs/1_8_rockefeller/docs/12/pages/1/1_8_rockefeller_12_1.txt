Dear» Dr} :luehsnen.’

as you suggested in our talk or November 9, l have been keeping
an ear.cpen'tor'examples or the social science problems in which_our
‘ . Computation Center is interested. As you knon,‘thm potential or such
f problems is largely unknown so that most examples must be or past
computer applications. One example though or research activity which
otters the promise o:.good team-work between a computation Center
staff member and social scientist is the following. -

 

, Professors Theodore Beer and Ithiel Pool or the M.I;T. Center
for International Studies have approached us on the teasibility of
"Computing Optimal Electoral Redistricting in Massachusetts“. This s

'a problem or immediate interest in the local political situation bu 5
I is also a type of problem of long-range national significance. Pro-
fessors Beer and Pool have thought through the problem to the point or_
developing various criteria of goodness (e.g. closely or evenly
distributed political strength in each electoral district, homogeneity
of socio-economic factors, etc.). In my Judgement, their ideas are
now ”ripe" for close liason with a computation specialist so that the
difficult task of quantifying their concepts and solving their problem
can begin. The method or solution will probably be by the techniques

of "linear programming“ which are very powerful on optimization probe
lows of this kind.

I should say that the above problem was essentially brought to us,
a procedure which in general puts the burden of computer knowledge on
the social scientist. It is very likely that there are many problems
of similar interest waiting to be discovered by computation experts

consulting with social scientists. I need say no more since this was
the gist of Professor Horse's proposal.

In addition, I have talked with Protessor Orcutt or the Economics
Department at Harvard. Professor Orcutt, who is also the Harvard
Representative of our Computation Center, wagigﬁngasgoggh to survey

into two classes, those involving standard mathematical manipulations
and those which utilize the computer for simulating or behavior studies
of economic systems. A brief list of these activities is:
