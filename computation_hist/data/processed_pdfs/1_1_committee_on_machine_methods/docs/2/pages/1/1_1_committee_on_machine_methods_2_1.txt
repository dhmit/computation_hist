Minutes of Meeting of Committee

Machine Methods of Computation

November 29, 1950

P. M. Morse and E. heisSner

Professors Kopal and Forrester presented the Committee
with the general subjects which are included in the Electrical
Engineering general doctor's examination. They come under
nine general headings:

Circuit Theory

Power Machinery
Magnetic Circuits
Engineering Electronics
VT Circuits

Electrical Measurements
Transmission Lines
Basic Physics I

Basic Physics I1

After considerable discussion the Committee felt that probably
a men taking a doctor's degree in the E. E. Department, with
specialization in computing macnines, should be required to
pass an examination in the majority of these subJects, but
that perhaps one-third of them could be dropped and in their
place more material on Mathematics and Theoretical Physics
could be required. It was suggested tentatively that power
machinery and electrical measurements might be dropped, and
that in their place questions could be asked on differential
equations, complex variables, algebra and numerical analysis,
corresponding to about the length and depth of the questions
on the two omitted subjects. In addition, it wss felt that
Basic Physics II could be somewhat remodeled to include more
of Theoretical Physics, particularly of electromagnetic theory
than is given to most of the E. E. candidates. It was felt
that the Committee should discuss this with Professor Brown

at its next meeting, if Professor Brown were able to attend.

The Committee then went on to discuss the four E. E.
doctor's candidates who have already taken their qualifying
examinations and are beginning, or are about to begin, their
thesis research. It was reported thet Mr. Salzer already has
a supervisory committee consisting of Professors Kopal, ﬁezen
and Linviilh. This was felt to be an appropriate committee
and there was no suggestion to make any change here. In the
