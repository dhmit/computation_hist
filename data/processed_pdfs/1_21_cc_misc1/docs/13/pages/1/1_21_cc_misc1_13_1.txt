Dear Dean Mann:

Since Professor Morse could not immediately suggest a
e to fill your position as Director of the Laboratory and
d of the Computer Science Program, he has asked me to see
1T 1 could do anything to help. The only immediate action 1
could take would be to turn your request over the the M.I.T.
ae Placement Office, but I fear the response might be over-
lming and the respondence not generally of the caliber you
{re. For those reasons I hesitate to do this unless you feel
it is desireable. The only other thing I can and will do is to
e your request known to certain other members of the faculty
the hopes that they may be able to suggest a name, I feel
should mention that there have been at least four similar
gwquests that have come to my attention in the past month.
There seems to be something of a run on computer center direc-

8'
y 1f you wish me to submit this request to the M.I.T.
lumnae Placement Office or if you can think of some other
way we may be of help please let me know.

Yours truly,

J. R. Steinber
