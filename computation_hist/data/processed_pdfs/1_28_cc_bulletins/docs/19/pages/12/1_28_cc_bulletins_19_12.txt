This would cause the untitled post-mortem deck to be associated with the

decks, SAP M100-5-1*%00 and SAP M100-5-1%02, and PMD M100-5-1%*01 to be

Logging During Translation Time

The translation phase will record all direction cards which it
encounters on the following devices:
(1) The on-line printer - this gives the computer operator
a step-by-step record of the run in real time,
(2) The PRINTER OUTPUT TAPE - this allows the user to infer
the sequence of BCD output obtained during translation time,
The user may suppress the logging of a particular direction
card on the PRINTER OUTPUT TAPE by punching any non-blank Hollerith charac-

ter somewhere in its location field,
