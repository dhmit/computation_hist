MODULAR FUNCTIONS DEFINED BY
PERTURBATION MAPPINGS*

HARVEY COHN

1. Introduction. There seem to be at least two different methods
of defining invariants (z) for Fuchsian groups, such as the modular
group, given by the transformations

(1) z—z = (az+b)/(cz+d), ad—bc=1,

where a, b, c¢, d are integers. The function I(2) is to satisfy the con-
dition

(2) I(z") = I(z) for Imz > 0.

The first method is to define the so-called Eisenstein series,
formed with terms arising from the denominators of the transforma-

tions, such as
3) Enz) = Yon (pz +)"

summed (once) over each reduced fraction p/q (positive, negative,
0/1, and 1/0). It is easily seen that for even m = 4 the series con-
verges absolutely to a sum not identically zero and, from the con-

vergence,
4) Enz") = (cz + d)"En(2).

To form a genuine invariant (with property (2)), we take a combina-
tion [3] such as

(5) Jz) = BE (@)/IE() — Es'(2)],

giving J(z), the well-known invariant. It turns out that all in-
variants are single-valued functions of J (2).

The second method, due to Dedekind [1], is to start out with the
fundamental domain, in the z-plane, and let 7(z) be an actual mapping
function that identifies the portions of the boundary that correspond

tion of a specific “perturbation circle”). Although the modular-

function methods are quite classical, critical use is made of the more
current idea of variation of the boundary.’

2. The perturbation map. We consider the perturbation caused
to the fundamental domain Dp by removing the portion above the line
Imz = 1/e(e < 1). The remaining (finite) portion, 9D. , is mapped
by the modular group z — 2" (of equation (1)) onto a portion of the
upper half z-plane, II, , which is constructed by removing from the
upper half z-plane the interior of a circle called C,/,(¢), tangent to the
real axis at p/q (31/0) and of diameter ¢/¢°. (For consistency, “the
interior of Cip(e)” denotes the region Imz > 1/¢). Thus II. is
a simply connected region of the z-plane, invariant under the modular
group. (See Fig. 1.)

We now define { = ¢.(2) to be the mapping of II. onto the upper

We define the perturbation function . , ([dS/dz > 0).

6) Plime imi — 2.
TT" e~0 €

The existence of such a limit is suggested by the next section which
indicates the connection with the Eisenstein series. The proof of its
existence requires the major portion of this paper.

3. Approximation by superposition. The series expansion P(z)
is derived first from the assumption that each perturbing circle is
approximately independent of the others. For instance, if just
(the interior of) one circle Cy/,(e) were deleted from the upper half
z-plane, the corresponding mapping function {‘*’?(z) (with fixed
direction element at 7) would easily be given by

(8) CP) == YN

The terms in ¢ are the “perturbation terms,” which (see equation
(7)) we should ‘superimpose’ to obtain formally:

("+ 1)(g + p2)
9 Pz) = oe le
2 BD = NET
or, reducing the general term, we should find
(10) P(e) = 2 — 52/2 — 2a 20104 P+"

Rather than justify the approximation directly (even on the
assumption that the limit (6) exists), we shall give what we hope is a
more revealing verification by deeper methods, more characteristic of
the theory of modular functions. In the meantime we observe, term

which is the promised connection between the perturbation map and

dicated Eisenstein series. :
i I Sings content with perturbation methods, we could obtain
E4(2) in terms of a fifth derivative (where the perturbation circle has
Tooter ¢/q etc.). But since the perturbed upper half plane

would not be invariant under the modular group, modular functions
would be inapplicable.

4, Approximate fundamental : domain. The preceding series
expansions, in addition to requiring a majorant argument, are
dependent on the special nature of the perturbation. The expansion
(10) will therefore be proved by a more general method. Since the
arguments are profuse and classical, it is hoped that a minimum of
detail will prove satisfactory.

Returning to the perturbation map of § 2, we note that since the
transformation z — 2" must map the upper half {-plane onto itself,

this mapping must be via what we shall call 7'(e), a linear fractional

transformation. In other words, referring to the symbols in equa-

tion (1),

12) = = (as + b/s + do), ade — bee = 1,
where, as ¢ — 0, it can be seen that

(13) <2 a — a, be — b, Ce — C, d.— d.

We shall differentiate equation (12) with respect to ¢ (at e = 0) and
obtain the transformations of P(z), as defined in equation (6), under

the modular group. (See § 7.)

6. Order of magnitude. From the value of n in equation (16)
it follows that for z in D,
(17) y= z+ 0(n).

Using the power-series expansion of the logarithm, we find that ¢ is
approximated by { + 0(q¢*). Thus equation (17) leads to

(18) ¢ + Ont) = z + O(n),
and from this,
(19) © — 2)/¢ = 0th),

which is 0(z’) as € — 0.

Now from (19) the limit (6), defining P(z), must exist at least
for a subsequence of e. The uniqueness of the limit will follow,
later, from the fact that we are dealing with a regular function, P(2),
completely characterized by certain transformation equations (21%)
and (22%) (below), together with the estimate (from (19)),

(20) P(z) = 0(2))
as z — 1° In OH, .

7. Transformation equations. From the definition of ¢.(z) In
§ 2, it follows immediately that
(21) t(—1/2) = —1/t(2).
To obtain the linear transformation representing {«(z + 1), we note
that, in Figure 2, 2” = z + 1 must map the arc »'f’ onto wf. Thus
we find
Glet+1) —)B =P _ (2) = NE — F)

MODULAR FUNCTIONS 347
Next, using the values given in § 5 together with equations (6) and

(16), we obtain in a straightforward manner from the first-order
terms in 7:

(21%) P(—1/z) = P(z)/<,
(22%) Pz +1) = P(2) + 32" + 32 — 3.
More generally, by this technique we see that

where ¢(z) is a quadratic polynomial. (Here q(z)/(cz + Bilis er
sentially 32"“/a¢” at ¢ = 0.)

8. Final identification of the perturbation function. Here, armed
with equations (20), (21*), and (22*), we can establish the expansion
(10). Let the right-hand side of (10) be denoted by S(z). It can be
formally verified that S(z) satisfies properties (20), (21*), and (22%).
Thus, letting U(z) = P(z) — S(z), we find

(24) U(—-1/2) = U_x)/7*
(25) Uiz+1) = Uz)
(26) UR) = 0F°) as z— iw,

and, in addition, U(z) is regular when Im z > 0.
Now we assert that such a U(z) is identically zero. For since
the function ¢(z) = U(z)J'(z) is invariant under the modular group,
by conditions (24) and (25), it is a single-valued function of J(z).
Furthermore, by condition (26), ¢(z) is not ‘large enough” to be
anything but linear, i.e., ¢(z) = pJ(2) + 0, for constants p and o.
Finally, the constants p, ¢ both vanish since #(z) = 0 at z = 7 and
z = 1 + 44/3/2. This establishes the expansion (10) (which is,
however, most naturally derived by the heuristic method of § 3).
