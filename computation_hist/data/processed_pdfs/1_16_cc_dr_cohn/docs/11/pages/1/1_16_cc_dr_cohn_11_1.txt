THE DENSITY OF ABELIAN CUBIC FIELDS
HARVEY COHN!

In the following note we show that the abelian cubic fields are rare
in relation to all cubic fields over the rationals. This is no surprise
since an irreducible cubic equation generates an abelian field if and
only if the coefficients of the equation are subject to a certain restric-
tion (that the discriminant of the equation be a perfect square). To
express this rareness in analytic form we arrange the fields in order
of increasing field-discriminant and we define

N4 (x) =number of abelian cubic fields of (positive) discriminant
<x, and

N(x) =number of (abelian and non-abelian) cubic fields of dis-
criminant <x in absolute value.

Then we show by means of a “zeta-function discussion” that
(1) Na(x) ~ (11¢/18) x1/2, as x — o,

where ¢ is given in formula (8) below. This result complements un-
published results kindly communicated by Davenport, to the effect
that N(x) =0(x), and by Heilbronn, to the effect that N(x)>cax
(even with the restriction that the fields be totally real).

It can be shown by class-field theory [1]2 that abelian cubic fields
of discriminant f? are enumerated as follows: There is a single field
with f=9 or f=¢q, and there are for »=1 exactly 2’ fields with f
=¢go*--qyor f=9¢ - - - ¢, where the ¢; are distinct primes =1
(mod 6). (These fields are in fact subfields of the field of the fth roots
of unity.) Thus,

(2) Na(x) = U(«'%)/2 + U(x'/%/9) — 1/2
where
(3) U(y) = § u(n)

and #(n) is, in turn, described by the generating function:
