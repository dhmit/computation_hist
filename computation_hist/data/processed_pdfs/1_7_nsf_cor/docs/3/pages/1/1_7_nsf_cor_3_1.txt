PROPOSAL FOR EXTENSION 01" NS? GRANT No. NSFOE 40
M
to June 0 l 60

In recent discussions with NSF staff it was suggested

that it would be appropriate to request funds for the next
three years, instead of Just for next year. Since the
program outlined in the Original Proposal, dated April 1956
and the recent Request for Extension, dated March 1957, is
for a three-year period, it certainly is appropriate to

request support for all three years now, since this has been
suggested by NSF.
