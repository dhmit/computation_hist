Deer Hr. lackintosh:

In accordance with our telephone conversation on Monday. May 27,
I have prepared a list or the telephone numbers and equipment which [4111 be
required in we .2an HIT Commotion Center in the Rex-Ti '1‘. Compton Laboratory.
This list Audie-tea the room number. the desired phone extension, the new
or the indie-1:41:31, and n brie: description of the equipment required at each
site. I 1mm that the detailed min on the autumn: no not mute
an obese: on this list; however, 1 tool I can better dieouie this with the
telephone people rather than trying to out it in a letter.

A: I informed you, at the oresont time in ‘Cik. Office of statistical
Services we have a summer of telephones and extensions which are darned to
the semi-31 administration account. Boa-tine at your oouvmxitmce l mold
like to discus which of the telephones on the etteched 1131: might be almi—
laz-ly billed or absorbed. 0n the other hand, however, I want to emphasize
that a umber of the people lined in this om are at the [amount tile lo—
cated at the bra Building on the Ibis-luau Project and the telephone: which
these people are currently using era, 0: course, paid for by a non project
6345. Sole similar arrangement wlll be We to:- people in the Computation
Center who are doing print-11y research work. m: is, their telephones
will be paid for from one of the occmmts oovoring such resent-oh work.

Although it is not apparent from the attached listing, l mu expec-
ting to install a paging unit which will ellow the receptionist in the Gom—
putetlon Center to select and couplete ace—14:5 without manual intervention.

The type or unit I am referring to is mom (in telephone jargon) as circuit
W441 We have such a circuit in the Bette. Building at the present time.
In principgﬁ this circuit will allow completion of incoming calls upon audible
indication from the motioninet without need of a. switch board operator.
Specimuy, lines 4111 - 4115 and (a similar number ten higher) 4121 — 4135
are used in a particular manner to effect this automatic paging action.

min, l 1.“ l beet discuss this with the equipment installation people
rather ﬂan trying to explain it in detail in this letter.

I would very much appreciate hearing from you in case there are
any questions on this (I on sure there will be). In the newtime, I would
like you to expedite this order in order that telephone equipment my be in—
stalled as soon as possible.

Sincerely yours ,

F. M. Vermin
