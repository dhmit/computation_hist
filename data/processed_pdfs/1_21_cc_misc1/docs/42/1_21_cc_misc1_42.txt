Dear Professor Coleman:

Professor Morse has shown me your letter of February 3%
wherein you inquire of the summer &oding course for the 704,
Although the dates are not set definitely at this time, it is
quite probable the course will be held here at M.I.T. during the
last two weeks of August as it was in 1956 and 1957.

In addition, there will be a course given here at the
Center during the spring term under the direction of Dr. Verzuh.
Obviously this will only be most convenient to those in the
immediate area of Cambridge. If there is any desire to use 704
time during the spring vacation for the coding course which
might be given by the I.B.M. representatives, prior arrangements
should be mad√© with Dr. Verzuh who is in charge of machine operation.

As reference material on coding, I would recommend a book
entitled DIGITAL COMPUTER PROGRAMMING by D. D. McCracken, John
Wiley, 1957. In addition the notes which were prepared by the
staff here at the Center for the 1957 course entitled CODING FOR
THE M.I.T.-I.B.M. 704 COMPUTER are now on sale through the Technology
Press here at M.I.T. and locally at the Technology Store. Finally,
1f the coding course is to be limited to the use of FORTRAN, I
would like to point out that in addition to the usual brown-colored
reference manual, there 12 now a tomato-eolored programmer's primer.

I hope this has answered the questions in your letter;
and if I can be of any further assistance, please feel free to write.

Sincerely,

F. J. Corbatd
