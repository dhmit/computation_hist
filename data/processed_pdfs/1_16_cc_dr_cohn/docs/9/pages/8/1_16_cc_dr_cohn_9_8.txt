We consider the general generating matrix A for this group and the corre-

sponding form &,(z, y). From Part IT it follows t.}}at a ma’?rix exists of trace
equal to three times any Markoff number, a, (sefe §5), and with lower left-hand
element ay = ©(4)/6 = a/2, (compare equation (6.3)). Once we shall have
shown that the (non-zero) minimum of |®, | is &(4) /6, we shall have forms
analogous to Markoff’s forms.

11. Closure

Despite the fact that the matrices have fractional elements, we should still
want the forms ®,(z, y) to be ultimately restricted to integral x and y so that the
“minimum’” may have its usual meaning. To begin with, however, we must let
(z, y) vary over a larger set, namely the lattice £ consisting of all couples (z, )
for which x + y and x — y are inlegers.

Consider the following parity-property of a matrix A : The property is that the
rows on addition and subtraction yield integers of like parity, i.e., an + ax and
an + ax are (integers) of like parity while a;; — as; and a;, — ax are also (in-
tegers) of like parity, (although the parities of these sums and differences will
not all necessarily agree). Now obviously A", B, ¢V, and E have this prop-
erty. They furthermore form a basis of the matric algebra generated by Ci
OVEL the integers, (since the product and quotient of these four matrices in any
Ol‘de}' Is seen to be expressible as a linear integral combination of them). Thus, In
particular, any matrix of the group " has the parity property.

expanded into a simple continued fraction of which the purely periodic part is
shown. (The forms corresponding to the generating matrix are not necessarily
reduced).
