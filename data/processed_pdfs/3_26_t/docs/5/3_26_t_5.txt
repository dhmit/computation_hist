Dear Mr. Thurston:

This note is to thank you for the very expeditious way
in which the series of computer runs for my HARVARD BUSINESS
REVIEW article were handled during the last several weeks.
It was very helpful to Dick Bennett and me to get back the
sequence of short runs as promptly as we did so that it was
possible to make adjustments and to arrive at the desired
end result. We did succeed in getting the variety of
situations which we were after.

Sincerely,

JWF:KDB
