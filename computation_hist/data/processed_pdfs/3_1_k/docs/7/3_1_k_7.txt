Dearﬂr. Krumhansel:

I am sorry but» I will be unable to attend the 1958
Gordon Research Conference to which you invited me in your
letter or May 6.

I appreciate the opportunity which was offered and
hope to participate in a similar conference in the future.
Unfortunately, other matters prevent me from attending the
conference.

Singerely,
