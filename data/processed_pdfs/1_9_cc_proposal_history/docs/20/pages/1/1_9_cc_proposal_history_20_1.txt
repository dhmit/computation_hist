. I'm sorry to have missed you last week when I was 1n
Washington. I also missed Weyl, so I'll have to come down again
when both of you are there, to bring you up to date on computlng
machine developments here. Lef me know when a good time would be
for you and Weyl in the next two or three weeks and I'l1 come down.

Dear Tqm.

I enclose a press release which will give you some idea
of the support IBM will give to our computing program here. It
will mean that, starting about January 1957, we will not need to
depend on you to support the operation and service aspects of our
computation program here, nor will we need money from you to *
support our group of research assistants in this fleld. We can
turn Whirlwind over to Lincoln Lab., which can use it still, and
“ecome out with a faster and more up-to-date machine which can de-
vote fourteen hours a day to basic research and education.

What will not be supported by IBM will be a research
staff, to continue research in numerical analysis and programming
logic, who could at the same time help projects like Slater's and
the nuclear theory group to design their machine programs.

I believe we should ask you to help support this kind | J
of group, since this would be spending your money directly for . .
research, on a 704 machine, which will be used by many other
1aboratories, and would represent a much smaller budget than you
have allotted us in the past five years--you would be riding on
IBM's basic contribution, so to speak, whereas before, the other
projects here at Tech were riding on your support for Whirlwind,
as far as computing went.
