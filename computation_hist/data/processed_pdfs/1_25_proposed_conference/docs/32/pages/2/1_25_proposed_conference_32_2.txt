The first National Conference of University Computing Center
Directors will be held June 2, 3, and 4 at the Shoreland Hotel in Chicaga Illinois.
Arrangements for the Conference are being made by the Headquarters Office of the
American Mathematical Society under financial sponsorship of the National Science
Foundation. The following Committee is planning the program:

Philip Morse, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, (Chairman)
Walter Freiberger, Brown University (Secretary)
E. L. Buell, Worcester Polytechnic Institute

S. Gorn, University of Pennsylvania

T. A. Keenan, University of Rochester

W. B. Kehl, University of Pittsburgh

A. J. Perlis, Carnegie Institute of Technology
H. R. Rymer, Northwestern University

D. R. Shreve, Oklahoma State University

W. J. Viavant, University of Oklahoma

W. H. Wells, Georgia State College

A. W. Wymore, University of Arizona

The purpose of the Conference is to investigate problems peculiar to
University Computing Centers and publish a report embodying the findings. The follow-
ing five topics have been selected for the agenda.
1. Budget and administration: What are good and bad ways of financing centers?
What fraction of time can be ''sold" and what fraction should be free? v L‘LTo"\“"\k"‘-"\/X
2. Computer-oriented research: What are the areas, of real intellectual
challenge, for research in the use of machines? What are the opportunities for theses
in these fields; how are such theses to be supervised and how are degrees to be granted
on the basis of these theses? WX
3. Curriculum and instruction: What sort of courses should be offered? Should
courses on machine coding be given for credit or as short courses without credit or as
u\v}'}‘“ﬁ?arts of other appropriate courses? What advanced courses with real intellectual con-
tent, intimately involving computing machines, are being given and in what departments ?
4, Computing service to university departments: Who in the college should be
given ""free time''? What priority system can be set up in case of overdemand? How
,‘ .‘\m"\ does one distinguish between free and paying users? What are appropriate forms for
\/I‘QN interdepartmental supervisory committees to administer such a service program?
5. Government relations: How should work done under Government contracts
be charged? Would it be feasible to establish a uniform scale of charges for the various

AN machines and services throughout the country?
