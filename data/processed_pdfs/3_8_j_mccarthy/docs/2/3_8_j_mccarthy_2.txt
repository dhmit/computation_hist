Dear John:

I em very sorry to hear that you do not wish to
participate in Session VII entitled "Existing and Proposed
Application of Externsl Signal Devices’,

I agree with you there is no point in talking about

something when we have not actuelly created any real hard
work, This means we must get started soon!

Sincerely yours
