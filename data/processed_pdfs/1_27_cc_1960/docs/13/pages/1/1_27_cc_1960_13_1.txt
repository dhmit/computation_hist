The Linking Segment System, F. J. Corbato, J. McCarthy

In future operation of the Center a situation is con-
templated in which there are a variety of programming languages
in use including SCAT, FORTRAN, LISP and others which may be

developed for various purposes. Programmers may wish to use pr
) ad

   

together@‘routines have been written in one or more of these
languages. Routines will be stored on tape or disc files and
should be callable into arbitrary memory locations by loaders and
linkable to new routines through the symbolic names of programs,
data arrays and parameter values. In a time sharing mode of
operation it should be possible to remove from core memory a
routine that has been waiting too long for typewriter input and
bring it back later when it is needed; but possibly to a different
location, since its old place may be taken.

Of the presently available systems,SQUOZE and the FORTRAN
II BSS system come the closest to meeting the requirements. However,
their deficiencies will not be discussed here.

To improve the above situation a new program form has been
developed that is especially suitable as compiler output. Sub-
programs in this form are called Linking Segment Subprogram (ESS).
The principle innovations of LLS are:

1. Selective retention of symbolic information from

the source subprograﬂbut with the bulk of the text in relocatable

 

binary.
