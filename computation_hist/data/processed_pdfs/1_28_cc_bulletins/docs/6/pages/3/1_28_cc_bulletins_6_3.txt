Tape. Density

High-density will be the standard case for tapes
at the Center, It is expected that FMS users will be
able to set tapes 9, 10, 11 and 12 to low-~density
by means of an FMS control card and therefore need
to make no program changes. Non-FMS users may have
to insert set density instructions into their programs
in order to read their present tapes.
