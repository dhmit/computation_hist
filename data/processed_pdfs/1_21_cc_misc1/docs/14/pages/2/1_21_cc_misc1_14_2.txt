STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM

High speed computers have augmented man's ability to
handle numerical data ang to get numerical solutions
However,

 

to problems,
the ability to handle symbols and formulas and to get
symbolic solutions to problems is even more fundamental to sci-
entific research,

 

 

 

Relatively little work has been done to study
the possible uses of high speed computers for such symbolic work.

We are convinced that the present computers have suf-
ficiently complex logic and are sufficiently adaptable that they
will be efficient in symbolic work, even though they have not
been designed for this purpose. We propose

l. to explore the general problem of how a digital |
computer can be used for symbolic work,

2. to develop a machine language in which symbolic
work can be easily carried out,

3. to write a detailed "flow-diagram! adaptable to
any high speed machine for the carrying out of
one Iimportant class of problems,

L. to write a program according to this "flow—-diagram!’
for the IBM 704 and possibly |

5. to make some recommendations for new designs in

computing machines that would adapt them better
for symbolic work.

For the specific problem to be tackled we propose the

inding of analytic solutions to a wide class of ordinary dif-

ferential equations. This is a sufficiently broad problem so

that one would have to face and solve all the basic issues that

would confront us in doing symbolic work on the high speed com-

puters. On the other hand, we are convinced that this problem
