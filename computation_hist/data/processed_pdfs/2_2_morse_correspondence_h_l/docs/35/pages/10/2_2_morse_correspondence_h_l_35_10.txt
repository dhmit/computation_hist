APPENDIX III. TETRAGONAL DISTORTION
IN Cd-In ALLOYS

Betteridge®® added small amounts of Cd to In and
observed the change in lattice parameter. At 100°C,

B. GOODENOUGH AND A. L. LOEB

14.5 atomic percent of Cd was soluble in In. The axial
ratio decreased from ¢/a=1.068 for pure In to ¢/a=1.0
for 4.5 atomic percent Cd. At 20°C the solubility limit
of Cd was 4.5 atomic percent. Between pure In and the
solubility limit ¢/a decreased from 1.076 to 1.04.

Since the Cd atoms do not contribute to the square
covalent bonds, the addition of Cd to In adds vacancies
to the (dsp?) band. The tetragonal distortion, and
therefore the energy gap between the (dsp?) band and
the conduction band, is reduced. At 100°C and 4.5
atomic percent Cd enough covalent-band electrons have
sufficient energy to go into the conduction band so that
the covalent ordering is destroyed, and the lattice be-
comes cubic. At 20°C there are fewer covalent-band elec-
trons which are excited into the conduction band, and
the ¢/a ratio is higher, at all cadmium concentrations,
than it isat 100°C. At 4.5 percent Cd and 20°C the cova-
lent bonds are still strong enough to force the Cd out of
solution. The tetragonal symmetry is therefore pre-
served.

If the phase transition from tetragonal to cubic
symmetry occurs in 4.5 atomic percent Cd at 100°C, a
similar transition might be expected a few degrees
higher in pure In. The melting point of In is 156.4°C.%
Apparently the low melting point of In occurs below the
phase transition from tetragonal to cubic symmetry.
