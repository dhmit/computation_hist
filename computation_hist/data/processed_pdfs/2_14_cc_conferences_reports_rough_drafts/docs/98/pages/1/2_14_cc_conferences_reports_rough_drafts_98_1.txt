Gentlemen,

In the middle of April I am planning to pay a visit to
the United States for the purpose of visiting various
public institutions and private firms. As head of the
Numerical Analysis Department of Asea, one of the
leading heavy electrical engineering firm in Northern
Burope I should be very interested if it could be
possible to arrange a visit to MIT Computing Center

in order to discuss with you or your assistants questions
concerning numerical analysis and application of com-
puters in electrical engineering.

I should be very much obliged if you could let me know
about the possibilities of meeting youv as soon as
possible, since I wish to draw up the programme of
visits.

Yours truly

ALLMANNA SVENSKA ELEKTRISKA AKTIEBOLAGET
