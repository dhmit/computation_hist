PART I. PROGRAMMING NOTES

 

 

I. INTRODUCTION

The FORTRAN-FAP Lionitor for the 709 is an extension of the 709 FORTRAN
system and can do more than compile and assemble. It permits the

following operations:

1. FORTRAN compiling.

2 FAP (FORTRAN Assembly Program) assemnbling.

3. ELxecution of object programs.

4 Execution of programs in linksâ€”a procedure necessary
where the total program is too large to fit into storage
and a link is a section of it which does fit into

storage.

Input to the lonitor System consists not only of FORTRAN subprograms

but may include the following as well:

1 Monitor control cards.

2 FAP symbolic subprograms.

3. Object subprogramnm binary cards.
4

. Data cards.

The relative order of a series of different types of input (exclusive
of data cards) does not matter provided that each separate deck, whether
source program, object program, etc., is preceded by the appropriate

control cards.

The FORTRAN compiler proper may be considercd a subsection of the
Monitor. Under FORTRAN control, a single source subprogram may be
compiled. Nothing further, including execution, can be done. 1f
multiple-compilation of a series of FORTRAN source prograims is desired,

Monitor control 1s required.
