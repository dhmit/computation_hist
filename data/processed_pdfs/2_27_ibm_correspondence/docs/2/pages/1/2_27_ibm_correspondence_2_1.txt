Dear Dr. Johnson:

It is with a great deal of plnme that I enclose our check

~for the IBM Research Associate recenily appointed for the 1959-60
school year in connection with the M.1.T. Computation Center. A
detailed description of the appointment is attached.

The increasing use of the IBM 704 Gomputer at M.1. 'l‘ by
the New England colleges both as an educational device and a research
tool hae been very encouraging to IBM, and we are delighted that the
Univeregity of New Hampshire is having an active part in it as
