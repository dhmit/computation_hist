APPENDIX IV

MIHIL1O Hilbert Matrix of order 10, double~precision in sense of RS005.

These cards contain the segment of order ten of the Hilbert matrix, in the
form of RS00S5 double~precision numbers, correctly rounded to 18 octal digits.
They are designed to save the next guy the exereise in decimal-~to=octal con=-
version this writer undertook. Note that if the least~significant parts of
the matrix are sorted out for single-precision'work, the remaining numters

will be incorrectly rounded in s number of cases,
