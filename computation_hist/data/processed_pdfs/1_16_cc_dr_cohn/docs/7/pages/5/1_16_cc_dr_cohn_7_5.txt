series expansion of the logarithm, we find that ¢ is
O(5¢"). Thus equation (17) leads to

(18) ¢ + 0(nt*) = 2 + O(n),
and from this,
(19) & — 2)/¢ = 0(),

which is 0(z°) as ¢ — 0.

Now from (19) the limit (6), defining P(z), must exist at least
for a subsequence of e. The uniqueness of the limit will follow,
later, from the fact that we are dealing with a regular function, P(2),
completely characterized by certain transformation equations (21%)
and (22*) (below), together with the estimate (from (19)),

(20) P(z) = 0(2)

§ 2, it follows immediately that

To obtain the linear transformation representing {(z + 1), we note
that, in Figure 2, 2" = z + 1 must map the arc '8’ onto 8. Thus

MODULAR FUNCTIONS 347

Next, using th.e v.alues givc.an in §5 together with equations (6) and
(16), we obtain in a straightforward manner from the first-
terms in 7:

P(2)/7,
P(2) + 32" + 3z — 3.
More generally, by this technique we see that

(23) P (cz - d) s

where ¢(z) is a quadratic polynomial. (Here q(z)/(cz + D e
sentially 32"“/a¢€" at ¢ = 0.)

8. Final identification of the perturbation function. Here, armed
with equations (20), (21*), and (22*), we can establish the expansion
(10). Let the right-hand side of (10) be denoted by S(z). It can be
formally verified that S(z) satisfies properties (20), (21*), and (22%).
Thus, letting U(z) = P(z) — S(z), we find

(24) U(—1/2) = U(z)/7’
(25) Uz +1) = Ue)
(26) U(Z) = 0(23) as z— 1o,

and, in addition, U(z) is regular when Im z > 0.

Now we assert that such a U(z) is identically zero. For since
the function ¢(z) = U(z)J’(z) is invariant under the modular group,
by conditions (24) and (25), it is a single-valued function of J (2).
Furthermore, by condition (26), ¢(z) is not ‘large enough” to be
anything but linear, i.e., ¢(z) = pJ(2) + o, for constants p and o.
Finally, the constants p, ¢ both vanish since ¢(z) = 0 at z = ¢ and
z = 1 + 44/3/2. This establishes the expansion (10) (which is,
however, most naturally derived by the heuristic method of § 3).
