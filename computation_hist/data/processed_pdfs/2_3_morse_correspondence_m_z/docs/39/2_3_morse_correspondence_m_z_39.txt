Deer look:

This letter is to put in writing the polltion
or the computation Center on the m 650, now rented by
the em.“ of Statistical Services. Under the yreeent
"ground rules”, as outlined by Dr. sander several months
use and again by you three veeke ago, In do not no how
the Center cm take on the equiment. It would mean a
“double standard" operation. which would be dangerous to
our initial operation.

Perhaps, next spring, we can :e-exenine the
matter again. and see whether in the light or our experi—
ence, either we, or you, should change our "ground rules".
And we are keeping epoee for the 650 in the Center. in cane
the rules should be changed.

But at pro-ant I can only reiterate what I told
Dre. Shader and Hunter lent March, and you lent month,
that the Center cannot take the 650 under the present
rules laid down by IBM. You should discuss with Mr.
Quick, who is in charge of the Office of Statistical
Services, men it should be removed.

Sincerely ,

Philip 14. Horse
