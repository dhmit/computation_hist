A number of departments make use of high-speed, all-
electronic analog computers built by the Philbrick Research
Corporation. Mathematically speaking, these machines solve
sets of total differential equations, both linear and non-
iinear. Under certaln conditions of similitude, systems
governed by partial differential equations may often be handled,
but normally, time 1s the only independent variable. These
are avallable in the following three groups: Instrument Section
of the Aeronautical Department, Hydrodynamics Laboratory, and
the Acoustics Laboratory. The machines are all similar and,
in fact, the parts are interchangeable. Many components can

be added or borrowed from one machine to another in order to

 

solve more complicated equations. The discussion of the machine

in the Instrument Section illustrates its general use.

Instrument Section of the Aeronautical Department. The
machine is used to solve ordinary differential equations which
arise in connéction with instrumentation problems. At{ present,

7 integrators are avallable. The time constant of the integrators
1s 0.4 milli-seconds (.% with T = 0.0004 seconds) which permits
solutions to beflashedoalmost instantaneously on an oscilloscope.
For many problems, it is desired to find regions of stable oscll-
lations. Since the parameters of the problem may be varied merely
by turning some dials, it is clear that a large class of solutlons
may be investigated in a fairly short time. Furthermore, it takes

very little experience to operate the machine.

Additional units include a multiplier component to find
