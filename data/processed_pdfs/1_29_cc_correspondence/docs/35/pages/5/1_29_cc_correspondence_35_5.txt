C. SE9AP nssembly Program

SE9AP is a SAP-like assembly program which has been
extended to include the addifional instructions for the 709,
The sole operation it performs is to translate the users
symbolic machine-language program into bilnary card format.
Consequently the user who chooses to work with SEQAP will have
to supply title-1log programs, loaders, debugging programs and
usually will subwmit his runs forp on-line operation. This
clumsy procedure of running orograms can easily use two and
one-half minutes of computer time for a half-minute runs., This
estimate i1s based on the assumption of %0 seconds SeE=up, 30
seconds of on-1line card-reading time, 30 scconds operation, 30
seconds for a manual recording of the console lights, and 30
seconds termination -- in view of the present shortage of machine
time, the Center feels it should discourage this form of
operation. However, as a transition measure SE9AP or its equiv-
alent will be available at the Center,

D. Other Programming Systems
The above set of prrogranmming systems are the G jor
ones in general use. In addition, there are several other
Systems in use at the Center such as DYNAMO, LISP, COMIT, SHADOW ,
and MAC. Each system should be converted to the 709 by those
who presently maintain it so that they will have continuity with

their present operation.
