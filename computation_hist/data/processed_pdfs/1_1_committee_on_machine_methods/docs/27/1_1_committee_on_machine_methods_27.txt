The actiO" zn applications for next yéar“s assistant—
Ehipa was reviewsd. Morse reported that Ruth Seiwatz and R. D.
Haun had turned down offers" The Committee approved appointing
John D‘ Little. (Since the Committee Meeting, loo Sartori has
been awarded a National Science Foundation fellowship for next
year and is consequently ralinquishing his half—time assistant—
ship.) Lin reportea that H. Giant: haé accepted , which com—
pleted the Mathematics recommendations fur next year for the
present. The appointlents made and accepted for next year
are consequently: mioal Engineering — J. F. O'Donnell;
Mathematics ~ N. J. licks, P. Fox, A. Balaton, H. Glantz,
R. L. Martino, and D" G. Aronson; Physics — S. In Rubinow,
F. J. Corbato, M. C” :owstoin, A. Tannin, A0 Duran; M. Reten—
berg, J. L: Uretskyﬁ L. Cambolio, and J. D. Little.

 

   

  

Three temporary appointments for the summer were
discussed nnd approved. Professor Henry Wallman, now in Sweden,
wishes to return to M.I.T. for three months this summer for work
partly with the Electrical Engineering Department and partly with
the Mathematics Department” It was suggested and approved by the
Committee that the Noonino ”rojoot contribute toward his salary
for the summe? and vo_uest fessor Mailman to work with tho
project for part of his tins hers, thus giving the project the
benefit of his sxpsria as i this fioido The two other appoint~
ments worn concerned with 1 Zoom bstwson the W? rlwiné group
and workers in other maohin projects“ elor has

Professors Reissner and Lin were requested to carry this opinion
back to the Mathematics Department and to suggest that the Mathe—
matics Department discuss such a course to be given by Professor
Hildebrand next fall. ‘

There was also discussion concerning a second term
continuation of this proposed course. Professor Hildebrand had
not gotten far along in his planning and was not at all sure that
he would be ready tc '*e a second term next year. After some
discussion with the Committee, however, he outlined a tentative
catalogue description for a possible second—term course, “Numerical
Analysis II“, This also is appendede It was suggested and agreed
that further discussion concerning this second—term course should
take place before any final action is taken; for example, it is
not clear how this suggested second term may overlap a possible
second—term course suggested by Dr. Grosch of the Whirlwind Pro-
Ject.

 

Caldwell pointed out that the Kopal project at present
being run by Dr. Jacchia has a number of items owned by the
Center of Analysis, among them being a number of desk computing
machines. He suggested that these be checked over before the
Jacchia project moved to Harvard and that these machines might be
made available for whatever laboratory course was to go along with
the course in Humer‘ 1 Analysis. Mr. Frank Verzuh, subsequent to
this meeting, sent cw r the inventory with Jacchia, and has supplied
Morse with a list 0: the machines available. (1 Monroe, 8 Merchants,
and 1_National Cash I ister Differencing Machine). Verzuh has been
asked to take care ' his equipment for the time being until a
decision on the lab re cry ”1 come to. There is also a library of
tables and texts on =tmputing which will be held for future disposi-
tion.

  
 

   

 

 

The next resting is to be held on April 16, at 3 p.m.
Further discussion Oi future courses in this field, and a possible
discussion of problems in Geophysics or Metallurgy may he on the
agenda.
