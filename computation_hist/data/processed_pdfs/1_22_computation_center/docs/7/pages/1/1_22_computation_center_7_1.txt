Dear Phil:

Thank you for your recommendation of January 4 in
regard to the papers by Clendenin and Harmouth.

The way 1 seeé it, we do wish to devote Some of the
pages of our Journal to methods of numerical analysis
and to methods of machine computation. Tt Is of
course difficult to say just how far we should go

sn this field, My own feeling is that we should

not concern ourselves with things which pertain to
specific machines, but should concern ourselves

with mathematics which might be called applied
mathematics as it pertains to the machine field in
general., How do you feel in this regard?

 

 

Sincerely yours,

ER: jt
