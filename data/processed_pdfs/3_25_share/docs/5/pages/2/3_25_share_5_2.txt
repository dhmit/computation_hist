Mr, Fletcher Jones -2 February 3, 19566

7. GSHARE activities during the balance of 1956 are of considerable
interest to us, 1 think Paragpaph 2 of the January 10 tentative
agenda is substantially correct, and I would 1ike to know how we
may best participate in order to avoid “slacking off" operations.

I imagine there will be an'intensification of local activities in

New England, New York, Los Angeles, and other areas., 1f past
experience is a basis for decision, we would very much like to see

2 monthly check sheet since it would tend to integrate a 704 operation.

8. I am enclosing the machine delivery date and configuration check list
which you sent to me. As you know, this information is subject to
change by IBM,., I believe the succeeding items on this agenda can best
be handled in discussions at the meeting.,

Mr. Douglas Ross, who is speaking at the Western Joint Computer Conference,
has agreed to attend the SHARE meeting a8 a 'listener” to bring back information
to MIT. However, since he is not a member of the Digital Computer Laboratory,
he will not be prepared to express the opinions of the Digital Computer
Laboratory group.

In regard to the SHARE address list, I hesitate to mention this, but there
are a foew errors in my particular listing. I have indicated below the preferred
mailing address and associated televhone number,

Br. rr&nk no Verzuh UN 4-6900, Exto 637
Kassachugetts Institute of Technology

77 Massachusetts Avenue

Canlwidge 39, Massachusetts

Perhaps you can enclose the correct listing in the proceedings of the fourth
meeting, or in your next revision of thig mailling list.

I am sorry that my plans do not pemmit me to attend the San Franeisco |
meeting. However, I wish you the best of luck for a noble undertaking. |

Sincerely yours,

F. M. Verzuh
Director
