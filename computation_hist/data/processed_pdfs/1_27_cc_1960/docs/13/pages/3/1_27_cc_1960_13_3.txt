-3-
of the routine has the symbolic name "." so that locations within

the program can be defined relative to that point by expressions

like ”0+95"

Q. The ARRAY table

 

 

Each entry in the ARRAY table is a pair consisting of the
name of an array used by the program and a symbolic expression
defining the length of the block reserved for the array. The
conventions will be adopted that the symbolic value of the name of
the array will correspond to the location of either the first or
the last-plus—one register in analogy to the BSS and BES pseudo-
operations of SAP.

There are two useful features when combining a group of
subprograms into a subprogram. The first feature is the convenience

of naming and marking the boundaries of the Subprogram. The

 

second feature is the ability to alter symbol names 80 that a
collection of subprograms can compatibly form a single program.
Both of these features are introduced by grouping LLS. Thus an

initial group card of the form

a GRP b,c,... F, u/v, ...y/z

and
a EGR

as an end group card cause the program enclosed between them to a
group named a. The symbols b, c, ...,f have the same meaning
outside the group as inside it. The symbols u, ...,y are the names

that outside the group correSpond to the symbols v, ...,2 inside the
