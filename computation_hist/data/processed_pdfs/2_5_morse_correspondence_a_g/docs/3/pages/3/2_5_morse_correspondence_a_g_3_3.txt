THE MIT AUTOMATIC CODING SYSTEM FOR THE IBM 704

 

The objective of asutomatic coding is to simplify the process of
solving problems using s digital computer., This is commonly done by pro-
viding the programmer with a coding language which is easier for him to
use than the computerâ€™'s own instruction code. Automatic coding can be ap-
proached on many levels--early systems (and meny later ones) employ a lan-
guage close to the machine language (machine-like), whereas more elsborate
recently-developed systems offer a coding language that approximates wmore
or less succesefully ordinary sigebraic notation (human-like).

For obvious reasons, =& human-like coding language is more ac~
ceptable to the everage coder than is a machine-like oune, It has the
virtue of familiarity; there is little mew to be learned, snd the re-
organization of thought made necessary by the computer is kept to a2 mini-
mum, Nonetheless, proficient coders often prefer to use a machine-like
language, objecting that the human-like ones are so far removed from the
details of the machine that the full capsbilities of the computer cannot
be exploited, OUCiten, therefore, the most advanced automatic coding sys-
temg are used by inexperienced coders, while the expertes choose to uti-
lize their intimate knowledge of the coumputer in ways permitted only in
machine code.

An autematic coding system, which, it is hoped, will be useful
to novice and expert coders &like, ig being developed for use cn the I B M.
704 at the H.E.T, Computation Cemter, The system is not yet in operation,
but its underiying philoscophy ies already clear, It is felt that the new
developments embodied in the M. I, 7. systes will be of interest to others
@t this time, The principal features of this systesm are:

1) The inciusion of an advanced human-like laenguage and of an
elementary machine~like language in one comprchensive coding systesm,
