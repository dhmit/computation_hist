Dear Dr. Morse:

It has come to our attention that you have been developing
computer solutions for fourth order biharmonic-type boundary value
problems. We are very interested in problems of this type and would
appreciate it very much if you could either send us copies of any
publications that have appeared on the subject by your group or tell
us where we can obtain them.

Thank you very much.

Sincerely yours,
