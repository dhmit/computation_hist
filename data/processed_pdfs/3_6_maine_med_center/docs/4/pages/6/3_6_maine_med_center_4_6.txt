In measurements of the distribution of potential around the chest at the mid-
ventricular level® the peak of the potential-gradient curve was usually from
3 to 8 cm. to the left of the mid-sternal line. FIGURE Sb shows, however, that
if the dipole angle is 90°, the potential-gradient curve is biphasic, with positive
and negative maxima equally spaced about the dipole center. 1In this case the
potential gradient at the point on thg b.oundfary nearest the dipole center is
zero. The points of zero gradient coincide with points of maximum or mipj.
mum potential, since at these points the curve of potential against distance
must have zero slope. Changes of reference potential would have absolutely
no effect on the potential-gradient curves and would cause only an upward or
downward shift of the entire potential curve.

Because of this fact no attempt was made to find an exact zero reference
potential. The reference electrode was placed either midway between the
poles of the dipole or at a remote point of the tank. It would have been
possible to use the reference potential at the junction point of two resistors, 4. 15
but this would have necessitated precautions to avoid any polarization of the
current electrodes. Frank and Kay'® have discussed the problems involved
with the above two types of reference systems. A more elaborate method is
that of Sugi,'® who put three electrolytic tanks “in series” by means of wicks
and put his reference electrode in a neutral tank. Experiments are now in
progress in this laboratory to adapt the double-layer tank® to measurements
in which a finite boundary is present in the upper layer. The technique is to
leave a very narrow gap in the boundary and to use the bottom layer electrode
as the reference point. The gap should have a negligible effect on the potential
distribution inside the boundary.

The effect of increasing the resistivity of the lung sections was also studied
for other dipole angles. The results are given in TABLE 1.

Dipole 0°. The only significant changes between the homogeneous section
and the section in which the lung areas had a resistivity ratio of 4 was that the
maximum potential-gradient increased by 12 per cent, and the potential
maxima on the boundary shifts in location by about 1 cm. When the ratio
increased from 4 to infinity the magnitudes of both positive and negative po-
tential maxima decreased, and the lateral-wall potentials also decreased. The
potential maxima were located much nearer the front of the section. These
effects may be explained by the increased shielding action of the lung sections.

Dipole 30°. As the resistivity ratio was changed from 1 to infinity the mag-
nitude of the maximum negative potential on the right side increased, but the
maximum positive potential on the left side fell. The side-wall potentials
varied in the same way. The left-side maximum potential dropped to about
one third of its original value, whereas the increase in right-side maximum
potential was only 13 per cent. The locations of the potential maxima anfi
zero points on the boundary did not change to any great extent. The maxi-
mum potential gradient increased in value as the resistivity ratio increased
from 1 to 4, and then decreased again as the ratio increased from 4 to infinity.
As the resistivity of the lung sections increased, the right lung tended to chann§l
the current toward the front of the thorax, and this caused the potential in this
region to increase. At the same time, however, the left lung impeded the flow

Column 1 is the dipole angle. Column 2 shows the resistivity ratio of the lung sections
(resistivity ratio 1 is the homogeneous section, and for ratios of 4 and infinity the insulating
spine and sternum sections were also in the tank). Columns 3 and 4 give the magnitude and
location of points of maximum positive and negative potential on the thorax boundary. Col-
umn 5 shows the location of the points of zero potential. Columns 6 and 7 show the magni-
tude and location of the peak of the potential-gradient curve on the boundary. Column 8
gives the potential at points on the right and left lateral walls of the thorax section, at dis-
tances from the mid-sternal line of —25 cm. and 425 cm.

of current to the left side of the thorax, and the potential in this region was
decreased.

Dipole 60°. Again, with increasing lung-resistivity ratio, the magnitude of
the maximum negative potential on the right side was increased, and the
maximum positive potential on the left side decreased. The location of the
potential maxima and the zero points showed a marked change. The maxi-
mum potential gradient showed a steady decrease, and the side-wall potentials
were considerably altered. The shape of the potential-gradient curve also

changed. At 46 cm. on the boundary, for example, the value of E changed
from 0.06 v./cm. to 0.03 v./cm. This means that the slope of the potential
curve is smaller, and the curve is more spread out, as found. It is possible,
however, that the increased negativity of the entire curve may be partly due
to a change in the reference potential.

Dipole 90°. The complete set of charts for the dipole at 90° is shown in
FIGURE 5, and it has been previously discussed. The complicated effect of
the inhomogeneous areas can again be emphasized by noting that as the lung-
resistivity ratio increased, the maximum negative -potential on the boundary
changed from —1.0 v. to —0.77 v. and back to —0.88 v. The fact that the
posterior sides and back were not more positive may possibly be due to the
shielding action of the spine section.
