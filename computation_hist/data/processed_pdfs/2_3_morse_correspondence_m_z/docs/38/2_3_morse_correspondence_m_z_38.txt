’ Dear Nn. HoCandless:

, Your Questionnaire herdly applies to M. I. T. He have been'»
des1gn1ns and using _nach1nes of all types s1nce 1936’ we haVe more_ M
rthan 25 computing machines of substantially greater complication ;
than a desk computer, some of them analogue, Some digital. We are
bu1lding:more and will buy more. But we do not 1ntend to buy mere

,machines, as their contribution to the vegy difficult task of
'training enough engineers with knowledge of machine behavior. For _
example, IBM is donating a 70k, to be installed next fall, free of ~
charge,- -tor education and general research. If you feel- that stu-

en a should also have contact with analogue machines during their
training, perhaps you should donate one of your best machines.

We are doing our best to educate our undergraduates and
graduates in computer practice.r We could do better if we had more
machines. Can you help?

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse, Director
