Dear Joes

AIEEE ha SSA ARE CLQ pr

Last time I saw you, you said that, if there
were any mathematics research, which would be done using y
our new IBM 704 here and which needed a modest amount of 3
support, you would be interested in hearing about 1% and 4
you might be able to support it.

The enclosed proposal, by Prof. Kemeny of 4
Dartmouth, appears to me to be of this sort, Prof. f
McCarthy, one of the co-workers mentioned in the pro- i
posal, 1s here at the Computation Center on leave from
Dartmouth, to get thoroughly acquainted with the machine
and with our staff, so if the proposal is supported, he
gould do the actual machine testing here. The planning
and the logical analysls could be done at Dartmouth.

 

I don't know whether recent budget cuts mean
you can't support new work or not. If your hands
are tied, mail thls back to me soon, 80 I can try other
sources. If you still have some freedom and are inter-
ested, I suggest you write directly to Prof. Kemeny for
further details.

Yours,
