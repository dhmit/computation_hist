The large problems described, as well as the smaller but
more numerous problems should not be preempted from the com-
puter because of compet¢ng time requirements of very large
users, including on-line¢ users. These requirements, when
combined wlth the need to minimize the waiting time to
actually state and run a probiem on a computer dictate that
a large machine, capable of time-sharing ar mulilprogrammning
be avallable. It further dictates that this machine must
have a very large immediate and backup random access storage,
in order to successfully keep many simultaneous customers
content with a fraction of its capabilities.

Our present research in time sharing on the 704 shows
that a machine can be successfully used in this fashion, and
that the requirements for extension teo a full blown system
with a large number of specilalized input output devices at
remore locatlions point in the direction of a streteh ¢lass
computer. A large number of small computers are not equiva-
lent both in the sense of having less capacity available to
the user and in the sense of the cost of computation.
