Dear Jacks:

This letter is to put in writing the position
of the Computation Center on the IBM 650, now rented by
the Office of Statistical Services. Under the present
"ground rules", as outlined by Dr. Shader several months
ago and again by you three weeks ago, we do not see how
the Center can take on the equipment. It would mean a
"double standard" operation, which would be dangerous to
our initial operation. |

Perhaps, next spring, we can re-examine the
matter again, and see whether, in the light of our experi-
ence, either we, or you, should change our "ground rales‚Äù.
And we are keeping space for the 650 in the Center, in case
the rules should be changed.

But at present I can only reiterate what I told
Drs. Shader and Hunter last March, and you last month,
that the Center cannot take the 650 under the present
rules laid down by IBM. You should discuss with Mr,
Cusick, who is in charge of the Office of Statistical
Services, when it should be removed.

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse
Director
