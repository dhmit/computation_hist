35 IBM representatives dealing with the New England universities, between
1:30 - 3:00 P, M. The following personnel will speak to the group at the

Since the IBM Corporation group will have held a closed meeting
during the morning, there is obviously a possibility of duplication of effort.
Accordingly, the time allotted for each talk hes been limited to approximately

15 minutes, and this may be expanded an questions indicate nced for it In
other words, we will have to play it somewhat by ear. J
