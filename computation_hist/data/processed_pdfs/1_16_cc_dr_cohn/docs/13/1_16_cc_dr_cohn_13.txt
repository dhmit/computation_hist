1, Introduction. The 1 consideration of relative extreme to corres 0nd
to the absolute extremum which is the critical lattice has been going on for Some
time- As far back as 1873, Korkine and Zolotareff [6] Worked with the ellipsoid
in hyperspace (Let, with quadratic forms), and later Minkowski [8] worked
with a general convex body in two or three dimensions. They showed how to ﬁnd

‘ Critical lattices by selection from among a ﬁnite number of relative extrema
l They were aided by the long»recognized premise that only a ﬁnite number oi
‘ lattice points can enter into consideration [1] when one deals with l
l “admissible to convex bodies."

In the realm of the more general star body, such as that involved in the
product of homogeneous forms, there is no ﬁniteness principle of equal scope.
Mahler [71 has, however, developed a local property for the critical lattices

l established by Davenport [3; 4], by using ”bounded reducibility.”

\ We shall develop a similar property which we shall Call stability and we shall
extend it to a large class of lattices for star bodies. We shall do this by introducing
a fomialism of positively dependent diﬂeremials. Then as an illustration. we shall

2 give a condition for stability of the norm in an algebraic module (a condition
which can be considerably simpliﬁed by the use of units in the Dedekind order [5]).

By homogeneity this depends on the n — 1 ratios of the n components of dach

arbitrarily closely by ratios from n components of integral lattice points. This

identically. The free dimension will be denoted by Q,

Conversely, if a lattice has these properties for some a, n and Q + 1 n-tuples

This is the type of property that Mahler [7] established for certain cases
where his theory of “bounded reducibility" applies. The property is an easy

The applications that follow (see §9) will stem from the following result:
Let the (inﬁnite) set of vectors {V} of 5" contain vectors arbitrarily close in
direction to 2Q vectors consisting of Q basis vectors and their negatives. We
shall call this latter conﬁguration a unit star. (Compare the “eutactic star” of
Coxeter [2, p. 401].) Suppose that a subsequence of iv} can be selected which
comes increasingly close in direction to any designated one of the 2Q vectors

To see this, ﬁrst note that the projection property is easy to obtain from the

The vectors are to come increasingly close to the 2Q vectors of the unit Star In
some order (without coinciding). Furthermore each vector is selected to be

(non-singular) module 9, called its order, which consists of all algebraic integers

the module of all integers in a ﬁeld (called an integer-module for short), then we
should have 5;) : 9)? and the minimizing x (or z) satisfying equations (7-1)
(01’ (7-2)) would be the units. In any case, S is also a ring with unity, and
according to the classical theory it contains r + .r - l fundamental units.
We Shall denote any unit by 1! (with conjugates ut). Thus for every solution X

As an immediate consequence of-this criterion, the integer-module of a ”a;
quadratic ﬁeld is stable if and only if there is a unit of norm —1. The inte er<
module of a totally real cubic ﬁeld is stable if and only if the units displaygall
possible 28 arrays of sign among their conjugates. For instance the totally real
cubic ﬁeld generated by 2 cos 21r/7 (of minimal discriminant = 49) easily has the
property, as we see by using as units conjugates of this generating element.
Hence the ﬁeld in question is stable [7].

as elegant as the last one, because lug/uj] = ]u,/u,,| not only whenj and lreier
