Dear Mr. 'ﬂortner:

Professor Morse has tot-waded to no your letter
requestins~intomtion on the solution or fourth order
biharnonio-type boundary value problems. I do not know anyone
who is solving anon problems at present. However, it is
qume possible that one or the 500 problems now using machine
time does involve the solution or suoh problems.

If you could give no some more detailed information

as to the source of me work, a further investigation would
be possible.

— I am enclosing a copy of the Computation Center's
semi-annual report which has rather extensive lists or the
work being done at the present time. This may be or help
in determining proper references.

Sincerely yours;

Dean N. Arden
Assistant Professor
of Electrical Engineering
