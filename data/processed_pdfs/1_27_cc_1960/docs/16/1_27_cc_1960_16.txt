Sub ject: Integration of Remote Console - Time Shared TO090 System
Operation into M. I. T's Educational Facilities

1. Background:

As part of our general preparation for the T7090 system, we
have been actively exploring the use of time - shared multipro-
gramming, with one or many input-output devices connected. We
have successfully demonstrated with our flexowriter project that
time - sharing is a feasable method of running and testing pro-
grams.

Ae M. I. T. explores more deeply the problems of teaching and
research, computers are cercain to have more applicability as a
teaching and research tool. This need will be fulfilled either by
providing a large number of relatively slow, limited capability com-
puting systems spread throughout classrooms and departments of the
Institutes; through time - shared usage of a large, fast, and versa-
tile system such as the 7090, or perhaps via a combination of both.

Based upon available information, the Committee assigned to
study this problem; namely, F. J. Corbato, J. McCarthy, and H. M.
Teager, recommend quite strongly that the possibility of a remote-
Console time shared T7090 system be broached with appropriate aathoritiss at &
early date, as 2n area deserving support improvement of teaching
facilities and techniques.

2, Specifications for the Proposed System:

At present, we are distinctly handicapped with respect to a
detalled understanding of the 7090 lo ic and construction.® Lack-
ing such information, it is extremely difficult To express feasa-
pility in terms of cost, or any other terms other than "We know how
to do it and we feel it will be a better solution than a multitude
of small machines’.

Basically, She system would be comprised of a T7090, several
disc files, 5 - 10 remote inquiry stations similar to the T7070
system stations (electric typewriters and some push buttons) , and
sufficient channels and electronic hardware to make the system work.
gome of the remote Lecture Hell stations would, in addition, be
equipped with self maintaining scope - displays and light pens.

# This is a policy matter that we feel should be broached at a high
revel with [BM in securing their cooperation.

.v each user of a remote console, the T7090 system would appear to
be a slower running machine, but he would have available to him any
of the powerful programming and diagnostic systems now in use, as
well as a large central filing system for his own programs and discs.
Problems of program safety¥* and accounting can be presently solved
with known techniques.

3. Problems to be Studied and Solved:
1. Hardware - As has been previously stated, not enough is pre-
sently known about the T7090 design to give definite specifications
for what is needed. However, there are several "Must" items that
can best be provided through IBM that can (by their lack) invali-
date this as a feasable system. The lack of these items 1s not
too probable if IBM cooperation is achieved at a high level on the
basis of the novelty, and general applicability of the system.
A) Disc files - A must item. Our prior specs for a T7090 system
do not include discs since IBM has not announced them for the
T7090. They have, however, equipped a sister machine, the T7070,
with low speed d:8e¢8. These will be invaluable in providing
random access to programs and programming systems to all con-
current users.
B) Remote Inquiry Stations - Another must item. Such inquiry
stations should be wire connected to the 7090 in order to mini-
mize both cost and maintenance. Although flezowriters could be
used, we would be far better off in using the remote inquiry
stations that IBM uses with the TO70 system, or possibly with
their 305 system.
C) Guard or Boundary Registers - A definite highly desirable
itenmt® In time shared usage, the problem of program compata-
bility becomes of paramount interest. Lacking such registers,
the solutions to compatibility will either limit the overall
speed of the system ( as in our flexo monitor - interpretive
system where speed drops by some 40 ) or else the flexibility
of the system by restricting the programmer to completely safe,
and foolproof program systems. IBM has developed such registers
for their "stretch" system, but it would be highly unlikely that

memory

## But presently unlikely on the 7090 due to cost.


Fut

they could be available on the T090 without IBM cooperation.
D) Alarm Clocks, Self Maintaining Scope Displeys, ete. - Such
items are desirable, but can be designed with available talent
exclusive of IBM.

4, Conclusions and Recommendations:

It is therefore recommended that the system be broached with
appropriate authorities at an early date, and further that high
level representation be made to IBM to assure cooperation.
