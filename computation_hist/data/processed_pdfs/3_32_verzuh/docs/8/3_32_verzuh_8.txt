Dear Mr. Harder:

Enclosed you will find an abstract or the
paper which I am to

present at the A.I.E.E. Winter

Solution 2: Boundary-Value Problems 25

Automatic Computing Eggipment

by
Dr. Frank M. Verzuh

w

This paper is primarily concerned with the solution
of boundary—value problems by means of automatic computin
equipment (both analogue and digital). Specifically, in

addition to the familiar desk calculator, the following
digital computers were used in this stud i

y the type 602A
Electromechanical Calculator, the type 604 Electronic

Calculator, the Card—Programmed Calculator, and the M.I.T.
Whirlwind Computer. The enlogue studies were obtained by
use of the M.l.T. Rockefeller Differential Analyzer.

This study is primarily concerned with the solution
of ordinary differential equations in which certain

boundary conditions are specified at two or more values
of the independent variable.

Such problems are generally
called boundaryovalue problems.

It is clearly evident
that the solution of such problems is inherently more

difficult than the solution of initial-value problems in
which all conditions are specified at one point. The
particular problems studies are further complicated by the
fact that their solutions are required over an infinite
range which contains regions of nonranalyticity.

A computational philosophy is presented which emphasizes
that a machine must be evaluated on a firm engineering and

economic basis-—e basis which must include the entire
computational procedure. An evaluation to given of the

relative advantages and limitations of the five computers
used in this study.
