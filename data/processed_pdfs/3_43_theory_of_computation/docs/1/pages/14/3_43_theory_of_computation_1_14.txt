X such that 7(x) is true. Unless there is such
an x and it is unique € ((x) ,m(x)) is undefined.

In the case of the integers((((x),m(x)) can be
defined in terms of the wniversal quantifier using
conditional expressions, but this does not seem to
be the case in domains which are not cffectively
cnumerable, and one may not wish to do so in
domains where enumeration is unnatural,

The next step is to allow quantification over
functions. This gets us to Klecne's® analytic
hierarchy and presumably allows the functions used
in analysis. Two facts are worth noting, First
‘d((f), ¢(£)) refers to all functions on the
domain and not just the computable ones, If we
restrict quantification to computable functions,
we get different results. Secondly, if we allow
Tunctions which can take themselves as arguments,
it is difficult to assign a meaning to the
quantification, In fact, we are apparently con-
fronted with the paradoxes of naive set theory,

o9. Ambiguous Functions

Ambiguous functions are not really functions,
For cach prescription of values to the arguments
the ambiguous function has a collection of possible
values, An example of an ambiguous function is
less(n) defined for all positive integer values
of n, Every non-negative integer less thah n is
>

2 possible value of less(n). If we define a basic

ambiguity operator anb(x,y) whose possible values
are x and y when both are defined otherwise which-
ever is defined, w

e

¢ can define less(n) by
less(n) = anb(n-1 . ]osss(n-l.)“)“:h
less(n) has the property that if we define
ult(n) = (nnO-ﬂ-O,T-ﬁ-ult(lcss(n)))

then .

7 ( () ultM)=0) = 9.

6. Recursive Definitions of Sets R o

In the previous sections on recursive defi-
nition of functions the domains and ranges of the
basic functions were prescribed and the defined
functions had the same domains and ranges.

In this section we shall consider the defi-
nition of new sets and the basic functions on
them. TFirst we shall consider some operations
