"purchased”" Time on the WW1l Computer during the six-month
period July 1 - December 31, 1955

e+ ——————————————

In accordance with our discussions regarding ways and means
for financing the M. I. T. Computation Center involving the
704 operation, I have prepared a four-page summary of "purchased"
time on the WW1l Computer broken down on a project basis.

It should be mentioned that the charge for the use of this
computer falls into a number of categories:

1. Guaranteed time charged at an equivalent rate of
$3.205/hour of WWl time.

2. Regular charge at a rate of $4.167/hour of WW1 time.

Tom Crane, Research Fiscal Officer, and I will meet to discuss
a possible revision of the current billing procedure,

During this six-month period the "purchased time" usage of
WW1l breaks down as follows:

Aero-elastic Allocation Account 1028.1 $ 3,295.05
Servomechanisms Account 1065.2 3,413.96
Civil Engineering 480.0 1,538.40
Instrumentation Allocation Account 1500.0 4,807.50
Meteorology Department 843.0 2,701,.82
Geology Department 833.1 2,670.08
Buerger 287 .4 921.13
Research Laboratory of Electronics 1080.0 4,500.37
Misc. non-guaranteed billings 1209.3 5,039.19

GRAND TOTAL. . .8326.1 $ 28,887.50

The attached four-page summary provides a detailed breakdown
of the individual projects and sponsors involved. I think it is
a simple matter to be able to determine which laboratory should
contribute how much for the 704 operation. I am looking forward to
discussing this matter at our next meeting on Tuesday, February 14,
