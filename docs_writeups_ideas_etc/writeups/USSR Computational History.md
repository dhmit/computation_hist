Article written in Nautilus, respected American magazine specializing in connecting science to the broader context- historical, philosophical, political

Written by Slava Gerovitch, a Russian Mathematics professor at MIT

Research in history of math, cybernetics, computing

Has several books- Soviet Space Mythologies and From Newspeak to Cyberspeak look particularly interesting

Soviets criticized Americans for computer science development, particularly cybernetics

Norbert Wiener, an MIT mathematics professor and a leader in the field of cybernetics, was particularly criticized
Boris Agapov was the first of Wiener’s Soviet critics, but he did not read Wiener’s work- focusing instead on what he could glean from TIME magazine and pictures. This trend of criticism lacking much evidence was continued from here on.
Wiener’s quotes were taken out of context for many of the criticisms

At the same time as these critiques were happening, military realized they needed computers, started secret research
MESM- first Soviet computer, M-1 first Soviet small computer

In capitalist(!) style competition, two Soviet teams aimed to develop the better computer

Strela won initially

Loser, BESM, became fastest in Europe after some modifications

Even when developing computers secretly, Russian developers couldn’t use words to refer to computers that could link back to cybernetics, such as words that might imply computers might be able to think

After Stalin’s death, disciplines he has suppressed slowly made a return, and cybernetics finally began to become a legitimate discipline

New ideology- computers are the “machines of communism”

US began to feel threatened by Soviet commitment to cybernetics, but didn’t realize it was mostly used to propagate their current systems
When Soviets tried to standardize their entire system with computing, it was too bureaucratic and power based, exaggerating the problems with their political system and leading to their downfall
