l) lvaluetion of ballistic tables,

2) Guided nissile stability and perfornance studies.

a) Lead cuputing sight calibration atudies,

4) Studies of aircraft propeller perfornsnce equations.

5) Study of the design characteristics of “Marines, torpedos,
and other underwater craft,

6) Study of the design of cats-areas enploying the hydrofoil principle.
7) Study of thee operations research prohlen dealing with snharine warfare.
a) Study, design and performance of antisircraft nissiles such es like, etc.

 

As s natterd fact, the contributions node by the Analyzer were considered
to be sufficiently inportant that the Navy Depnrment issued the level Ordnance
Develop-eat Award in recognition of the work Iperforsed by the Differential Analysers
and associated ouputing staff.

in addition to such atudies, the Analyzer was used to design new types of
lead coaputing sights, tracking systole. aircreft cuponent design, etc. This type
of activity was carried on by the lnstrunentation Laboratory during the years
1950-1954.

It is evident fro. the shove partial list of prams-s that the Anelyser was
prinarily used for the solution of nilitary problens. However, there were a
umber of industrial prohlens-‘oolved on thin nechine. For era-pie:

1) Study of the perfornance of a roped-charge,

2) Study of circuit aolution of electrical networks,

3) Analysis of the dynnnic perfornance of servaechnnisns.

_4_) Studies associated vith heat flow prohlus.

5) Study of a prohlm in ennyne kinetics, '

6) Studies of the atmospheric oscillation of the upper auosphere,

1) Studies of' a boundary value problen eesocia-tedvuith the design of
an ultra centrifuge,

In addition to the above industrial problses, the nschine was used to e
liaited extent for the solution of ‘ecndenic problens arising in ll.l.l‘. thesis
reaee'rch. for example,

1) Investigation of nircrsft performance and control.

2) Investigation of the performance of nagnetic relay circuits,

3) Investigation of the stability of zyroscopee,

4) Investigation of the orbit of dyna-ically-loaded Journal hearings.
5) Investigation of statistically—lowed machine hearings.

6) Study of nagnetic amplifiers,

1) Investigation of the rolling characteristics of ship Iodels.

8) Study of 11.1.1. servonechanisna,

9) Study of differentiation with elmnts of the Differential Annlyner,
10) Investigation of Schriidinger‘s Have Equation,
ll) Boxmeville mar load allocation study.

It is evident from the above list of problems solved on the Differential
Analyzer that it was used predominantly for nilitary and D, l. c. sponsored
