MEMORANDUM TO: S.I.M. Staff Members

FROM: S.I.M. Committee on Computing Machine Usage, S. S. Alexander,
David Durand, and J. W, Forrester, Chairman

The M.I.T. Computation Center with its 70L Computer is now available
for use. Projects sponsored by M.I.T. research funds or by grant-in-aid
funds may use the computer at no charge. DSR projects, either commercial
or military, may have a charge levied against them, assuming that they
are eligible for machine time.

 

 

The Computation Center i1s a new installation and it will require

 

some patience on the part of staff members while we all learn the proper

 

way to expedite machine usage. For those staff members unfamiliar with

 

 

the Computation Center, it will be necessary to leam something about both

 

the procedure for submitting work to the Center and about the technical ,
details of computer usage and programming.
To expsdite the use of the Center and to make it more effective, we
will attempt to provide, in the Management School, a central advisory
service. The Computation Center makes availeble some research assistante
ships with the intent that these research assistants shall act as liaison
staff 'between their departments and the Computation Center. We may soms-
times be able to augment the Computation Center asgistantships with ones
from the School itself.
In order that the research assistants may be as effective as possible,
we are asking that they all report to one staff member, Mr. Jack Arnow, for
general advisory and policy guidance and for assignment to particular staff
members. Mr, Arnow has had extensive experience in computing machine usage
and, in this advisory and research assistantship assignment capacity, will
report to this Committee,
