Dear Professor Morse:

As a member of the Advisory Panel for University Computing
Facilities, you will recall that at the October meeting it was
recommended that the Foundation consider making a public announce=
ment of the program at the appropriate time,

After careful consideration, it was concluded that information
about the program would reach the competent people interested in
computation on the basis of existing knowledge, In any case the
time has come when formal proposals in line with the program ars

now awaited in the Foundation,

Sincerely yours,
