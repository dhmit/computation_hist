Ch,., Faculty Committee on
The Computer Facility

Drexel Institute of Technology

Philadelphia 4, Pennsylvania

Dear Professor McNeary:

We are glad to hear that you are joining the group of
colleges which have operating computing facilities. I am afraid
I have no suggestions to make at present concerning a possible
director but I do have communication with quite a number of
people who from time to time are interested in changing positions.
If, in the near future, I hear of such a case and it appears
appropriate, I would suggest that the person write you directly
concerning the position,

I hope that when you get started you will put this
Center on your distribution list of reports of activity. We get
out a Semi-Annual Progress Report, Would you like us to send it
to you?

Sincerely yours,

Philip M, Morse
Director
