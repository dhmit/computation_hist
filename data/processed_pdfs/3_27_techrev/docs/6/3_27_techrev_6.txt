Dear Dud:

We are in the process of collecting material for a
biennial report to our Sponsors. i have a feeling that some
of the material we collect would make a good basis for an
article or articles.

I will keep this in mind and will get in touch with

you sometime in December.

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse
