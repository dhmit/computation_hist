SUBJECT: M.I.T. 704 Post-ilortem Routine
AUTHOR: A. Siegel

DATE: November 26, 1956

The post-mortem routine described in this report is being prepared for
uss on the J.I.T. 704 and for SIARE distributions It is a selective memory print-
out or punch~out routine for use as an aid in trouble-shooting. The registers of
core memory to be recorded and the form in which the output is to be produced ere
specified using either symbolic request cards or the computer console. The ovtput
igs in the notation of the SHARE Assembly Program (SAP), including the symbols of
the original program if they are requested. The routine is designed for vere
gatility end consist@ncy with the SAP notation, in order that the coder may get

exactly the infor.ubivi: u» wants in exactly the form he wants it.

As described in this report, the symbolic request cards are read and
translated by the postemortem routine before their exacution. This translation
can more efficiently be done by the compiler, and any future Me.I.T. compiler will
probably do this. It is possible to modify SAP to accept these cards, and there-
by combine the assembly and post-mortem routines into an efficient service-yroutine
package. However, the post-mortem routine may be used as described here, whether
or not such changes ure aade in SAP.

Symbolic Post-mortem Requests « the PAR Card

The SUARE card format (comprising symbol field, operation fisld and
variable field) is reteined in the request cards. Card requests are identified
by the letters PilR (Post=Mortem Request) in the operation field. The varieble
field in the UR card contains four expressions separated by commus and Lermine
ated by & blank column.

The first two expressions give the initial und final addresses of the
block in core memory to be printed or punched. These two expressions are of the
sume form es expressions in SAP, and may include symbols. The ¥aird expression
indicates the form in which the words are 10 be produced, and consists ol one of
the following ebbreviati.nsg:

FLO Floating-point numbers

FIX Fixed-point numbers, scaled with binary
exponent x and decimal exponent y (following
SAP notation). lhe scaling information may
be omitted to obtain BU EO.

Fixed-point integors (decinnl)

SREY Tnetructions with symbolic addresscs

ABS Instruction with absolute uddresser

The four eXpreaslens, taken togsl.er, completely specify a single output request.
As an example , the card

will cause the post-mortem routine to record the contente of registera SABCHT |
through SXYZe2, as floating-point numbers, om the :nagnetic tepe designated for
use with the off-line card punch. After obeying this request the routine will, |
in the absence of manual intervention, proceed Uo obey the next card in sequence. |

Remarke~-the Pid Card

Following the four expressions in the variable field of the FLR card
and separated from them by at least one blank column, there may appear any alpha-
mmerical comment. This comment will be reproduced by the post-mortem routine,
and will appear immediately preceding the first line of output resulting fron the
PUR card. In the case of punched output, the comment will appear as an REI
card, which is ignored dy SAP.

In addition, REM cards themselves will be read by the post-mortem
routine, and will be treated in the same way as comments in the variable field.
ach RE! ecard will be recorded jusb before the nest following PiR card 13 obeyed.
Thie facility provides the user with a method for labelling the post-mortem
output and identifying his results.

Terminating the Post-mortem--the TRA, TTR, and HTR Cards

puR and RE! cards will be read in sequence until a card terminating tae {
sequence is encountered. This terminating card must contain one of the operati.ns
TRA, TTR, or HIR in its operation field; the variatle field expresses an address
exactly as it does in SAP. In response TO one of these terminating instructions,
the contents of core memory und of the arithmetic element will be restored and tae
terminating instruction will be executed. This permits eitiier resuming computation

or halting the computer after the completion of the posv-mortem request sequence.

The Symb ol Table

: The use of synlols by the post-mortem routine implies thai the symbol
table will be mude accessible to ite. With the SHARE Assembly Program in its

present form, this is most conveniently accomplished by using the binary symbol-
table deck provided by the asscmbler. ¥ % ya

fr If any symbols at all appear in the request curds, this binary deck must
be inserted in the curd reader together with the roguest curds. No binary louder
should be used, for the synbol table will be read by the post-mortem routine to

2 core memory location which does not necessarily coincide with tne location
