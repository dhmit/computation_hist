Mary Lister for post doctoral research associateship. After consild-
eration of her record, the Committee agreed to support the Mathematics
Department's ‘eccommendation.

Forrester brought up the problem of IBM and RDA charges for
computation time for research, and questioned whether the project
supporting these machines could not also support a fraction of
research time in the manner similar to the Whirlwind arrangement.
Morse sald he and Verzuh would try o work out an arrangement.

Feshbach brought up the guestion as to whether a full-time
analyst should not be added to the staff of the projeet to help get
