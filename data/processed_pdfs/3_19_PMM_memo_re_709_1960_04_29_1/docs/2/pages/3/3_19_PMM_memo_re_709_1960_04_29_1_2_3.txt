In part, this philosophy stemmed from the belief that al-
most any problem that could be stated or programmed could be
solved by a computer without any further outside assistance.

Almost none of the above generalizations are true today.
As will be shown, there are very compelling reasons for bring-
ing a computer and the human user into much closer contact.
There 18 every reason to believe that it will result 1n a more
efficient system; the latest generation of computers can be
multiprogrammed and time-shared among many different simulta-
neous users:; and there is a large class of computer usage that
1s impossilble in any other mode than real time.

There are still a host of research and development prob-
lems to be solved involving systems, input-output devices, and
computer programming before a large machine can be effectively
used in such a manner, but the goal is within reach. The ob-
ject of the proposed research program is to bring it about.
Let us examine more carefully the basic needs that are to be
served by the proposed system.

Computer Usage Problems
a. Artificlal Intelligence

The most compelling reason for achleving a closer
contact and cooperation between human and machine is that there
1s a growing class of problems that cannot be handled effective-
1y by either alone. Work in "Artificial Intelligence", i.e.
abstract problem solving by machine is tending in the direction
of heuristic programming; that is, instead of seeking to solve
combinatorial problems exhaustively (an lmpossible task in most
cases of interest) "common sense" or heuristic techniques for
avolding the exploration of the majority of possible solutions

to a problem Solving situation are being developed. 1In all but
