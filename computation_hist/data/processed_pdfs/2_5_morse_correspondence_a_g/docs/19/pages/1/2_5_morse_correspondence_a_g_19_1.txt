This letter is in answer to your of November 1 to
Professor W. '1‘. Msrtin or the Department of Mathematics. ll‘he
Institute is of course were of the need for training persons
in the use of high-speed computing equipment. We have here en
intensive program or educstion in this field involving nearly
s dozen courses, a spectrum of assistsntships and a professionsl
seminar in the subject. Consequently, I am not sure that we sre
quite in the position of needing 11 ”sales talk" as to the
importance of this field. We have one and will shortly have
two high-speed ounputers and our students have access to these
machines. Consequently, s highly technical talk on specific
uses of machines or on speeisl programs which might be used on
machines such as the IBM 7018 might be of interest in our
seminar. If one of your technical experts on machine use has
some material or this sort, we would be interested to have him
sddress our seminar some time in the Spring. Before we can
schedule such s talk, however, I would suggest that the person
who might come should write to me outlining the proposed sub-t
Ject matter and suggesting a. possible title.

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse, Director
