Voods Hole Oceanographic Institution
Voods Hole, Massachusetts

Dear Dr, Fye:

The agreement between IBM and MIT, under which we have use
of the 704, makee it available to students and faculty of educational
institutions in New England, Because already the demands for machine
time are outstripping our allotted time, we have had to interpret
this strictly, that only institutions in New England, granting masters
and/or doctors degrees, are eligible for time, We are sorry we have
to be so strict, but it is obvious that one 704 will not nearly
satisfy the needs for machine time in these institutions, let alone
others in this region,

I would be glad to talk things over with Dr, Bryan when he
is in Cambridge and to tell him some of the things we are doing in
meteorology. I suggest he give me a week's notice of his visit so I
can be sure to be able to see him,

Sincerely,

Philip M, Morse
Director
