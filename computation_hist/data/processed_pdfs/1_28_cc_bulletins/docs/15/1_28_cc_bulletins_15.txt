Subject: FORTRAN Modifications and Additional Format Features

eet ee a ———

Introduction

Periodically corrections for Fortran II are issued by the IBM
Applied Programming Graip in New York City. As soon as these corrections |
are received by the Center, they are incorporated into our FORTRAN Library
Tape. Occasionally, however, modifications are released which are of
considerable interest to the Fortran users. For example, on December 21
we received a memorandum which contains a number of interesting modifications
to Fortran, The following sections of this memorandum contain a verbatim
statement of these changes as released by the IBM Applied Programming Unit.

FORTRAN MODIFICATIONS/ADDITIONAL FORMAT FEATURES

Format facilities have been expanded, in the new Input-Output
Hollerith Routine (IOH), as follows:

1. The control character X; written nX, where 04 n £120.

a) I0H, on input, will interpret this to mean that the fol-
lowing n characters of input should be skipped.

Coos READ 1, K, A
1 FORMAT (12X, 12, 8X, F8.3)

This will cause cols. 1-12 to be skipped, cols. 13-14 (EK) to be read,
colz., 15-22 to be skipped, and cols. 23-30 (A) to be read.

b) IOH, on output, will interpret this to mean that the fol-
lowing n characters of output should bes blanks.

Oo: PRINT 1, K, A
(1 as in the above example)

This will print E, preceded by 12 blanks, and A, preceded by 8 blanks.

2) ICH, om input, will interpret this to mean that the fol-
lowing n successive fields of w characters each 2 re to be converted from
octal to binary. If w is greater than 12, only the 12 right-most characters
will be significant, If w is less than 12, the number will be right-
adjusted and filled out with zeros. leading blanks will be treated as zeros.

to a and the number will be signed if negative. However, 12 or more
signi fi igits will be unsigned.

4. Format Statements read in at object time.

FORTRAN will accept a variable Format address. This
provides the facility of describing a List at object time.

e.g: DIMENSION FMT (12)
1 FORMAT (12A6)
READ 1, (FMT (I), I = 1, 12)
READ FMT A, B, (C(I), I = 1,5)

Thus A, B, and C would be converted and stored according to the
Format Specification read into the array, FMT, at object time.
