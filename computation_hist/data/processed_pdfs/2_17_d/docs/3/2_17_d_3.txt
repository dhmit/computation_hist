colleges which have operating computing facilities. I am afraid
I hove no suggestions to make at present concerning a possible

people who iron time to time are interested in changing positions.
It, in the near future, 1 beer of such a one and it appears

appropriate, I would suggest that the person write you directly
concerning the position.

I hope that when you get started you will put this
Center on your distribution list of reports of sctivity. Ie get

out a. Berni-Annual Progress Report. Would you like us to send it
