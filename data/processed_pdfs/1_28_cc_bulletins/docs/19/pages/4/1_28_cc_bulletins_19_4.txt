Runs are execu

in sequence without stopping th

stop occurs in a program,
The execution of a particular run may be conveniently broken up

into the following three phases
Phase 1: The Translation Phase

Phase 2; The Operation Phase
Phase 3: The Processing Phase
which always occur in order,

The translation phase assembles the decks which form the run and
records them, in absolute binary form, on the BINARY INPUT TAPE, Each deck
must be preceded by a direction card whose operation field defines the
kind of deck which follows, We have

SAP: SHARE Symbolic Deck

BIN: Column Binary Deck

PMD: MIPMR1 Post-Mortem Request Deck

FTN:  FORTRAN1 Symbolic Deck
It is possible for a run to consist entirely of translation time but normal-
ly the run proceeds to operation time after all the dé'cks involved have been
assembled,

During the operation time the various decks which have been as~

sembled
and recorded on the BINARY INPUT TAPE may be brought to memory and

executed in
any sequence, Post-mortems may also be executed and results

are record
orded in binary form on the BINARY OUTPUT TAPE, If an error Stop

occurs during a user's
program, the computer operator may, by a simple

process, con
) tinue automatic operation, The user then has the option of

continuing his run
! or of terminating it and executing a special list of
mortems called error post-mortems

CC-75-1 i,

Processing time begins after operation time has been terminated,
The processing phase translates the binary post-mortem results recorded
on the BINARY OUTPUT TAPE to symbolic BCD form and records them on the
proper output unit (on-line printer, on-line punch, PRINTER OUTPUT TAPE
or PUNCH OUTPUT TAPE), At the end of processing time the operator pro-
gram proceeds to the translation phase for the next run,

In the following chapters we describe each of the three phases
in detail, An attempt has been made to completely describe the operator
program in as few words as possible, A more leisurely development of the
system can be found in the "User's Introductory Manual to the MIT Auto-

matic Operator Program',
