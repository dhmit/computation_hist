.-’Dear Leon:

 

 

. =k enoloae a press release on the danation by
IBM of the 704, which should get here about January 1957.
This generous arransemont will make available to us, and

to other universities in New England, an up-to-date

digital computer without operating or maintenance cost.

To be a truly effective instrument for research, however,

we must also have a research staff to develop, in connec-
tion with the machine, a better understanding of coding
logiec, and techniques of programming and numerical analysis,
to investigate procedures for recording and machine process-
ing of large-quantity experimental data, including programs
for its statistical analysis and ite display in quickly ega
understandable form and to prepare manuals and sab-routines
for use with this and other machines.

I believe 1% would be apprOpriate for NSF to
support a part of the expenses of such a research group,
to the tune of about g100,000 for three years (325,000
starting July 1956 and about £35,000 for each of the
succeeding two years) and I am requesting a poliecy decision
on this in the near future. I will let you know soon what
the outcome is. _

Yours,
Philip M. Morse
