Brooklyn 1, New York

Dear Professor Harker:

The IBM 704 to be installed at M.I.T.
during the spring semester is primarily for the
use of New En land-eolleges in education and -
open research (non-project). We have not contem-
plated making time available for other institutions,
outside New England; nor can we until we see
whether there will be any time left over after
satisfying those institutions which have a primary
lien on machine time. Since this will take some
time to decide it will not delay matters if you
arrange to drop in on me whenever you happen to
be in Cambridge in the next two or three months,
and give me more details of your needs, your present
Support and your relationships with the educational
activities at Brooklyn Polytechnic. Perhaps by
next spring we can begin to work out some of our
policies in regard to "outsiders" use of the Center.

Please give me a week's notice when

you do plan to be here, so I ean arrange to spend
Some time with you.

 

Sincerely,

Philip M. Morse
Professor of Physics
