funds will be made gt some later date at our mutual convenience. It is
our intention to terminate the present ONR project effective June 30, 1958,
and any new Programs with the MiT Computation Center will be set up as a
Separate and Completely new project.

On Janusry 31, 1957 the unexpended balance in Project 6345 was
$87,339, 1r We assume that the present average monthly expenditure of
$10,000 Continues, there will be an unsxpended balance of $27,000 in thig
account on June 30, 1957. This is sufficient to allow us to complete the
zbove-mentioned task orders during the succeeding figeal period--with the
much reduced complement of personnel.,
