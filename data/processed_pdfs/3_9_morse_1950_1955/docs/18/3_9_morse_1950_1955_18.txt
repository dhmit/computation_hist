Dear Professor Morse:

Enclosed you will find a memorandum entitled "Operational
Aspects Associated with Various M.I.T. Computing Facilities" which
you requested 1 prepare as part of the report by the Committee on
Machine Methods of Computation.

You will note that this memorandum is of greater length
than you requested; however, the early sections, in partcular
Tables I and II, contain data arranged in tabular form, and the
succeeding sections contain additional data of an explanatory nature.
I hope the tables may be of direct use in your report.

Sincerely yours,

F. M. Verguh
