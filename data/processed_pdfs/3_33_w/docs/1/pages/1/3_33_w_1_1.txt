Dear Phil:

» During the past three years Martin Greemberger, John Korbel, Alice
Rivlin, and I have been engaged in developing a new approach to the analysis
and prediction of the behavior of soclo-sconomic systems, We have given many
tens of talks on our worke Three theses at Harvard have consisted of major
pieces of it, We have prepared many papers and several of these have either
been published or are in the process of being published, The most extensive
write-up of our work is Decision<Unit Models and Simmlation of the United
States Foonomy. I have emclosed a copy of this dralte Excerpts

appear section 1.3 of the January 1958 report on Research and Educational
Activities of the Cooperating Colleges of New England,

Our work, in which the M,I,T, Computation Center has played such a
central role, has consisted up to this point of developing the gemeral
Pramework of this new kind of a model of a social economys of extensive work
on various pieces needed in such models; of development work on computer
techniques needed in estimating pieces of such models and in simlating
such models; and in writing and debugging a large-scale, specific program for
similating a concrete demographic model of the United States household sector,

We are now at a critical juncture in our worke We are under contract
with Harpers to publish a book on our work and I have agreed to do a piece for
Scientific American, We had originally hoped to have this book completed by
Tast fall, but due to unforeseen programming difficulties, my move to Wiscensin,
and Alice Rivlin's joining the full-time staff of Brookings Institution, we have
been slowed up, We are extremely amxious to have our volume ready for the
printer by the end of the summer, This book, of which I enclose a slightly
out of date table of contents, is nearly completely written, The major remaining
gap is a critical one and consists of the chapter or chapiers describing the
results obtained by a simmlation study of owr demographic model, The specific
model itself is largely the work of Alice Rivlin and is our first really selfe
contained model of the United States Economye The specific computer program
for similating this model was written and debugged by Martin Greenberger and the
group of three or four that worked under him, As far as we can tell, the
program is in good working order, What we need to complete this major phase
of our work is enough production runs to align our model with aggregative time
series datas to investigate some of its more important properties; and to use
it for making at least one or two runs for a few years beyond 1959, We estimate
that to do this on a satisfactory minimal basis will require approximately 100
hours of 70h computing timee
