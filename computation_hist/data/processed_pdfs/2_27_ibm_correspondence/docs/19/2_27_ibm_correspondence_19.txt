from 9:00 - 3:00 P. M., I have prepared a brief agenda for the MIT poxtion

These brief talks will be presented in Room 26-188. The demops‘ration of
the 704 will, of course, be held in the Recoption Roos, followc¢d by & tour
through the EAM and other areas of the Cen‘er.

As part of this program we shovid distriiute <4e following material:

1. A list of Institutional Bepresentatsives in the MIT
cooperative program,

2. Form CCF-1, Policy for Usv of the 704 Corputer,

3. Form CCF-6, Performance Reyuest Card,

4. Semi-Annual Report No. 3,

Since the IBM Corporation group wiil have held a closed meeting
during the morning, there is obviously a possibility of duplication of effort.
Accordingly, the time allotted for each talk has been limited to approximately

15 minutes, and this may be expanded as questions indicate need for it In
other words, we will have to play it somewhat by ear. J
