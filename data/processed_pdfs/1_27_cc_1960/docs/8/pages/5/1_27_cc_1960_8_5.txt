Molecular Quantum Mechanies-Dr. M. Barnett
Dr. Barnett is attempting to predict through molecular

quantum mechanics the chemical and physical behavior of
gases and fuels. To handle even a simple case, involving a
molegule of 5-6 atoms with, on the order of, 20 electrons
would require about 50 hours of 704 time. The basic reasons
for this order of time requirement is that the potentlal
funetions are highly specialized and complex, which in ma-
chine terms requires a large amount of storage, easy access
and very fast computation. e
Crystalographic Data Reduction-Dr. M. Barnett

Dr. Barnett is attempting to enable physical chemlsts
to infer molecular structure from erystalographic data. The
problem again requires large processing requirements because
it is essentially an iteratlive process, requiring for each
of the many possible molecular configurations, the computa-
tion of electron densities that would correspond to the data.
Since even the electron density computations are involved,
and there are a large number of molecular structures with a
given set of atoms, the time requirements are c¢learly beyond
the TO4. |
Solld State Physies-Dr. M. Barnett

To prediect the electrical and mechanical properties of
a metal or alloy from energy level considerations requires on
the order of 15 hours. Since there is no limit to the num-
ber of possible alloy combinations, thls class of problems
alone can clearly keep a very large machine occupled full time.
Mechanical Translation-Dr. ¥Yngve

Until recently, Dr. ¥ngve's group has been occupled large-
1y with development of a programming language for linguistics.
The large scale usage of thils language in solving research
problems in translation have yet to be felt by the Center.
As of today, even a moderate amount of translation (which re-
quires much relatively immediate random access To a large
dictionary and consideration of contextual meanings) would
