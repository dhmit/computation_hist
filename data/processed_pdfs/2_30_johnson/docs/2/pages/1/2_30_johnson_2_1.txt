Dear Dr. Johanson:

In accordance with our discussions at the conference
with Messrs. Gledhill and Musgrove and yourself at the meeting
on July 10, I have prepared the attached 1list of cable require-
ments for the MIT installation. Specifically, this list includes
the following three principal items:

( .

1) Cables for the Type 738 Core Unit

2) Cables for the second off-line Printer (727-757-717)

3) Cables for the Off-Line Punch (727-758-722)

4) Cables for the Off-Line Reader (714-759-727).

In order to determine the number and length of cables required,
a new drawing of the Computation Center Machine Room layout was
prepared on July 8 (Drawing CCD-1). This drawing indicates the
exact revised layout of the IBM machines using a 3/8"-per-foot

scale.

I have provided Mr. Gledhill with copies of this drawing
indicating the layout of cables in order that I may check the
lengths of cables which I have ordered. (We did this jointly at
our meeting on Thursday, as you recall.)

I would appreciate receiving the exact day of delivery
of the 738 and 717 equipment in order that 1 may properly schedule
the sheet metal workers who must fabricate the new underfloor
duct system. In this connection, I again wish to emphasize that
1 asked for drawings of the Type 738 unit in my letter of May 22
and must have this if I am to properly instruct the sheet metal
workers. Any help you may give me in this area will be very much
appreciated.

Sincerely yours,

L Ve
