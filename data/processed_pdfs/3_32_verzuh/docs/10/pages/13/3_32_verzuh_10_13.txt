The Division of Engineering Sciences at Purdue University agreed to
supply the necessary manpower to dismantle the components in which they were
interested. Of course, they also agreed to pay all costs associated with the
transportation of said equipment to Lafayette, Indiana. Accordingly, Profes-
sors Geldmacher, Anderson and Mr. Coon arrived at the Institute on October 7
to assist with this work. Im approximately one week their portion of the
machine had been dismantled and suitably packed and crated for tzmailor ship-
ment to Indiana. :

In connection with the work performed for Purdue University, Professor
‘Geldmacher requested the expenditure of certain labor and materiel expenses.
For example, the salaries of electrical technicians, carpentors, steel cutters,
cost of lumber, etc., were expenses which were authorized with the definite
understanding that Purdue University would reimburse M.X.T. Table II contains
‘ s breakdown of this type of expense and indicates the magnitude of the invoice
