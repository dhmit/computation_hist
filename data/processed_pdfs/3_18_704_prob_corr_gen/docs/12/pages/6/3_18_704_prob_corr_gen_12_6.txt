SUMMARY OF ADVANTAGES

The Company Image Profile is Comprehensive

For' the first time a company can be sure that
all of the traits of its company image are being
evaluated, not just the obvious ones.

The Profile is Flexible

It can be used for any group of people in whom
you are interested—consumers, chain store buy-
ers, tradepaper writers, union members—no mat-
ter who or where the group is, we can obtain a
Profile of their image of your company.

It is Objective

No one influences the results except the people
who are being interviewed. There is no danger of
personal bias entering into the statement of sur-
vey results.

It is Precise

A definite score is obtained for each of the per-
sonality traits. Hard facts replace the broad esti-
mates and general statements of the past.

It Gives Definite Direction to Your Planning

Comparisons between your company image, a
competitor’s company image, and the ideal image
provide concrete direction to your image build-
ing efforts.

It Can be Repeated Later to Measure Change

Changes in company image can be tested in later

years by repeating the same test among the same
type of people.

It is Reasonably Priced

The systematized procedure of the Company
Image Profile permits the accumulation of this

large amount of information at comparatively low
cost.
