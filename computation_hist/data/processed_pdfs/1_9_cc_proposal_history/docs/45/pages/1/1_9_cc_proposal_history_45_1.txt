Professor P. M. Morse
Room 6-109, M.I.T.

Dear Phil:

Yesterday I had an opportunity to talk with

Jim Killian about our needs for a center of
computation with IBM equipment. He asked

whether I thought that rather than appeal to

Mr. Watson for a gift for the Compton Laboratories
it might not be wiser to request support of con-
siderable magnitude for the computational center.

Reluctant as I am to see any funds diverted at
this critical moment from the Compton Memorial,
the importance of the computational center
looms increasingly large in my thoughts. We
agreed, therefore, that tentatively at least we
would plan to approach Mr. Watson - or IBM, or
both - primarily on behalf of the center.

This is simply a progress report to assure you
that things are not wholly dormant, and when
Jim returns from Washington in February I will
undertake to arrange a meeting so that we may
discuss the plan in greater detail.

Sincerely,

â€™
