Brief scientific biography
of/

Problems Which IT ap most interested in are first all connected
with electronic Computer programming ang designing, Lately I took
interest in problems of computer application to business data
Processing,

I was born in Warsaw, 1923, In 1948 T graduated fron the
Gdansk /Dantzig/ Technical University, Department of Electronics.
While stud yi I was 8ppointed ag assistant in mathematics at the

OT 0
I am Director of the Institute of Mathematiog, Machines of the
Polish Academy of Sciences since 1957.

T
American Association for Computing Machinery, I also an dele gate
of Poland to the Internationa] Federation for Information
Processing IFIP,

In 1949 1 started working at the Mathematical Institute,
My first more important Work resulted in the genera) design
02 th

and it hag worked til] 1960.

In 1956 1 guided g group, the taglk of which was to construct
the first Polish electronic digital computer, The Computer wag
accomplished in 1958 and named XYZ, On its basis the ZAM=2 computer
has been build, now being broduced in Poland,

In 1956 1 organized in the Institute of Mathematical Machines
Of the P,ligh Academy of Sciences the first Polish Computation
and Programming Office, using the Xv7 and next the ZAM~2 computer,

In 1988 71 initiated ang Personally conducted work op an
automatic Programming System for Xvy and ZAM-2 computers, This,
when completed in 1961, got the name "SAKO" and it Was such firgt
system elaborated in the 8oclialistie countries, The SAKO language
is in Dany respects similar to the American FORTRAN-TT.

In 1960-62 7 Personally guided a& group designing 8 semiconducty
Computer for data processing ~ ZAM--41, Simultaneously I conducteqd
& group which elaborated gn automatic Programming sygten for ZAM-41,
e optimum fitting of the machine design for the assumeqd Program
ming systems was the problem T especially kept busy with,
