(The notation “dR” and “dT” for experimental errors was necessitated by
i the fact that Whirlwind I cannot print out Greek symbols such as A.)

" The successive approximation method was found to converge in prac-
! tically all cases tried. As was pointed out in section 2, the derivatives of the
optical constants with respect to reflectances and transmission increase
with decreasing ratio of film thickness to wavelength of incident radiation.
This causes the convergence to be slower for infrared radiation than for
visible radiation. In section 4 it is pointed out that very good first estimates
can usually be calculated for the infrared, but not for the visible. The suc-
cessive approximation method has worked successfully in both the visible
and the infrared because in the visible wavelength region convergence IS
sufficiently fast that first estimates do not need to be very good, while in
the infrared the first estimates can be so good that convergence need not
"\be as fast as in the visible.

4. Approximations and first estimates. Harris and Loeb [3] have de-
veloped approximate equations for the optical constants as functions of
tbe‘ observed reflectance and transmission. The assumptions made 1n de-
riving these approximations were that the metal film thickness is very small
(?»Ompared.to the wavelength of the incident radiation, and that t,h;e index
of re.fra,('tlon 18 gpproximately equal to unity. The 2,1(3(?111'acy of the ap-
proximate equatlox.ls was tested on Whirlwind I by (fal('ulat‘ing with the

equations (1) through (7). The agreement between the values of reflectance
and transmission thus found and those observed is a measure of the re-
liability of the approximate equations. The approximate equations were
found to give accurate results for infrared radiation. For visible radiation
they are not usually valid.

While Whirlwind I has been useful for checking the validity of the ap-
proximations, it has proven indispensable for the evaluation of large num-
bers of observations made with visible radiation. Since this evaluation
consists of a series of successive approximations, first estimates of the op-
tical constants must be supplied. Sometimes the optical constants of solid
metals, as reported in the literature, are available to be used as first esti-
mates for the constants of metal films. When such values are not available,
the approximate equations are used to give at least first estimates of the
constants in the visible wavelength region.

In section 2 it was pointed out that the solutions for the optical con-
stants are double valued. The approximate equations developed for the
‘nfrared can be used to obtain first estimates to both sets of optical con-

stants.

5. The Whirlwind computer. The Whirlwind I computer is a high-speed,
parallel-type digital computer with a 16 binary digit register length (equiv-
alent to about 4.5 decimal digits). It is a fixed-point machine (all numbers
lie between —1 and +1), with a single-address order code which includes
the usual arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, di-
vision, etc.) and logical operations such as conditional and unconditional
transfers of control, shifting, extraction, etc. The average time required to
bring one number from the memory, multiply it by another number in the
memory, and transfer the result to memory (which includes the time re-
quired to bring these three instructions from the memory) is 88 micro-
seconds. The high-speed memory (whose access time is about 8 micro-
seconds) consists of 2016 registers of magnetic cores, and both magnetic
drums and tape provide auxiliary storage. Direct output of results is pro-
vided by a Flexowriter* connected to and controlled by the computer. A
faster system for output (in terms of computer time) is provided by storage
of output information on magnetic tape and the later reading and printing
of this information independently of the computer. The fundamental
method of input is from punched paper tapes (in either binary or Flexo-
writer code), and such tapes are normally read into the computer memory

via a photoelectric tape reader.
The restrictions imposed on the program
tions and short numbers of the Whirlwind com

mer by the fixed-point opera-
puter have been removed by
