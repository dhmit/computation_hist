Dear Kr, Jonest

Your letter of Hanuary 8 errived several days ago and we are
very pleased with your whole~heerted cooperation in allowing us %o
participate in the SHARE program. At the present time we do not have
any of the Proceedings of the first three SHARE meetings, and henoe
your letter wae vory weloome since 1¢ clarified a number of points
regarding "requirements and qualifioations™s I have written te
Dr. Greenstadt, iLy¥ Corporation, requesting copies of the Proeeedings.

I am sure you understand that we have not had time to make an
appreciable sontribution to the available 704 assembly and oampiling
prozramse However, as soon as we "catch up", I believe we will be
able to male contributions.

I am looking forw@rd to the San Francisco meeting and the Proceedings
of the fourth EHARE meeting which will be held on February 6 and 10,
respectively. I certainly appreciated resceiving your notices of the

meeting and the enclosed hotel reservation blank, We have discussed
the question of how may people to send to San Fransisco, and decided that
at best we will only send one person since we do not have too much to
eorntribute., However, I expeot this to change, and you will see more
of the staff at the forthooming SHARE meetings.

In closing, I again wish to thank you for your assistance in
getting us on the SHARE progrem.

Sincerely yours,

FP. M. Verzuh
Director
