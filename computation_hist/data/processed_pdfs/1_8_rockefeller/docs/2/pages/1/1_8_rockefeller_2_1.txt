Dear Mr. ﬂunk:

, _ mink nothing of it; we noticed, it but
weren't worried. A3 a matter of fact the basic
trouble was that we got the picture to you at the
last minute, as I remember.

_ ' If there is anything you might need for
the next report, please let me know early, so I
can get it to you well before deadline thie time!

Yours,

Philip M. Morse
