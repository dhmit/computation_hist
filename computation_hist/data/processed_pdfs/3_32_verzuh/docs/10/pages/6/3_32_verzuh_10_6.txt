3. 0 Imm'l'lm! 1m____A__MY UTILIZATION 01' THE RDA

 

The lnstrulentation Laboratory expressed a desire to assune the res-
ponsibility for RDA operation in order that it night carry on design and
.oelihratien studies for new eeepnting sights and a-unitim which were under
current investigation in the Laboratory. Further-ore, certain lnstrnentation
Laboratory contractual oo-itaents were concerned with the developent of in—

proved counting sights, and the solution of associated kins-atic equations
required the use of the m.

The Laboratory felt that the RDA was unique in its demonstrated capability
for handling probleas of that type. It out be numbered that at that tile
(1950) the statu of present—day large-scale ounputers was not where it is at

the present tine, and as a result, these calibration studies could be carried
out nore effectively on the analog lachine.

As it turned out, this was a nest fortunate decision on the part of the
lnstn-entation Laboratory since it resulted in the design of new lead eonputing
sights which were used nest effectively in propeller and jet coebat over Korea.

In this regard, the Differential Analyzer again node a lost valuable contribution
to the war effort.

in the neantine. however, there were continuous runhlings in the background
concerning the reaoval and disposition of the RDA. It was clearly realised that
this aachine was indeed a very old computing nadaine by existing standards. As
a result, late in 1952, inproved types or digital conpnting aachines were obtained
(are. etc.) and certain problens foraerly solved on the Analyzer were trans—
”Wm ierred touthgoigitsl aachines. During this period a deter-ism effort was rude
to evaluate the perforsence a: the Analyzer both on an economic and engineering‘ '
basis. As the perforasuce of the whirlwind Computer improved and sore inter—
pretive subroutines, converaion programs, floating decinal subroutines, etc. were
nade available, it home increasingly apparent that 3 larger and larger portion
of the work done on the Differentill Analyser could be handled on the digital
equipent. Furthermore, as the RDA increased in age its nintauanee costs
naturally increased. and since the digital facilities had definitely becone part

of the 11.1.1. computational program it became apparent that serious consideration
should be given-to the removal of the RDA.

4.0 SURVEY 0? THE APPLICATION OF THE DIFFEIBNTIAL ANALYZER

 

 

In retrospect, it is of interest to point out sons of the principal
contributions made by the Analyzer during its 12-year life at MJJ‘. If
lust be renuhered, of course, that its early applications were strongly in—
fluenced by World War 11. Specifically, the machine was conpleted in 1942, and
since the applications during the period 1942-1945 were almost entirely of a

unitary character. the 210110571233 types of probleas were solved (in none cases
thousands of tines):
