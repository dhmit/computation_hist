Dear Dr. Griswold:

I am pleased to enclose a check for $1, 725. 00 for the second
semester portion of the Yale University appointments to the M.I. T.
Computation Center as described on the attached sheet. The IBM
Corporation is very grateful for the work of the Research Associates
and Assistants in the program, for they have contributed a great deal to
ite success.

There are now thirty-four colleges and universities in New
England participating with M.I1.T. in the Computation Center. The new
IBM 709 has been in operation for four months, and already seventeen of
the colleges have made use of it. For your information, I am enclosing
a table of usagefor the months September - December, 1960.

Sincerely yours,
