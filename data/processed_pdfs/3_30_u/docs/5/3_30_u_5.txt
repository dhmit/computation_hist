Dear Phil:

Please find enclosed a letter which I have received upon

my return here from Professor fukaszewicz (whom, I believe,
T mentioned to you during our breakfast in Philadelphia).
As you will see, he is a knowledgeable person. I had a
letter before from Professor Kuratowski about him, asking
me to find out where a visit by tukaszewicz would be pos-
sible. Kuratowski is an old Professor of mine. He is now
Director of the Polish Mathematics Institute and a Vice-
President of the Polish Academy of Science. He thinks very
highly of Lukaszewicz.

[ enjoyed our short encounter among the philosophers and es-
pecially your very elegant and comprehensive talk. - I hope
je can get together soon to discuss the universe in more de-
tail! Any chance of seeing you here, if you happen to plan
any trips West? I would be delighted if you could give a
talk here or: just spend a day or two in los Alamos.

With best regards and greetings,
Yours, as ever,

7 ti.

S. M.-Ulafi.
