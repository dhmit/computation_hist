In accordance with our discussions regarding the proposal to K83, ‘
i am enclosing the following intonation.

 

 

 

Machine cylonont 93. Lbs ILLT. mutation Center

The ILLT. Computation Center will have a Type 704 Electronic
Data Processing lachine with the following machine complement:
12 magnetic tape units, 2 magnetic cons storage units containing a
total of 8, 000 words, 1 magnetic drum unit containing 4, 000 words
of storage, the usual on-line punched card reader, alphabetic printer,
and punched cord recorder as ~well as the 3 o__ff—l_ine magnetic tape
controlled printer, magnetic tape controlled —card punch, and punched
oard-to-magmtic tape converter, respectively. Total machine
complement net monthly- rental is slightly over $45,000. In addition

to the 704, there will be 10 auxiliary punched card machines including

L' Q card punches, collstors, sorters, reproducers, interpreters, and the

Type 407 Accounting Machine. The aggregate machine rental is in
excess of 3 50,000 per month.

 

The Type 704 EDP! unit is one of the fastest large-scale
commercial computers available today. Since the ILLT. installation
will be but one of many in the field, techniques, programs, and
numerical procedures developed for this machine will he of universal use.

Biographical Information

Dr. F. l. Verzuh, Director of Statistical Services, has been
connected with the operation of ILLT. computational work since 1940.
In this capacity he has had considerable experience with the utilization
of. various analog computing equipment -- differential analyzers, etc.,
as well as a complete line of digital machines ranging from the IBM
Type 601 through the Type 704.

 

He received a. 3.8. degree in Electrical Engineering from the
University of Denver in 1940, a ILS. degree in Electrical Engineering

from 21.1.1 in 1946, and a Son. degree in Electrical Engineeng from
ELLT. in 1952.
