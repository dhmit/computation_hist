_ather ample neighbourhood of t.he critical .Valu.es 00, 0 0).- But every lattice
is equivalent under change of basis to one l.ymg in this neighbourhood, by an
extension of Gauss’s criterion for reduction, i.e., that one root a..nd the negative
reciprocal of its conjugate lie between 0 and 1. Thus the lattice &, is critical.

If we turn our attention to the definite form ¢ = x:®> + x,* we find that ¢
is stable only for the critical (equilateral) lattice, in which case ¢ is proportional
under rotation, to the norm function of the integers in the field of the cube roots
of unity. For the larger problem of ¢ = x:2 + ... + x,°, analogous types of
extrema have been developed [6; 9; 2] manifesting themselves largely in the
coefficients of the expanded form. (The reader is referred to [2] for recent develop-
ments as well as a sizable bibliography.) The present paper, however, will
conclude with a treatment of the norm function of §7 as a factored form; thus we
shall finally arrive at a criterion of stability in terms of the multiplicative arith-
metic of a field.

9. Application of units of the order. The module I determines [5] another
(non-singular) module O, called its order, which consists of all algebraic integers
v (in the corresponding field) such that VI lies in M. For instance, if M were
the module of all integers in a field (called an integer-module for short), then we
should have © = I and the minimizing x (or z) satisfying equations (7.1)
(or (7.2)) would be the units. In any case, £ is also a ring with unity, and
according to the classical theory it contains 7 4+ s — | fundamental units.
We shall denote any unit by u (with conjugates #;). Thus for every solution X
(orz) to.(7.1) (or (7.11)) another one is of the type xu (or zu). We shall now st
these units to make the vectors R follow a unit star. (See §6.)

The norm 1n a totally real module is therefore stable
x of minimal absolute norm ( 7 0) are such that, for
fields denoted by | and j, the ratio x,/x, is positive for so

if and only if the numbers

me X and negative for others.

As an 1mmec'11ate consequence of .this criterion, the integer-module of a req;
quadratic field is stable if and only if there is a unit of norm —1. The inte
module of a fotally real cubic field is stable if and only if the un.its disp]a;gzlii
possible 2° arrays of sign among their conjugates. For instance the totally real
cubic field generated by 2 cos 27 /7 (of minimal discriminant = 49) easily has the
property, as we see by using as units conjugates of this generating element.
Hence the field in question is stable [7].

[n the case of modules which are not totally real it is harder to find a criterion
as elegant as the last one, because Iu /U jl = [uq/u,,l not only when j and / refer
to tzhe same fields (respectively) as do p and ¢, but also when they refer to
conjugate complex fields. Thus it is not so easy to accentuate just one component
of R. But since we are interested in the real or imaginary components of u,/u,
(see (7.21)), we can make use of the incommensurability of = with the arguments
gf certain complex units. Thus by a modification of the unit star method as
Just used for the totally real case, we can see that all cubic fields that are not
oially real have integer-modules with stable norms. Mahler [7] gave an analogous
result only for the cubic field of (minimal) discriminant 23, but it curiously
tnough requires no special properties of that field!

Concluding in a simpler vein, we can see that if an integer-module is not
totally real, but nevertheless has as units only totally real numbers (OI: Sl
Pure imaginary numbers) then it can not be stable, as the number of distinct
10n-zero components in (7.21) will fall short of the desired total, Q = n(n — 1),
.hy at least 5. Thus, once more, the complex quadratic fields do not have stable
"teger-modules, except when the field is that of the cube roots ol unity.
