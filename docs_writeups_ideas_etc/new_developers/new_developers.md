### Continuing Members

We're moving from a model where everyone has a fork of the main 
repository to one where we work with different branches on the main
repository. (The following instructions are weird.)

1. Post a hello in the general slack channel including your 
github user name

1. Delete the folder that contains your computation_hist repository

1. GitHub Desktop will ask you if you want to clone or remove the repo. Select remove.

1. Add the dhmit/computation_hist repo on GitHub Desktop
