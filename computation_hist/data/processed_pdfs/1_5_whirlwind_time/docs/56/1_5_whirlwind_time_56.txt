Dear Sir:

I have been authorized to credit your account
with 3 hours of machine time on the Whirlwind I computer
for work under problem 368 which is concerned with film
condensation in a vertical tube subject to varying vapor
velocity.

If you find that you need more time, it will
be necessary to submit a mew request.

Sincerely,

F. M, Veosuh
