M.I.T. Computation Growth Page 4.

All of these seemingly disparate areas have very much
in common. First of all, they no longer are primarily com-
putational in nature. In general, they all have a very
large information processing and retrieval aspect. That 1s
to say that they all require almost a random access to a
huge amount of information and spend much time in reorganlz-
ing that information. The penalty for lesser access times
and smaller core memory i1g an inordinate cost in machine
time. Secondly, these areas are all polnting in the direc-
tion of not only computing an answer, but in repeating the
process many times in order to galn a best answer and
eventually toward gaining an insight into why it 1s the best
answer. Clearly, a large number of small machines cannot
snswer this need. What 1s needed is a very large capacity,
high speed computer that has large information processing
capebilities and can be time shared, 1. â‚¬. multiprogrammed
such as a stretch class computer. The atretch has not only
far greater memory and computational speed than a TO4, but
in addition, is a far more efficient information progessor
than the 704 which was designed to handle only numbers, and
1s quite poor at finding, or rearranging information.

Let us examine a few of the research areas that are
currently hampered, and whose future growth 1s out of the
guestion unless the general capacity that we have discussed
is provided.

Weather Forecas ting-Professor Charney

Weather prediction for a hemlsphere of earth, using a
very rough model takes on the order of 24 hours of TO4 tiume
for a 24 hour prediction. The reason for this 1s that the
model must take into account topographlcal features, heat
balances, moisture contents, etc. at many many points, both
at and above the earth's surface. Long range forecasting is
ghus clearly impossible on the TO4. As a result, progress
in this area must remain slow until a faster machine is
avallable.
