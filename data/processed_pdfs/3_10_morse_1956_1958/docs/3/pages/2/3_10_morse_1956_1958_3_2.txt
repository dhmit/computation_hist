However, for the excited states as e.g. the lowest triplet level
which Dr. Szent-Gyorgyi thinks is most important for biology, we will
have to apply more sophisticated methods, using self-consistent molecu-
1ar orbitals and configuration interaction as Dr. Pariser has done
recently for some simpler molecules. Dr. Pariser, who is at the Jackson
Laboratory of E. I. duPont de Nemours and Company in Wilmington, Delaware,
is very much interested in the sbove-mentioned applications. However,
these applications can only be made with the use of digital computers,
which is the reason I am looking for computational facilities and I wonder
if there is a possibility at M.I.T.

Looking forward to your answer,
Very sincerely yours,
