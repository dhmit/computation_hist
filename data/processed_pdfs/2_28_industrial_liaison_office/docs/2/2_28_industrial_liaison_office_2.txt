INDUSTRIAL LIAISON OFFICE

CAMBRIDGE 39, MASS.

21 August 1958

Professor P. M. Morse
Director, Computation Center
Room 26-142

Dear Phil:

As you know, the Industrial Liaison Office mainteins a tally of
visits we arrange with faculty and staff members for representatives of
the companies participating in the Program. Inevitably, certain people
receive more visitors than others, in spite of our efforts to spread
this activity. We try to make these visits professionally rewarding and
desirable from the staff standpoint. At the same time, those who enter-
tain visitors are helping the Liaison Program in a very important way
and those of us who are responsible for monitoring the Institute's com-
mitments under the Liaison Program appreciate very much this essential
help.

According to our records for fiscal year 1957-58, Dr. F. M. Verzuh
had a total of seven visits arranged through this Office. We appreciate
this cooperation very much. I want to assure you again of our diligence
in seeking to deflect trivial visits away from busy people, and I be-
speak the continued cooperation of the Computation Center in receiving
visitors whenever in the judgment of one of the Liaison Officers such a
visit is called for.

Sincerely,
William R. Weems, Director
Industrial Liaison Office
