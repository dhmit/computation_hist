History of Computation at MIT, 1950-62

From first looks in the 1950s, America was very much involved in conflict around the world. This 
lead to scientists going to extremes to beat their opponents. While no directly connected to 
computation one can look at the large list of human experiments that was carried out in this time. Edgewood Arsenal human experiments tested a variety of chemicals on soldiers to see what the 
effects would be. 
This includes.
* Anticholinesterase nerve agents (VX, sarin, and common organophosphorus (OP) and carbamate 
pesticides)
* Mustard agents
* Nerve agent antidotes including atropine and scopolamine
* Nerve agent reactivators, e.g. the common OP antidote 2-PAM chloride
* Psychoactive agents including LSD, PCP, cannabinoids, and BZ
* Irritants and riot control agents
* Alcohol and caffeine

A continued need for science in the war effort led to the formation of the IDA in April of 1956. 
This was a nonprofit research institute designed to attract scientists to create things that 
could be used for war. This effort was lead by James R. Killian who was an advisor to the Dwight 
Eisenhower Administration.

[The obiturary of James Killian](From <http://articles.latimes

 effort. James Killian was the president of MIT from 1949 to 1959 and in this time he also had a 
 role in government helping with the war effort. He was the first White House Science Advisor 
 while working with President Eisenhower, and later worked with President Kennedy after the Bay 
 of Pigs incident. Killian led organisations that worked with Polari and the U-2 spy plane. He 
 also helped in the establishment of NASA [https://www.nasa

The IDA worked with Weapons Systems Evaluation Group (WSEG) which had the aim of uniting 
scientists with arms.
 
The IDA and universities ended their close ties after demonstrations due to the Vietnamm war on 
college campuses.
