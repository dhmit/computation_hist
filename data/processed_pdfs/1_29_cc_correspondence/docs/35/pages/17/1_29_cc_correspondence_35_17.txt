D. Machine Language Programs to be Run with

Compatibility Package

The 709 may be run in a Compatibillty Mode for
the purpose of running 704 programs that only occupy the
lower half of core (i.e. 16,384 cells).  The compatibility
program, which occuples the upper half of core memory, assumes
all responsibility for input and output and simulates the 4
logical drums 1if they are not present on the 709. This
simulation may be somewhat 1néfficient in €ime.

L Only 2 control cards need be added to the binary

deck. The tape assignments are specified by the control
card; standard control cards will be available at the Center.

The Compatibility'Program, IBIOC2, is described in
SHARE Distribution No. 682 and the method in the IBM 709 Data
Processing System Bulletin, "704-709 Input/Ouput Compatibility .
Program - Compatibility II, (Form J-28-6039)".

E. Other Programs for Assisting the 704 to 709 Transition

The following three programs have not been tried

by the Center but are brought to your attention:
1. RL L349 (Share Dist. No. 678)
"A binary editor for programmed 704-709
Compatibility" for use on the 709,
Properties: a) Reads object program as
.absolute binary cards only and object program
cannot use trap mode.

b) Editor uses 10,0008 locations and 4000g
for each logical drum.

c) Debugging features are included in Editor
which give machine conditions and requests
that are omn control cards (of the NYDS1 type).

An advantage is that the editor will operate in
conjunction with the SOS system.
