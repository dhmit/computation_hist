Dear Manny:

I am enclosing a short note on the modification of the IBM 704
which we would like to put into effect, The memo indicates some of the
many interesting applications which can be worked on if the modification
can be done, We had thought originally of making the machine modification
ourselves but we are a little hesitant about getting into the machine and
possibly holding up operation for a while, We now understand that the
modification we desire has been made a standard one which is available to
the 704 customers upon appropriate payment,

I should think that the standard IBM modificéition would be the
desirable way of making this change but the standard IBM price is out of
our reach, I hesitate to ask DeCarlo's division to 0.KE., the donation
since it is more for research than it is for purely educational uses (if
you can ever separate these two), At any rate, if you feel this would be
a2 desirable thing, for us to have your support of our request, through
Shader to DeCarlo, it would be welcomed, The reason we feel urgent about
it is that a couple of the researchers who would like to use this device
are Ph,D, theses and, if we have no hope of making the modification soon,
the graduate students will make their part of the equipment £it some
other machine which will reduce our flexibility later,

You have probably heard that our joint conference will be held
on Friday, December 20, We hope you can come here that day, If you do,
we can talk to you further about this matter,

Yours,

Philip M, Morse
Director
