<p>How much does it cost to run a computer? And who gets access to this limited resource? In the
    1950s, it cost as much as $250 to purchase one hour of compute time on MIT’s Whirlwind I.
    Adjusted for inflation in 2019, that’s almost $2400. In other words, for one hour of Whirlwind
    time, you can now buy a very expensive laptop with over 1.2 million times more computing power.</p>

    With the Whirlwind I, MIT was figuring out not just how to use computers but also how to
    distribute and manage time among dozens of researchers. On one hand, MIT’s accounting of
    computer usage was extremely meticulous. Whirlwind use for each individual project was tracked
    and billed by the second. Researchers regularly received letters informing them how many
    minutes they had used. On the other hand, they struggled with how to allocate
    computer time evenly for everyone. Take the case of <a href="/archives/person/jack-l-uretsky">Jack L. Uretsky</a>.
    In 1955, Uretsky was a physics
    Ph.D. student working on a thesis titled “Scattering of Zero-Energy Neutrons by a Spheroidal
    Square Well.” MIT had allocated a total of 5,929.6 minutes for the lab of which he was part.
    Of this time allotment, Uretsky alone used over 64% of the minutes. This case reflects a
    common theme among <a href="/archives/doc/1_9_cc_proposal_history_15">the given time
    records</a>. It seems that many researchers, while they understood the potential of Whirlwind
    I’s computational power, were not sure how to apply it. Writing up a program to solve problems
    was time-consuming, and people who considered using the computer had to decide if it was
    worth the time to write out the program or just to do calculations by hand. This dilemma gave rise to a
    new rule for using Whirlwind I, the “<a href="/archives/story/debugging">three man-months</a>”.
    Philip Morse, Director of the Computation Center, suggested it was only worth using
    a computer if calculation by hand would take more than three man-months.
    Uretsky, it seems, took advantage of other people’s hesitance to use the allocated computer
    time for his own project.</p>
<p>
    It was only towards the end of this thesis research that Frank Verzuh, the Assistant Director of
    the Computation Center, who kept track of the time records, realized Uretsky's project
    had become "quite expensive." Over the previous 14 months, he had used up $18,132.70. This comes
    out to around $191,260.11 in 2019 dollars! Luckily, Uretsky did not have to pay that amount. MIT had given each
    lab a certain amount of computer time. The $250 "regular rate,"
    Verzuh informed him in <a href="/archives/doc/1_5_whirlwind_time_77">a letter,</a> didn't
    apply in his case.
    Being a graduate student at MIT has always had its perks. In the 1950s, for a lucky few, access
    to supercomputers was one of them.
