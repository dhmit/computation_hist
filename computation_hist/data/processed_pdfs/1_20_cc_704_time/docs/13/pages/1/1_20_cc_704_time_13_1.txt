Memorandum To: Professor G.S. Brown
From: Dr. A.L. Leeb

Subject: Appointment of PM. ﬂier-some to the 13.8.3. 7007 Project
to Apply the IBM 70!. to the Problem of Electrophoresis

Date: 19 October 1956

P). Viersene is a graduate student in Professor J. Th. 0. Overbeek's
Laboratory at the University of Utrecht, working on the phenomenon of
colloid eleein-ophoreaie. The first phase of the computations will be
completed by the end of 1956, having been programmed and coded for. and run
of the All“ computer in Amsterdam, perti‘elly under the supervision of
A.‘ . Loob. The subsequent phase of the calculations requires a machine
considerably more sophisticated then the AREA. and it is proposed that
the IBM 704. to be installed at 11.1.13. be applied to the problem

Viol-sens will take his Doctor's qualifying examinations in
December 1956, and will continue on the electrophoresis problem for his
doctoral thesis with Professor Overbeek, who has enthusiastically endorsed
Vienna's spending a year at 14.1.1. to acquaint himself with the IBM 704
computer. Professor Morse has indicated that computer time will he reads
available for the project. since Niel-same does not need academic credits
from M.I.’l‘., a straight D.S.R. appoint-at would appear most logical.
Lincoln Personnel has not offered any objection to having a foreign
citieen on 13.5.8. 700'} as long as the work is performed outside the
Lincoln Laboratory. A.L. Lceb is very glad to supervise and participate

in this research, which is of great fundamental interest, and recommends
ﬂier-sens so a very capable and conscientious worker.
