Phase 3, stems Des and ification, By this stage, hopefully

2 clear picture will have emerged both with regards to needs and
possible ways of meeting these needs, The group will them go on to

the crux of the task, namely to the specification of the desired system,
in terms of its type, administration, and role at MIT (or if it should
prove desirable, its larger role with respect to the area), The study
should also attempt to determine what areas deserve future research in
computer usage and computer system design,

Time-Table

Â¥hile it is too early to specify exact dates, it is presently
planned that the group should spend the remaining part of the spring
term in getting organized, the summer for phase 1, and be prepared to
submit a final report by early fall of 1860,

Organization and Support

It is clear that responsibility (and suthority) should rest
totally upon the chairman of this group, and that the Institute should
back up this position with an expression of support at the highest level;
otherwise, it may prove impossible to collect all the needed facts, It
is further clear that this group will need the participation of a widely
representative group at the Institute, both in terms of guidance and in
terms of detailed knowledge,

it is therefore suggested that the following people be assigned
to this group:

 

 

a) Senior Consultants: Prof, Morse
Prof, Fano
Prof, Hill
Prof, Wiener
Prof, Wiesner

b) VWorking Panel Members (fractiomal time):

Dr, Phyllis Fox Computation Center, full time

Prof, McCarthy E.E, and Artificial Intelligence
Prof, Minsky Math, and Artificial Intelligence
Prof, Howard E,E,, Op, Research, Teaching

Dr, Corbato Physics, Computation Center

Prof, Arthurs E.E,, Information Retrieval

Prof, Arden E.E,, Automata

Prof, Susskind E,BE,, Computer Design

Mr, Wesley Clark Lincoln, Neurological Computer Usage
Dr, Eent Hansen Nuclear

Dr, Michael Barnett Physice, Programming Systems
Dr, Daniel Goldenberger Instrumentation, Computer Systems
Prof, Charney Meteorological
