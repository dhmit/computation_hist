DNEXT Solve matrix equation A x < b', when 4 x = b has been solved by MIDPME.

1. This routine provides a ,.'larqlgda saving in time when solving for a2 new
fight-hand side. Calling aéquénc? ig same as for MIDPME except that X
must contain TSY DNEXT,k. I,:'Rem’xltlb, error stops, etc. are £ll the same

as UIDRE. ; \ |
o  WIDPYE writes five records on MT-NINE: O, 4, D, M, I - A, D is the
first 6n instructions of MIDME, tﬁe other letters are explained in the

nain writeup. Upon exit from WIDME, MT-NINE is positioned to read A as
‘the next record. This is for convenience of user, who may want to read

in A by BLINS; the necessary CAD checksum is stored in SuCKA,

DNEXT spaces down to M and reads it into memory to form Mb'. It then

 

 

reads in I - liA and starts iterating. The parts of MIDPHE that form M and
check I - AM are skipped, thus saving considerable time. DNEXT restores
C on exit, but since it uses the block written by HIDPME, changes in C
between use of MIDPME and DNEXT will be lost.
