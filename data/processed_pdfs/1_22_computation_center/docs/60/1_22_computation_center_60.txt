Dear Professor Morse:

This is the promised confirmation that Dr. Arthur Grad and I
should very much like to visit the MIT Computation Center on
Thursday, 21 Feburary, for the purpose of discussing current and
future research plans with some of its key members, Flanning to
come up on the Federal the night of the 20th, we could spend the
early morning hour at the ONR Branch Office and would count on
meeting you in your office at 10.00 a.m. s==provided this time is
convenient for you.

If not, it would probably be simplest if you could leave word
with Dre Muckenhoupt how you would like to have us routed,

Looking forward to the occasion, with best regards.
Sincerely yours,
F. JOACHIM WEYL, Director S
Mathematical Sciences Diyision
