Dear Professor Verzuh:

This is to confirm our conversation of yesterday concerning the
special devices being ordered for the 704. If you will refer to my letters of
August 9, 1956 and September 25, 1956, they enumerate all the special de-
vices which have been considered for the 704.

I have now been informed that the instruction Back Space Fileis
still being engineered and we do not have any estimate of when it will be
available for installation. The instruction for Modification of Read-Write
Check is still under discussion as a result of the last Share meeting and there
is no definite decision on the availability of this. The two modifications for
Overflow Indicators and Floating Point Trap have been revised in terms of a
newly announced feature called Floating Point Tra Device and this device
has been ordered and should be available by August 1957.

The Ribbon Inking Device is not particularly essential for operation

of the 704. This is also being re-engineered and may be available at some
later date.

To the best of my knowledge all other devices are either on the 704

at this time or will be installed when the machine is physically installed at
MIT in April,

Sincerely yours,
