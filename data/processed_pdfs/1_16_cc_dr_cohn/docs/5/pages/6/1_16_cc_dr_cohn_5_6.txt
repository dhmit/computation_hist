To obtain from this boundary a finite obstacle resembling an airplane, symmetrically
terminate the wing, as in Fig. 3, at a trailing edge which is supersonic with respect to the
uniform flows adjacent to both sides of the wing. On the lower side there will be an ex-
pansion around the trailing edges. The flow field just described will be unaffected up to
the first Mach surface in the expansion fan emanating from the trailing edges. In par-
ticular, the leading edge shock will cease to be plane at its intersection with this surface.
On the upper side there will be a shock attached to the trailing edges, ahead of which

the original flow will be unaltered. If the trailing edges are straight, as in I'ig. 3, the
shock and immediately following flow for either half of the wing will be conical with
respect to the corresponding wing tip. Possible trailing edges for the fin would be its
intersections with the trailing edge shocks. If a thick wing is desired, the upper surfaces
need not be parallel to the lower surfaces. Finally the upper surfaces need not even be
plane, but may be cylindrical or even conical, with vertices at the wing tips. However,
after such changes the simple wave flows cease to be conical with respect to the origin.

of the first paragraph of Section 3. Examination of Fig. 1 shows that cross sections by
the planes z = =+ 1 would have the appearances of Figs. 4 and 5. Â£z and E are traces
