This meeting continued the discusslion of applicants for
agssistantships for next year. DMorse reported that a discussion
with Mr. Foster of D.I.C, indicated that as many as a total of
twenty assistantships could bz awarded next year. Consequently,
the limitation is not on account of budget, but should only be
on the excellence of the applicants. Morse reported that O'Donnell
of the Chemical Engineering Department had accepted his assistant-
ship for next year and that Duren, Rotenberg and Combelic have also
accepted. He reported that Mr. Leibowitz, when asked, had indicated
that he preferred to be a teaching fellow rather than a research
assistant in machine calculation. It was decided by the Committee
that Ruth Seiwatz and J. Uretsky should be appointed for next year
and that Haun should be approached to see whether he were interested
in sueh an assistantshilp.

Reissner reported that Ralston and Aronson had sccepted,
Martino had not been heard from as yet. It wae decided to appoint
Glantz in addition,

Forrester reported that Wilkes of Manchester University
has an assistant in his group who is interested in visiting the
Institute during the summer and wonders whether we could pay him
‘for his stay here. This seemed acceptable to the Committee, and
Forrester was requested to obtain detalls from Wilkes 80 that we
could make arrangements for the appointment.

It was decided that at the next meeting on April 2,
we would ask Professor Hildebrand to meet with us to discuss the
course in Numerical Analysis which he will give next fall.
