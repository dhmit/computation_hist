Since a research end treining pfogaxa mist be closgoly linked with
other faculbty activities, it is proposed that supervisiocn of thisg pari of
the progrem be underitaken by the recently created Center for Machine Compu-
tation. The interdepartmental Advisory Commitiee to this Center provides
a broad repregsentation of the various scientific, engineeriag and training
activities likely to bs involved. ‘ ‘

The program which ONR might wish to support can be divided inbo
four sections::

1. Research in methods of numerical esnalysis and the forrm-
lation of scientific problems for machine solution, together wvith support
of training of students in these methoda.

2. BSupport of the sclentific and engineering applications
group previocusly referred to with Project VWhirlwind so as to make the
¥¥W computer useful and available for the asbove research, and an aid to
the research being carried on by MIT faculty and students.

3. A partial support of the maintenance of the WW computer.

4L+ Ressarch on and investigation of digital computing machine
components.

It is understood that details of the program, which is neces~
serﬂ;y evolutionary in character, will be worked ocut from time to time with
the Scientific Officer of the ONR.

It is contemplated that $300,000 per annum for a period of at
least two years will be required to get this program under way. Detall
of the budget is as followss

Item 1 £100,000
Item 2 100,000
Item 3 . 50,000
Tten 4 50,000

The detalled budget for each of the items may run approximately

as followss
