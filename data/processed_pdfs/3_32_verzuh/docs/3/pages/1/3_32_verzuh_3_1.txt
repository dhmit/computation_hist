describes work which we have performed on the M, 1. T,

it actually bears another Alr Force Contract number. This
was necessary because the costs of the operation of the
Anaj yzer are bheing supported by this latter contract. Since
this work is described In our (umarterly Progress Report

{(page 10 and reference 6}, I felt it advisacle to send copies
for your use,
