SURVEY OF M. I. T. COMPUTING MACHINES

INTRODUCTION:

At present there exist within the Institute many computing
machines of varying complexities, While this is not surprising
in view of the ever-growing need for computational facilities
in research, it appears that by and large these facilities are not
being fully utilized by the staff and student body of the Insti-
tute. It was with this state of affairs in mind that the
Committee on Machine Methods of Computation was formed to
"survey this situation, find whether the machines could be
integrated more closely with the main Institute activities,
training, and open research, and to implement this integration."

As one of the steps in implementing this program, a survey
has been made of the various cmputing machine facilities, both
large and small, which are in use today at the Institute. This
is the subject of the following report.

It has been found more convenient to discuss the machine
facilities by department. For one thing, a better view is
thereby obtained of the use to which the machines are being
put. For an over-all view, however, we have included in Table I
a list of all the machines reported on herein. There is one
reservation to this remark. Some of the machines have speclal
additions designed for solutions of problems arising in con-
nection with particular physical systems, e.g., the Flight
Table which simulates the motion of aircraft. By themselves,

they are not computing devices and 80 are not included in Table I,


De
although their connection with particular machines 1s discussed
in the body of the report.

In Table I it will be seen that machines are typed as to
whether they are digital or analog and a word should be said
about this classification. The digital machines actually
carry out the numerical operations such as addition and multi-
plication by counting. An example of such a machine would be
the ordinary desk-size calculator. The analog devices, on the
‘other hand, measure rather than count. A physical device such
a8 a mechanical or electrical system 1s used to reprasent the
problem, with variables being represented by lengths, voltages,
ete. A simple example of such a device is a slide rule. It
may be mentioned that the digital type 1s in principle more
precise, since the upper limit of its precision is determined by
the number of digits it can handle. The precision of analog
devices, however, is limited in principle by the precision of
its fabricated parts.

Table I includes the name of the department in which the
particular machine is used. The listing may also be used to
find where in the body of the report a fuller discussion of
the machine will be found. In connection with the department,
there is listed the name of the person to be seen about the use
of the particular machine.

Of the analog devices contalned in Table I, five of
them are what may be called large-scale machines. These are,
consequently, of somewhat greater interest and in Table II

will be found a concise synopsis of the capabllities of these


wie

machines. This table is taken from a report bY F. M. Verzuh.*
Aside from the computing machines, there are a number of

organized groups of computing personnel in existence which

have varying numbers of desk-size computing machines {mostly

Marchant and Friden types) and computers. These are tabulated

in Table III along with the person in charge. They are also

discussed in the report.

A number of departments make use of high-speed, all-
electronic analog computers built by the Philbrick Research
Corporation. Mathematically speaking, these machines solve
sets of total differential equations, both linear and non-
linear. Under certain conditions of similitude, systems
governed by partial differential equations may often be handled,
but normally, time 1s the only independent variable. These
are avallable in the following three groups: Instrument Section
of the Aeronautical Department, Hydrodynamics Laboratory, and
the Acoustics Laboratory. The machines are all similar and,
in fact, the parts are interchangeable. Many components can

be added or borrowed from one machine to another in order to

 

solve more complicated equations. The discussion of the machine

in the Instrument Section illustrates its general use.

Instrument Section of the Aeronautical Department. The
machine is used to solve ordinary differential equations which
arise in connection with instrumentation problems. At{ present,

7 integrators are avallable. The time constant of the integrators
1s 0.4 milli-seconds (2 with T_ = 0.0004 seconds) which permits
solutions to be flashed almost instantaneously on an oscilloscope.
For many problems, it is desired to find regions of stable oscll-
lations. Since the parameters of the problem may be varied merely
by turning some dials, it is clear that a large class of solutlons
may be investigated in a fairly short time. Furthermore, it takes

very little experience to operate the machine.

Additional units include a multiplier component to find

e concerned With the development of new types of

machines than
with their use.

The Macnee electronic differential analyser
oo =o Ioilerential analyser

was built with the view in mina of constructing a differential

analyser which would be relatively inexpensive, but at the same

time would have moderate accuracy, high speed of Operation,

ability to handle aij types of ordinary differential equations,
and flexibility to permit the rapid investigation of wide ranges
of equation parameters ang Initial conditions. This machine has
81x integrators, an arbitrary-function generator, and a high-
Speed multiplier. It is capable of handling ordinary differen-
tial equations, linear and non-linear, with constant opr variable
coefficients. It can handle up to five simultaneous first-order
ordinary differential equations, or single ones up to the sixth
order. The machine flashes solutions every 1/60th of a secnnd.
The accuracy displayed is from 1 to 5%.

In addition, a High Speed Product Integrator has been
developed which is made up of electronic differential analyser
components and a set of motor-driven potentiometers. With this,
it 1s possible to solve interral equations of the form

b or x
F(y) 5 £(x) K(x,y)dx

a

where f(x) and K(x,y) are known functions.

A one-hundred point solution is obtained every 1.67 seconds
and the solutions are displayed on a cathode ray tube screen.
Evaluation of the solutions of the Fourier, Schl8milch, and
superposition integral equations has bezn considered. In the
worst cases, the error had a maximum value of 10%, but for

. ,
most cases the observed error was of the order of 2%.

~The following machines have also been built at Research
~ Laboratory of Electronics:

(1) A Network Synthesis Device which solves the approximation
problem of network synthesis. Mathematically speaking, the

 

machine solves Poisson's equation.

(2) An Electronic Isograph which finds the roots of ‘polynomials
up to the sixth order.
(3) A Device for Solving 5 Simultaneous Algebraic Equations
by the method of steepest descent. This machine uses inte-
grators and is applicable only for positive definite matrices.
(4) A Digital Electronic Corrslator has been built which is
designed to compute correlation functions. The input equipment
obtains samples of the amplitude of the continuous signal inputs
and converts each sample to a 10-digit binary number. The digital
nature of the machine allows for high accuracy to be obtained
(of the order of 1%). An additional unit, providing static
magnetic storage for 100 of the 10-digit binary numbers, 1s
under construction.
(5) An Analog Electronic Correlator is a recent addition to R.L.E.
This device works on the seme principle as the previously mentioned
one, but is simpler and smaller, in fact, portable. In order to
achieve flexibility, there has been some sacrifice in frequency
range (500 eycles - 100 kiloecycles). The accuracy is of the
order of 5%.

(6) A machine for computing probability distributions. This
machine makes two counts, determining whether a given event

happens or not. More precisely, if samples a given wave and


ET i ——— i ——
— _—

 

 

 

“Yh
counts how many times the amplitude falls within a glven interval.
The machine can also be arranged to make counts for conditional
probabilities. |

I+ should be mentioned that machines (1), (2), and (3) are
all analog devices, essentlally electronic, and the accuracy
obtainable is of the order f 1% to 5%.

Also under construction is a machine for solving integral
equations. This will have input and output units which will
JIE information (iterations, say) digitally on punched tape
although it will be an anaiog device.

A 5-channel analog correlator 1s also being built under the

supervision of Professor Reint jes.

Dynamic Analysis and Control Laboratory. This laboratory
designed, constructed, and now operates a large-scale analog com-
puting machine called the B.L.T. Fiight Simulator. The major
application of the Strulater is in the solution of probiems asso-
clated with the flight of airborne vehicles. It is composed of
the following two main parts:

(1) A Three-Dimensional Flight Table which is capable of simu-
lating the angular motions of an alrecraft about a point of

space. Provision is made for mounting some actual flight-
contrcl components on the table. The table with an assoclated
aerndynamic computing section forms a complete computing facillty
in which the motions of the table are controlled on an accelera-
tion servo basis.

(2) A Generalized Computer particularly adapted for solving non-

linear ordinary differential eguatlons with time-varying coef-


; ~15~
ficients. The machine employs a 400-cps suppressed-carrier voltage
as the data carrier, has a variable time scale, and can handle
a great many parameters, It has 14 electromechanical integrators
each with 5 output units so that, for example, the valuss of x,
x°, x3, 2; and x2 can be obtained from a single unit. If re-
solvers rather than potentiometers are used as output units,
linear combinations of sines and cosines of the integral of the
input can be obtained. The machine has a number of summing
circuits, coefficient potentiometers, and 3 high-speed multi-
pliers. Each component has an accuracy of 0.1% of full Scale.
The output recording equipment consists of Brush oscillographs
and a plotting table with two recording arms. The machine,
which has a high Speed of operation, gives a solution to many
types of problems in less than a minute,
In addition, the laboratory has several smaller sections
of computing equipment:
1. A g-c analog computer consisting of equipment similar
to that used in REAC.
2. A medium-speed single-axis flight table.
3. A high-speed 8ingle-axis flight table.
4, Equipment for generating the following types of noise:
a. Continuous noise with a Gaussian amplitude proba-
bility distribution ang various power spectra.
b. Square-wave noise with fixed amplitude but with
random times of changing from positive to negative
polarity.

c. Discrete variable noise avallable on teletype tape.

The various groups of equipment in the laboratory may be used
independently or may be interconnected as required for the

particular problem being studied.

Instrumentation Laboratory. The Mathematics Group of the
Instrumentation Laboratory has an electronic znaloz computer
called REAC which was developed by the Reeves Instrument Corpora-
tion. REAC has seven integrators, and can therefore solve
ordinary differential equations up to the 7th order (or three 2nd
order simultaneous ordinary differential equations). It also
has four servos which, although they are mechanical, permits
the machine to handle non-linear processes. One servo can,
for instance, perform three multiplications (or divisions)
with a single input. Resolvers allow for insertion of sine and
cosine functions. The machine has 24 scale factor potentiometers.
Solutions are recorded on input-output tables.

Since the machine only takes from 30 to 60 seconds to solve
a problem once 1t has been set up, it 1s clear that most of the
time Involved in solving a problem is in setting it up, choosing
a proper scale, etc. The use of boards on which problems can be
pre-patched illustrates its flexibility: by merely changing
boards, the machine can go from solving one problem to another
almost immediately. The accuracy 1s of the order of 2%.

The Group has available a smaller scale high-speed
Electronic Analog Computer which seems somewhat similar to
the Macnee machine. This machine solves linear equations only,
but a 3000:1 time scale permits instantaneous solutions which

complement the 1:1 time scale (T =1 second) involved iA the


0

use of REAC. The machine can also display unstable solutions
to problems.

There is also in use in connection with the above a Tracking
Control Simulator designed for a particular system. This machine
appears to be somewhat analogous to the Flight Simulator avail-
able in D.A.C.L. Passive networks are also used to simulate par-
ticular systems. A cathode-ray-tube-type function generator is
used in conjunction with this computer.

Another machine in use is a Fourler Synthesizer which can
add sine and cosine functions of various frequencies. In other
words, the machine sums Fourier series. It can handle 24 har-
monies at one time. Answers are tracked on tape.

Mention should also be made of a ‘home-made' Auto-Correlator
which calculates the auto-correlation function {ets f(t+c) of
a given function f(t). It also calculates | £{t) ana £2(2).
This machine is not very accurate due to tracking difficulties

and is in little use.

Center of Analysis. By far the largest analog computer in
use at the Institute is the M,I.T. Differential Analyzer. This is
not the original differential analyzer that was introduced at M.I1.T
tn 1930 (and now no longer here), but a newer and larger machine
that was placed in operation in 1942. It is under the supervision
of the Center of Analysis,

The machine is electro-mechanical, the value of a variable
being represented by the angle through which a rotating shaft
turns. In addition to the basic arithmetical operations, the

machine performs integration and functional data insertion


| -18-

(it performs the general integration { av as contrasted wlth the
operation (uae of the electronic analog computer). There are
18 integrators, each having an average approximate accuracy of
0.01%. There are 4 tables available for input and output of

data and results. Two of these have automatic curve tracing
devices which permit the insertion of arbitrary experimental
data.

A recent addition to the machine Lac “een a Vector Con-
version Device which permits the conversion from rectangular
to polar coordinates and vice versa. It can also be used for
generating sines, cosines, and other trigonometric functions.
Other recent additions are the provision of three 4-Shaft Adder
Units which permit addition or subtraction of as many as 4
variables simultaneously.

The Analyzer 1s generally used for the solution of simul-
taneous sets of non-linear ordinary differential equations. The
available 18-integration capacity and associated input and
output equipment permits the solution of very complex problems,
e.g., the simultaneous solution of & to 8 second order differen-
tial equations, It can also be used for synthesis and analysis
of complicated control problems of various types. The machine
has an approximate accuracy of .01% and a solution time of about
15 minutes.

A prime distinction between this machine and earlier models
is the ease with which 1t may be set up for solution of compli-
cated problems. JSpecifically, a two-wire data transmission system
employing cross-bar switches and relays is used for interconnection

purposes. Punched tapes for machine instruction allows one to

reconnect the machine at any later time with a minimum of effort.

Electrical Engineering Department. The Electrical Engi-
neering Department has in its possission an analog type com-
puter called the Network Analyzer. This machine is especially
adapted to the solution of simultaneous quadratic equations
whlch occur in problems of electric power transmission. The
machine essentially contains a model of a power system and is
consequently somewhat less adaptable to problems of a more gene-

ral nature.

Statistical Services. Statistical Services possesses a
large number of I.B.M. Punched Card Machines. The following
equipment is available:

024 Numeric Key Punch

031 Numeric Key Punch

036 Alphameric Key Punch
075 Sorter

O77 Collator

055 Verifier

403 Alphabetic Tab (MLP)
40% Alphabetic Tab

513 Automatic Summary Punch
552 Interpreter
602A Calculator

604 Electronic Calculator
856 Cardatype

The over-all operation is divided into two principal cate-
gories: (A) Mechanization of Administrative Offices. (B) Scien-
tific Computations. Under (A) there is involved services for
various offices and departments of the Institute.

Prom the standpoint of (B), the two most important machines
are the 602A and 604 calculators. These are digital machines

which operate on cards, each card containing 80 characters (digits).


-20-

The 602A is elsdtromeananiont and performs the basic arithmetic
operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and dlvision.
In addition, it has provision for programming computations. It
will take 300 to 3000 cards per hour, depending on the com-
plexity of the problem involved. The numbers involved may be

as large as 12 decimal digits.

The 604 is an electronic calculator which uses a coded binary
number system internally although input and output are in the form
of decimal numbers. In addition to the basic arithmetlc operations
and programming, the 604 has a mechanism for comparison. The
speed of operation is a constant 100 cards per minute. However,
since each card may involve as many as 6 to 8 operations (multi-
plications, say), the machine is capable of performing close to
50,000 operations per hour. The machine will take either 5 or 10
decimal digits. The output ie handled by a printer which has a
rate of printing of 100 cards per minute.

To facilitate the machine's versatility and flexibility,
about 15 permanent boards are wired up for immediate insertion
into the machines. Among these may be mentioned boards for
special function generation, integration, correlation, polynomlal
evaluation, solution of simultaneous equations, inversion of
matrices, etc.

Among the many types of problems that have been treated
very recently for groups within M.I.T., are the following:

(1) Auto-and cross-correlation computations.
(2) Evaluation of characteristic roots of matrices.

(3) Solution of high-order polynomial equations.

(4) Computation of logarithmic, exponential,
frequency response tables.

(5) Solution of integral equations.
(6) Solution of boundary value problems.

(7) Fourier series analysis.

Digital Computer Laboratory. The Digital Computer Laboratory
has built a large-scale high-speed electronic digital computer

 

called Whirlwind I, This is a general purpose digital machine
and will of course solve 211 problems that can be reduced to
the basic arithmetical operations. It is one of the largest
machines of its type in existence.

The machine utilizes a binary number 8cale and handles
numbers which have 16 binary digits (equal to spproximstely
43 decimal places), although it can be programmed to handle
numbers with more digits. Its high speed of operation is
indicated by the ability to perform 5000 multiplications per
second. Incidentally, most of this time is consumed in getting
numbers to and from storage units.

The problem of storage capacity is always a considerable one
in machines of this type, and development of Whirlwind to its full
capacity is still continuing. When finished, it is expected that
it will be equipped to store up to 2,048 words, where as word can
be either a number or a (coded) instruction. At the present time
storage capacity is up to about 1,000 words.

Input and output can be arranged in connection with any of
the following units: typewriter, perforated paper tape, magnetic
tape, magnetic drum (to be installed sometime in 1952), or osell-

loscope display. The machine has built-in identity checks and


“22

alarms to detect errors, and facilities for the location of
troublesome components.

Whirlwind has been used to solve problems involving non-
linear parabolic partial differential equatlons, matrix inver-
sion, algebraic equations, transcendental equations, combinatorial
problems, correlation functions, and synthesis problems in which

one has to make guesses and analyse them.

Computing Groups. Scattered throughout M.I.T. are various
desk computer groups which generally do work associated with
the group to which they are attached. These include the fol-
lowing groups:

(1) The Joint Comput ing Group which does work for the following
groups: R.L.E., Nuclear Science, Acoustics and Solid State.
There are 9 computers and 11 Marchants in this group which is
somewhat distinguished from the others in that they themselves
set up the problems given to them for machine computation.

(2) The Numerical Analysis Laboratory has 21 desk computers
consisting of 15 Marchants, 4 Monro&s, and 2 Fridens. In
addition, they have 2 National Cash machines. At present, they
have 10 people working as computers, although the number is
usually somewhat larger.

(3) The Instrumentation Laboratory Computing Section has availl-
able 10 Monroes, 9 Marchants, and 14 Fridens (3 of which ares of the
hand-crank type). Some of the machines are on loan, but 28 of
them are used regularly by the 28 girls they have working for
them.

(4) The Aeroelastic and Structures Research Computing Section


23

comprises 21 machines and 20 computers. Of the machines, 15 are

Marchants and 6 ars Fridens,

(5) The Supersonic Wind Tunnel Computing Group 1s made up of 5
computers with 5 Marchants.

(6) The Computation Group of Meteor-Engineering has 5 computers
and 5 Fridens.

(7) The Center of Analysis and Statistical Services together
have 6 machines (5 Fridens, 1 Marchant) which are used in
conjunction with their other work. At present, two part-time
computers are employed.
(8) The Computing Group of the Dynamic Analysis and Control
Laboratory has 5 computers and 8 Marchants. The major activity
of the group is the carrying out of numerical integrations
which are used as check solutions for the D.A.C.L. generalized
computer.

In addition, there are contalned in many departments vari-
ous individual desk calculators, which are not, however, used

on a regular basis by salaried computers.
