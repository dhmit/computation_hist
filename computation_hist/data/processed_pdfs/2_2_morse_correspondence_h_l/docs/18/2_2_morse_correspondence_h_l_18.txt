National Chairman oa
Joint Computer Committee Fry

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

Dear Mr. Weiner: ’

As present national chairman of the Joint Computer Committee,
1 am writing to invite the Eastern Joint Computer Conference and
Exhibition to hold either ite 1959 or 1960 convention in Boston.

1 think the 1955 conference with its attendance of 1250 people
clearly demonstrated that Boston is a suitable site for such a conference.
1 am therefore advocating that we seriously consider making Boston one of
the permanent sites for the rotational plan currently used for site
location. I am sure you are aware of the growing concentration of elec
tronic industrial development in the Boston area -- we have two UNIVAC's
in Boston, one 704 end a second 704 will be installed in the new
MIT Computation Center in February of 1957. The experience I obtained
during the 1955 Eastern Joint Computer Conference will make it much easier
to run the succeeding meeting here. I have made preliminary checks regarding
local interest in such a meeting, and find it most enthusiastic! As a
matter of fact, I am enclosing leters of invitation fxom the following
individuals:

Christian A. Herter, Governor, Commonwealth of Massachusetts
John B. Hynes, Mayor, City of Bostom

Ernest Henderson, President, Boston Chamber of Commerce

E. C. Sherry, Manager, Convention and Tourist Bureau

which indicate the widespread interest in having your group meet with us
in the near future.

1 shall, of course, attend the 1956 EJCC and would like to attend
the National Joint Computer Committee meeting to extend this invitation in
person,

to determing the time of your meeting.

Sincersly yours,
