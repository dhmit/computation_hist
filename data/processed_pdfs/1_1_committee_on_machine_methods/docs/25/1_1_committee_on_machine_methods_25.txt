The meeting wes taken up with a discussion of appli
ations for assistantships for next y=ar. It was decided to
continue assisiantships for next year for the following pres nt
holders of assistantships: N. H. Hieks and Phyllis A. Fox i:
Mathematics, S. Rubinow, F. J. Corbato, M. C, Newstein, L.
Sartori, and A. Temkin in Physics.

Tt was decided to mske new appointments to Mr. J. &,
O'Donnell in the Chemical Engineering Department, to Messrs.
>. Aronson, R. L. Martino and A, Ralston in Mathematics and 0
3. Combelic, M. Rotenberg and A, Duren in Physles. H. Glantz
in Mathematics and J, L. Uretsky, J. L. Lebowitz and R.-D. =
Haun of Physics wers other promising candldates. Decision on
these last persons was deferred untll the next meeting. Morse
meanwhile 18 to sce how many assistantships the present fund
can afford naxt year. : :

Morse reported that Professor Hildebrand has indicate
an interest in giving a first-term courss in Numerical Analysis
for seniors and first-vear graduate students, partially %o take
the place of Kopal's courses. It was suggested that perhaps
Dr, Groseh could give a second-term course, continuing the r1b-
jeet and that the othér course in machine programming could Ie
tied in with theses. It was suggested that this would bes a viel
topic for the April meeting of the Committee.

Morse alco reported that Dr. Rubinow had complete. a
first draft of a survey of M.I.T. Computing Machines which 12s
to be distributed. After comments and suggestions had been re-

ceived on this fivst draft, the report would then be put Ino
more permanent form if this sppeared desirable.

It wae decided to have another meeting at 2 p.m.
