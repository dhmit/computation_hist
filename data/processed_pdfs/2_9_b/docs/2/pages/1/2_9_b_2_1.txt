Dear Professor Morse:

We noted with interest the announcement of
the recent Industrial Liaison Symposium on Artificial
Intelligence. We had planned that a Bendix repre-
sentative would attend this meeting, but other pro-
blems interfered at the last minute.

I am writing to inquire if any of the material
discussed is available in written form. If so, we
would very much appreciate receiving a copy.

Yours truly,
