Dear Professor Morse:

I have read with considerable interest your
paper -- I hope it was not considered a secret document --

"The Application of Digital Computer's to Social and Opera-
tional Problems: Opportunities and Needs."

I was quite interested in the emphasis you gave
to the possibilities for work in the Social Sciences. I
should like the opportunity to hear more about this from
you and your social science colleagues at PET. May I
hear from you?

Sincerely yours,
