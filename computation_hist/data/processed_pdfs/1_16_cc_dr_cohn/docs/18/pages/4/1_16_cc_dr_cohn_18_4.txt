hen a subsequence of values of p exists which tends to inﬁnit
and which permits equations (2) and (3) to be satisﬁed by a 0' and r lying insidy
the open intervals just mentioned. We ﬁnd it convenient to select a still ﬁne:
subsequence for which the values of (7 ﬁt the description of one of the cases listed
in the adjoining table. By referring each case to equation (2), we find the asym »
totic relationship thereby implied between a and ,7. These results are listed E1
the next column of the table. Now using this information, we can calculate the
asymptotic value of the left hand member of equation (3), (which supposedl v
holds). But these values, listed in the last column, are easily seen to be nod»
vanishing, hence the proof by contradiction is complete.
