(Ordinarily, programming and card punching have to be done by the programmer. If
assistance is needed from the Center, special arrangements have to be made.)
Estimate of machine hours to complete production runs from tested program:
__________
For cataloging purposes, how would you index this problem? For example, mathema-
tics, logic, game, etc. If this is a mathematical problem, specify type(s) such

as integration, partial differential equations, matrix theory, etc.

If this is a mathematical problem, specify numerical methods used, such as

Gauss' quadrature method, difference equations, Crout, etc.

On one or two additional sheets write sections A, B, and C as follows:

Section A: A one-paragraph abstract of Section B and C.

Section B: Complete description of problem background which should give com-

field of research. Give references to earlier or relateu work and
indicate relation to this work.

Section C: Description of numerical and computer techniques to be used, and
justification of their adequacy or indication of how adequacy is
to be determined. This description should include, when perti-
nent, the number of significant figures accuracy required at
