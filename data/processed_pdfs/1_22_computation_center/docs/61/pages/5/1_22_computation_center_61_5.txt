Equipwent, Perscnnel ang Budget

The Buggested budget for three years is tentative and is
more dependent on Cur abllity ‘to hire one or two more experts in
computer Programming than on the amount of Work to be done, I we .
can find more men of the right sort, more work can be done. Duri
the calendar year 1957 we may not be able Co find more than one
.8enjor man, one or two post-doctoral fellows and g couple of tech-
nical assistants. By the fall of 1957 we may be able to persuade
one or two faculty members of the Cooperating institutions to Spend
appreciable fractions of their time at the Center, working on some
. 0f the problems mentioned earlier, A sultable fraction of thelr
Salaries should bhe carrled by the r'ésearch funds of the Center
and, 1f the work. is in the social Sclences, would be chargeable
to the proposed grant. Some of the experiments in “"gaming" will
require special input or output equipment. Therefore it may turn
out that less than 35,000 will be spent the first year, more than
335,000 the Second. The important point, however, is that begcause
of the presence of the equlipuent of the Center, supported by IBM,
the majority of the budget of this grant can be Spent on salaries
for people directly carrying out the research outlined in this '
proposal. : .

The staff ean begin to be assembled this Spring, but
expenditures would Probably not reach full rate until the Summer
of 1957, Consequently, the grant ecould officially start March opr
April 1957, or could start as late ag June, 1f some earlier
eéxpenditures could be charged against the grant at that time.
