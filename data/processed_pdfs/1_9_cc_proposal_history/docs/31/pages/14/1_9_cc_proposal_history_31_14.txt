Sl
counts how many times the amplitude falls within a glven interval.
The machine can alBo be arranged to make counts for conditional
probabilities. |

It should be mentioned that machines (1), (2), and (3) are
all analog devices, essentilally electronle, and the accuracy
obtainable is of the order f 1% to 5%.

Also under construction is a machlne for solving integral
equations. This will have inpu® and output units which will
yield information {(iterations, say) digitally on punched tape
although it will be an anaiog device.

A 5-channel analog correlator is also being built under the

supervision of Professor Reintjes.

Dynamic Analysis and Control Laboratory. This laboratory
designed, constructed, and now operates a large-scale analog com-
suting machine called the M.I.T. Fiight Simulator. The major
application of the Simﬁlator is in the solution of probiems asso-
ciated with the flight of alrborne vehicles. It is composed of
the following btwo main parts: ‘

(1) A.Egzgngimensional Flight Table which is capable of slmu-
lating the angular motions of an alrcraft about & point of

space. Provision is made for mounting some actual flight-
contrcl components on the table. The table with an assoclated
aerpdynamic computing section forms a complete computing facillty
in which the motions of the table are controlled on an accelera-
tion servo basis.

(2) A Generalized Computer particularly adapted for solving non-

linear ordinary differential eguatlons with tinme-varying coef-
